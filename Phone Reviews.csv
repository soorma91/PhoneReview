Galaxy Core,5,"09 JULY 13
      
      CERTIFIED BUYER
      
      SHOCKED BY LOW REVIEWS
      
      IT IS A VERY GOOD PHONE, ALMOST ALL EXPERT REVIEWS SAYS IT. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE COMPARE IT TO OTHER WHILE WRITING REVIEWS.
      
      FOCUS ON THE PHONE'S PERFORMANCE.
      
      1. 1.2 GHZ DUAL CORE GIVES GOOD PERFORMANCE, EVEN IN HIGH QUALITY GAMES.
      
      2. 1GB RAM IS A GOOD DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO GAMING AND RUNNING APPLICATIONS.
      
      3. SCREEN SIZE IS GOOD, LOWER THAN GRAND, BUT HIGH THAN S DUOS.
      
      4. GOOD GPU AND SCREEN RESOLUTION. EVEN PLAYS TEMPLE RUN 2 WITHOUT LAG.
      
      5. 5MP CAM IS ALSO GOOD, PEOPLE WHO SAY ITS VERY LOW, EXCUSE PLEASE, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY PHOTOS, HAVE A CAM. STILL PHOTO QUALITY IS VERY NICE.
      
      6. INTERFACE IS GOOD.
      
      7. ANDROID JELLY BEAN 4.1 IS AMAZING.
      
      8. HAVE ACCELEROMETER AND COMPASS.
      
      9. PHONE TURNS OFF SCREEN WHEN USER IS NOT VIEWING IT, THUS SAVES BATTERY.
      
      10. 1800 MAH BATTERY IS BETTER THAN NOKIA LUMIA'S 1300 MAH EVEN.
      
      11. FRONT CAM ALSO THERE.
      
      
      I HAVE FOUND THE PHONE GOOD. BUT IF YOU WANT MORE, SPEND SOME MORE BUCKS AND BUY AND SAMSUNG GALAXY S4, AND COMPARE THAT WITH ALL OTHER PHONES.
      
      
      PRICE IS A ISSUE, IT SHUD HAVE BEEN PLACED AROUND 13000, IN 15000 OR MORE, SAMSUNG SHUD GIVE SUPER AMOLDED DISPLAY."
Galaxy Core,5,"A GREAT MODEL BY SAMSUNG FOR YOUNGSTERS. THIS IS THE PHONE WITH LOW COST AND HIGH TECH SPEC.
      
      1.SOME PERSON TALKING ABOUT HANGING.
      
      IF YOU OPEN MANY APPS WHICH USING INTERNET OF 2G DATA PACK, IT IS OBVIOUS.
      
      2. BATTERY
      
      I DON'T FIND ANY ISSUES IN THIS SECTION. IF SOMEBODY IS COMPLAINING THEN HE IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO USE SMARTPHONES.
      
      3. TALKING ABOUT LOW SOUND
      
      SOUND IS GOOD BUT IF YOU EXPECT SOUND LIKE CHINA MOBILE THEN YOU ARE FOOL.
      
      (EXPECTING LOUD SOUND WITH GOOD BATTERY &AMP; ANDROID JELLYBEAN AMAZING., HAHAHA)"
Galaxy Core,5,"AM USING THIS FONE SINCE 6 MONTHS,IT RUNS SO FAST AND WORKS SO SMOOTHLY...I'LL RECOMMEND DONT BOTHER AND GO FOR IT."
Galaxy Core,5,"AS I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, I GOT ALL THAT IN IT. AMAZING SPEED, GOOD CONFIGURATION AND BEST OPTION IN IT'S PRICE RANGE. AGAIN SAMSUNG AS A BIG AND GOOD BRAND IN RESPECT OF MICROMAX, LAVA AND OTHER CHEAP CHINESE MADE OPTIONS, IT'S A REALLY GOOD BUY. NO NEED TO SAY ABOUT FB DELIVERY, I GOT THE PHONE IN TIME AS EXPECTED. SO THANKS TO FB ALSO FOR IT BUT THE PRICE WAS SLIGHTLY HIGH THAN THE MARKET RATE WHICH I COMPARED LATELY.
      
      
      THE GOOD THING ALSO ABOUT THE PHONE WAS, I GOT 2 MONTHS FREE 3G DATA PLAN WITH IT WITH THE LIMIT OF 2.5GB PER MONTH USAGE. AND THE PHONE GIVES AMAZING PERFORMANCE IN 3G IN BROWSING AND WATCHING VIDEOS."
Galaxy Core,5,"BATTERY BACK UP IS GOOD IT COMES AROUND ONE AND HALF DAYS, SCREEN SIZE IS NICE, NET SPEED ALSO NICE, COMPARE TO GRAND HANDLING IS VERY EASY.... OVERALL ITS AN DECENT ANDROID PHONE...."
Galaxy Core,5,"EVERY ONLINE PURCHASE OF PRODUCT REQUIRES 3 COMBINATIONS, IF THESE 3 BRIDGED THEN ONLINE SHOPPING IS A PLEASANT ONE. THE SELLER, THE QUALITY PRODUCT, AND THE DELIVERY. WS RETAILER AND FLIPKART ALWAYS THE BEST IN THEIR PROFESSION. WS'S GENUINE PRODUCT AND FLIPKART'S EXPRESS DELIVERY VERY IMPRESSIVE. ABOUT THE PRODUCT THIS ONE IS BEST IN ITS SERIES, AMBLE RAM, PERFECT OS, AND DISPLAY PERFECT, EASY TO HANDLE."
Galaxy Core,5,"EXCELLENT PHONE WITH VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY.
      
      GOT GOOD DEAL AND UNEXPECTEDLY EXCELLENT DELIVERY ON TIME WITHIN A DAY."
Galaxy Core,5,"FLIPCART DELIVERY WAS EXCELLENT
      
      INFACT IT IS THE BEST
      
      HOWEVER I FIND AMAZON ALSO OFFERING VERY GOOD DEALS. AT TIMES BETTER THAN FLIPCART"
Galaxy Core,5,"FOLKS MY RECOMMENDATION FOR ALL WHO WANT A GOOD PHONE WITH LOW BUDGET AND YET WANT TO ENJOY THE FEATURES OF HIGH END PHONE... GO FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE. I CHECKED OUT A GOOD NUMBER OF PHONES FROM SAMSUNG, SONY, HUAWEI, ZOLO, MICROMAX AND FINALLY DECIDED ON SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE AS MY BUDGET WAS 10-12K. I HAVE TESTED IT IN ALL ASPECTS USED INTERNET IN 3G AND EDGE AND PLAYED SOME HEAVY GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN AND SUBWAY SURFERS. ITS WORKS LIKE BREEZE... NO DELAYS NO HANG ..ITS WORKING PERFECTLY GREAT. THE ONLY ISSUE WITH IT WAS THE VOLUME OF THE SPEAKER IS LOW BUT IF ONE CAN USE THE RIGHT KIND OF AUDIO ENDODING OR AUDIO/VIDEO PLAYERS THEN THIS LOW VOLUME ISSUE GETS SORTED OUT. I HAD THIS PROBLEM INITIALLY BUT NOW I HAVE INSTALLED SOME APT AUDIO VIDEO PLAYERS WHICH GIVE ME GOOD VOLUME."
Galaxy Core,5,"GALAXY CORE IS ANOTHER AWESOME PRODUCT FROM SAMSUNG, FEATURES ARE GOOD. SCREEN RESOLUTION IS GOOD, PHONE PERFORMANCE IS VERY NICE. VIDEO CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT THAT MUCH GOOD.OVER ALL NICE BUDGET SMART PHONE FROM SAMSUNG.DELIVERED THE PRODUCT WITH IN 2 DAYS WITH GR8 PACKING THANKS FLIPKART."

      PERFORMANCE IS COOL
      
      STYLE AND DESIGN IS AWESOME
      
      WHEN WE HIGH RESOLUTION GAMES  IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE PLAYING IN S2
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL WHO WILL BE STATISHFIED WITH 1 GB RAM"
Galaxy Core,5,"GOOD PRODUCT RECEIVED. WELL PACKED AND SHIPPED. RECEIVED BEFORE SCHEDULE DATE. SUPPLIER IS GENUINE.

      I INSIST TO PURCHASE THIS PHONE IF YOUR BUDGET IS BETWEEN 10000-13000
      
      PLEASE GO FOR IT
      
      
      THANKS"
Galaxy Core,5,"HI,
      
      
      I HAVE ORDERED SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE ON 11TH NOV'13 BY NIGHT WITH THE HELP OF FLIPKART EXECUTIVE AS I MOSTLY PREFERRED CHIC WHITE COLOR. I AM VERY HAPPY ON FLIPKART SERVICE AND THE DELIVERY WAS MADE ON 13TH NOV'13 MORNING... AMAZING !!
      
      
      THANKS FLIP KART TEAM"
Galaxy Core,5,"I AM A FLIPKART BUYER SINCE 1 YEAR. AGAIN, EXCELLENT DELIVERY FROM FLIPKART.
      
      LOW PRICE WHEN COMPARE TO OTHER SELLERS..WONDERFUL PRODUCT WITH NO DAMAGE. EXCELLENT PACKING..OVERALL SATISFIED WITH FLIPKART."
Galaxy Core,5,"I AM USING CORE FOR 1 MONTH AND I CAN TELL U THAT IT IS LAG FREE MOBILE.DUE TO 1 GB RAM AND DUEL CORE PROCESSOR IT CAN BE USED FOR MULTITASKING. 5 MP CAMERA IS AWESOME IT CAN CAPTURE GOOD PHOTOS.IT CAN PLAY COMMON GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN,2,FRUIT NINJA WITHOUT ANY ISSUE.IN CASE OF SUBWAY SURFER I FACED A BIT LAG BUT IT WAS PLAYABLE.IT CAN PLAY VIDEOS UPTO 480P. U CAN PLAY 720P VIDEOS WITH HELP OF MX PLAYER IN S/W DECODING,BUT THERE IS LITTLE BIT OF LAG WHILE PLAYING 720P VIDEOS AS THE PROCESSOR DOES NOT SUPPORT HD VIDEOS. 1080P VIDEOS CANNOT BE PLAYED ON THIS MOBILE.SO IF U LIKE TO WATCH HD VIDEOS THEN I RECOMMEND U TO BUY SONY XPERIA M OR SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS 2. BATTERY DRAINS VERY QUICKLY DUE TO THE USE OF WIFI OR PLAYING GAMES BUT ITS COMMON IN ALL ANDROID MOBILES.I CAN SAY THAT IT IS GOOD BASIC MOBILE.IF U WANT TO BUY A MOBILE WHICH HAS GOT GOOD INTERNAL MEMORY,RAM AND U DO NOT LIKE TO WATCH HD VIDEOS ON MOBILE THEN THIS IS THE BEST MOBILE.IF U GOT BUDGET OF AROUND 14000 THEN I WOULD RECOMMEND TO GO FOR MOTO G."
Galaxy Core,5,I AM USING FROM LAST 4 MONTHS THIS IS GUD ONE ON THIS PRICE. IF UR BUDGET IS BTWEEN 10000 AND 15000 TAKE IT.
Galaxy Core,5,I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE FLIPKART SERVICE AS WELL AS WITH THE PRODUCT. GALAXY CORE IS VERY NICE PHONE. IF YOUR BUDGET IS AROUND 10-15 K THEN U CANT GET A BETTER PHONE THAN THIS. ALL THE FEATURES INCLUDING CAMERA AND PICTURE QUALITY IS AWESOME.
Galaxy Core,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AND GOT BEFORE THE STANDARD DELIVERY.
      
      THIS PHONE IS SIMPLY AWESOME, I AM FACING NO PROBLEM WITH THIS. JUST THE BATTERY IS LITTLE BIT LESS.
      
      AND IT WILL BE MORE GOOD AFTER BUYING POWER BANKS.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. DISPLAY IS AMAZING. VIEWING ANGLES ARE VERY GOOD.
      
      2. THERE IS VERY LITTLE LAG IN THE PHONE WHICH IS OBVIOUS.
      
      3. CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD AT DAYLIGHT AND BETTER THEN MICROMAX CANVAS 4.
      
      4. HEAVY GAMES LIKE ASPHALT 7, VIRTUA TENNIS, NFS MW RUNS SMOOTH.
      
      5. AFTER INSTALLING PLENTLY OF APPS AND GAMES, THIS PHONE HAS 350 MB FREE RAM.
      
      6. SCREEN SIZE IS GOOD RATHER THAN BIG 5 INCHES.
      
      7. CALL QUALITY AND MEDIA QUALITY SOUND IS GOOD.
      
      8. ACCELEROMETER AND COMPASS WORKS WELL.
      
      9. GOOD GESTURES LIKE SMART STAY, SHAKE TO UPDATE ETC.
      
      10. 8 CONTINUOUS SHOT IN BEST PICTURES AND 20 CONTINUOUS SHOTS IN NORMAL QUALITY.
      
      11. MANY OTHER CAMERA FEATURES LIKE SMILE SHOT, CARTOON ETC.
      
      12. FACE UNLOCK ALSO WORKS VERY WELL.
      
      13. DO NOT GO TO MICROMAX, KARBONN, XOLO BECUSE THEY PROVIDE LOW QUALITY SPECS.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. CAMERA NOT UP TO MARK IN NIGHT PHOTOS BUT GOOD CONSIDERING PRICE.
      
      2. VGA CAMERA BUT GOOD DURING SKYPE.
      
      3. VOICE INPUT SOMETIMES DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT SPOKEN.
      
      4. HOPE TO ANDROID 4.4 KITKAT UPGRADE.
      
      
      JUST GO FOR THIS PHONE IN THIS PRICE. IT IS BETTER THEN XPERIA M, AND MMX, KARBONN, XOLO PHONES."
Galaxy Core,5,"I BUY THESE HANDSET FROM LOCAL MARKET IN PRICE OF 13K. WITH 4.3INCH SCREEN, 1GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, 1GB OF RAM, 8GB INTERNAL MEMORY(ONLY HALF FOR USER BUT ENOUGH FOR ME), 5 MEGA PIXEL WITH FLASH. ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT IT'S NOT SUPPORT FULL HD VIDEOS OF 1080P EVEN NOT RECORD 720P &AMP; 1080P BUT 800X400 NOT BAD FOR PHONE LIKE THESE. ITS SUFFICIENT FOR ME TO PLAY THE MOVIE THAT  I DOWNLOAD FROM TORRENT WITHOUT ANY HANG. ITS NOT RECORD 720P VIDEO BUT YOU CAN PLAY 720P VIDEO IN THESE HANDSET WITH MX PLAYER IN S/W MODE WITHOUT ANY LAG.
      
      
      THERE'S A LOTS OF HANDSET IN THESE PRICE RANGE WHERE U CAN GET SOME MORE FEATURES BUT THESE IS BEST FOR ME IN LOOK, PERFORMANCE ETC."
Galaxy Core,5,"I BUYED THIS 2 MONTHS AGO FROM MY NEARBY SHOP.......
      
      IT IS JUST AN AWESOME PHONE ......... IT HAS A GREAT SMOOTH TOUCH...
      
      VALUE FOR MONEY..GREAT CAMERA FEATURES
      
      100 TIMES BETTER THAN ""NOKIA LUMIA""AND ""SONY XPERIA"" MOBILES IN THIS RANGE...
      
      IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN"""""" GRAND QUATTRO"""""""" IN TERMS OF THE PRICE
      
      I REQUEST BUYERS TO NOT THINK ON THIS MOBILE SO MUCH AND JUST BUY IT EITHER FROM FLIPKART OR FROM UR NEARBY SHOP"
Galaxy Core,5,I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE A WEEK AGO. OVER ALL PERFORMANCE IS VERY NICE. WE CAN BUY THIS PHONE. GUI IS FANTASTIC.
Galaxy Core,5,"I HAVE PURCHASED 4 FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY MEMBER.
      
      VERY NICE PRODUCT. VERY GOOD SPEED.
      
      ATTRACTIVE  LOOK
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS OK,
      
      FEATURES LIKE ALL ANDROID PHONE.
      
      RAM IS SUFFICIENT FOR GAMING AND NET USING
      
      VIDEO CALL - OK
      
      NO HANG PROBLEM.
      
      
      ALL APPS WILL INSTALLED IN PHONE MEMORY AND THERE IS NO OPTION FOR "" MOVE TO CARD"".
      
      BATTERY BACK UP IS AS LIKE OTHER PHONE , IN 3G LESS BACKUP COMPARISON TO 2G CONNECTION."
Galaxy Core,5,"I JUST LOVE THIS PHONE WITH SO MANY APPS AND FEATURES .
      
      THE TOUCH, SOUND AND CAMERA CLARITY IS MERVALLOUS"
Galaxy Core,5,I PURCHASED THIS MOBILE RECENTLY FOR MY FRD. ITS ROCKING AND THANKS TO FLIPKART SPEED DELIVERY (WITHIN 2DAYS).
Galaxy Core,5,I SATISFIED WITH THIS FEATURES.BUT LITTLE BIT SLOW WHEN I AM USING THIS PHONE IN MINOR SITUATIONS.MOBILE EXPERIENCE IS GOOD.
Galaxy Core,5,"I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD PHONE AND I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      I WILL SUGGEST TO GO FOR THIS PHONE. THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY."
Galaxy Core,5,"I WAITED A FEW WEEKS BEFORE WRITING A REVIEW SO THAT I COULD GIVE A PROPER OPINION. FIRST OFF, IT IS REASONABLY SLIM, SLIGHTLY ON THE HEAVIER SIDE (BUT THEN, ITS A DUAL SIM PHONE, SO ITS EXPECTED). THE SCREEN IS BRIGHT AND CLEAR, THE PHONE IS VERY FAST AND THE BATTERY LIFE IS MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED - LASTING ME AN ENTIRE DAY OF MODERATE TO HIGH USAGE WITH 3G TURNED ON. THE CAMERA IS NOT SO GREAT, BUT I DON'T USE IT ALL THAT MUCH. ONE THING TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY IS THAT THE PHONE USES MICRO-SIM CARDS. SO YOU'LL HAVE TO GET THE SIM-CARDS CUT DOWN TO SIZE."
Galaxy Core,5,"I WANTED A PHONE WHICH WOULD BE FAST ENOUGH TO SUPPORT BROWSING AND WORKING ON FILE PLUS LISTENING TO MUSIC AND CHAT, ALL IN PARALLEL, WOULD FIT IN POCKET COMFORTABLY, HAD AN OK SCREEN SIZE A GOOD CAM. AND THIS ONE HAS IT ALL.
      
      
      WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
Galaxy Core,5,"I WAS BOTHERED A BIT BY THE BATTERY ISSUE.
      
      
      BUT AFTER USING IT FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS NOW I FOUND BATTERY STAND IS BETTER THAN S2 EVEN.
      
      
      ITS SIMPLY SUPERB AT 11,500 BUCKS. WITH AN APP GRAVITY SENSOR, USING THE MOBILE GIVES A FEEL LIKE S4.
      
      
      DISPLAY, SMOOTHNESS IN PERFORMANCE, CAMERA, SMART ALERT, JELLY BEAN,.... STILL MORE FEATURES MAKE IT A SMART CHOICE.
      
      
      TO END UP, I TRIED ALL MOBILE BRANDS IN THIS RANGE. THIS STOOD UP UNIQUE AMONG THEM."
Galaxy Core,5,"I WAS USING A BB BOLD 9780 BEFORE SO I'MUSED TO FAST NET BROWSING AND FAST CHATTING.
      
      WELL TYPING IN A TOUCH SCREEN CAN BE A NUISANCE BUT WITH ADVANCE SOFTWARES THESE DAYS THE PHONES KNOW WHAT YOU WILL WRITE IN ONE MONTH AND PROMPTS YOU.SO VERY HAPPY WITH THAT.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE : DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN HIGH END GAMES.THOUGH IT DOES RUN LOTS OF GAMES QUITE EFFICIENTLY.IM NOT MUCH OF A HEAVY GAMER. SO DOESN'T MATTER FOR ME.NO LAGS SO FAR.
      
      MAKE SURE YOU HAVE UTILITY APPS ON YOUR PHONE , CLEARING THE CACHE FROM TIME TO TIME AND FREEING YOUR RAM AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE AND PROPERLY CLOSE YOUR APPS.IF YOU DO THOSE YOUR PHONE WIL BE A BREEZE TO BROWSE.
      
      
      NET BROWSING: FAST VERY FAST. DEPENDS ON YOUR CONNECTION THOUGH.IM VERY SATISFIED.
      
      
      BATTERY: GOOD ID SAY.AGAIN USE APPS AND SHUT DOWN ALL BACKGROUND APPS THAT DRAIN YOUR BATTERY.
      
      
      MEMORY: 4.7 OUT OF 8 GB INTERNAL AVAILABLE. GOOD ENOUGH UNLESS YOU ARE A HEAVY MUSIC LISTENER OR A GAME BUFF. U CAN ALWAYS EXTEND.
      
      
      CALL QUALITY: GREAT, BUT USING A BIG PHONE FOR LONG HOURS CAN BE CUMBERSOME,THANKS TO THE EFFICIENT HEADPHONES.TALKING WAS NEVER EASIER. NO NOISE CANCELLATION THOUGH.
      
      
      SCREEN: 4.3INCHES IS BIG ENOUGH FOR A GUY. ANY BIGGER AND WONT FIT IN MY JEANS.SO THI SI THE IDEAL SIZE.GREAT RESOLUTION.DECENT PPI DISTRIBUTION.720P VIDEO COMPATIBLE.
      
      
      CAMERA: DECENT CAMERA.NOT SLOW AS MANY REVIEWS SAY.I MEAN HELL ITS A PHONE NOT A DSLR.SO YEAH EFFICIENT ENOUGH.PICTURE QUALITY NICE!
      
      
      OVERALL ITS A GOOD PHONE. GO FOR IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SPEND.I REMEMBER I BOUGHT A SAMSUNG PHONE BACK IN 2010 , IT WAS A TOUCH SCREEN MOBILE PHONE AS WELL.COST ME 10K BACK THEN AND PRACTICALLY HAD NOTHING.SAMSUNG HAS COME A LONG WAY. WELL DONE.
      
      
      ONLY CON SO FAR: PHONE HEATS UP SLIGHTLY ON HEAVY USAGE,SOMETIMES IM PALYING A GAME WHILE RUNNING BACK GROUD APPS PLUS DOWNLOADS THIS PHONE GETS HEATED UP. BUT OTHERWISE THE HEATING IS OK.YOU WONT NOTICE IN   FEW DAYS.IT NATURAL TO HEAT UP.GIVEN THE THIN FRAME IT HAS WITH A DUAL CORE RUNNING INSIDE! ALSO YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY ADJUST THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS AS AND WHEN REQUIRED.SOMETHING MY PREVIOUS PHONE JUST DID ON ITS OWN."
Galaxy Core,5,"I WERE USING THIS FOR A PAST 1 MONTH AND ITS JUST AWESOME.
      
      
      DISPLAY: DECENT PERFORMANCE
      
      
      NO LAGS NO HANGS.
      
      
      HEAD PHONES WHICH IS IN PACK IS DAM WASTE.
      
      
      SOUND CLARITY NOT GOOD..... BUT THAT'S OK FOR ME..."
Galaxy Core,5,IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GOOD CONFIGURATION WITH LESS PRICE THEN I SUGGEST YOU T GO FOR THIS. IT HAS 1.2 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND 1 GB RAM WHICH MAKE IT MORE USABLE. NORMALLY ALL THE ANDRIOD PHONES VERY SLOW SO RATHER THAN SPENDING 20 OR 30K ITS BETTER TO GO FOR GALAXY CORE. I GOT THIS FOR JUST 11.5K AFTER 10% CASH BACK HSBC BANK.
Galaxy Core,5,"I'M USING THIS PHONE FOR A MONTH AT LEAST AND WORTH A PIECE OF MONEY.HAVE TESTED WITH LOT OF APP AND THIS ONE IS BINGO...
      
      WHEN USED SAFE AND ANY DEVICE IS WORTHY..
      
      THE DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS INSTANT,WE JUST ORDERED IN THE EVENING GOT THAT DELIVERED THE NEXT DAY AFTERNOON.
      
      THEN FEW DAYS LATER ORDER   FLIP COVER AND MEM CARD WHICH IS VERY MUCH SATIFACTORY AND THE DELIVERY WAS AS USUAL AMAZING.."
Galaxy Core,5,"IT IS A V.V.V GOD PHONE.THE NET IS VERY FAST AND 3G . I LIKE THIS PHONE
      
      SERVICE CENTERSAND FOR THOSE WHO DOESNT KNOW, THIS IS DUAL ACTIVE PHONE. NOT JUST DUAL STAND BY. OF SAMSUNG IS THE BEST.SO I REQUEST THOSE PANDITS DONT GIVE YOUR FALTU REVIEW. GO HOME N BYE HTC OR OTHER BRAND AND EXPERIENCE DIFFERENCE WHEN WILL GO TO SELL YOUR MOBILE AFTER 1-2 YRS.

Galaxy Core,5,"IT WAS A AWESOME PHONE FROM SAMSUNG IN RESPECT TO ITS PRICE AND FEATURES SAMSUNG HAS LAUNCHED ITS ONE OF THE FABULOUS SET GALAXY CORE
      
      
      I HIGHLY APPRECIATE THIS PHONE"
Galaxy Core,5,"ITS A GOOD MOBILE WITH ALMOST ALL FEATURES.MOREOVER KEEPING IN VIEW THE PRICE,ITS THE MUST AWAITED MOBILE.DON'T MISS IT."
Galaxy Core,5,"ITS A NICE PHONE WITH SOME ADVANCED FEATURES LIKE SMART STAY,SMART ALERT, AND TURN OVER TO MUTE/PAUSE. ALSO ALMOST ALL HIGH END GAMES WORKS FINE AND YOU CAN ENJOY THEM. MULTI- TASKING IS JUST GREAT AND THERE IS NO LAG IN SWITCHING BETWEEN APPS. BROWSING EXPERIENCE IS GOOD AND SPEAKER VOLUME IS A LITTLE LOW AS COMPARED TO OTHER SAMSUNG PHONES LIKE GRAND, ETC. BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS NOT GOOD. USING THIS PHONE WITH TWO SIM CARDS WITH ACTIVE DATA PACK CAUSES DRAINAGE OF BATTERY IN JUST 1-1.5 HOURS MAX. REST ALL FEATURES ARE GOOD."
Galaxy Core,5,"ITS A VERY GOOD PHONE FROM SAMSUNG IN MID RANGE WITH 4.3 INCH SCREEN. IT IS A IDLE PHONE FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN LARGER 5 INCH SCREEN, PROCESSOR IS ALSO FAST ENOUGH TO HANDLE HEAVY GAMES AND VIDEOS. BOTH SIDE CAMERA IS GIVEN WITH FLASH."
Galaxy Core,5,"ITS AN EXCELLENT MID RANGE SMART PHONE.
      
      HERE ARE THE PROS AND CONS:

      CONS:
      
      1. CAMERA IS OK.
      
      2. HEADPHONES COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AS THE PROVIDED ARE BASIC"
Galaxy Core,5,"ITS AN LOVELY PRODUCT OF SAMSUNG, I BOUGHT ON FLIPKART ON SEPTEMBER ITS AN SMOOTH HANDSET ITS WORKING SMOOTHLY BUT ONLY THING IS THAT MY KNOWLEDGE IN THIS PRICE ANOTHER BRANDS HAVE A QUADCORE PROCESSER."
Galaxy Core,5,"ITS AWESOME, SOME REVIEW SAYS IT WILL STUCK AND NOT WORK PROPERLY BUT I DO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM. SOME PEOPLES MAKE NEGETIVE COMMENT"
Galaxy Core,5,"ITS ITHE BEST PHONE BUT NEED A UPDATE OF 4.3 VERY SOON AND WILL ROCK YOU ALL !!!! FLIPKART IS SELLING IT ON A LOW RATE OTHERWISE IT IS 14 THOUSAND IS ITS MARKET PRICE AND IS HAVING VERY COOL FEATURES :D AND I LIKE IT TO MUCH BUT I DID NOT BUYES IT FROM FLIPKART I BUYED IT FROM SAMSUNG E STORE BECOUSE IT GIVES YOU ADDITINAL BENIFITS COMPARED TO FLIPKART , FLIPKART  JUST GIVES YOU THE SAME PHONE IN LESS RRATE BUT OTHER ADDITIONAL FEATURES AE NILL I AM NOT GIVING STARS TO FLIPKART BUT ONLY THE PHONE"

      GOOD BATTERY BACKUP(LASTS 8-10 HRS WITH WIFI/3G DATA USAGE)
      
      GOOD SCREEN EVEN THOUGH SCREEN PPI IS LOW
      
      LOOKS ARE RICH(GO FOR WHITE ONE)
      
      ONE THING THAT DISAPPOINTS IS THE  REAR SPEAKER...IT IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH, BUT THE AUDIO OUTPUT THROUGH EAR PHONE AND  AUX CABLE IS GOOD.
      
      VOICE CALLING N SKYPE(FRONT CAM IS MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED) EXPERIENCE IS BRILLIANT..!!
      
      WHEN IT COMES TO GAMING I HAV PLAYED ASPHALT7 N IT WORKS SMOOTHLY WITH OUT MUCH LAG..!!
      
      
      DNT GIVE A SECOND THOUGHT ... GO FOR IT N U'LL NEVER REGRET...!!

Galaxy Core,5,"MY FRIEND IS USING THIS MOBILE FROM PAST 6MONTHS, NO PROBLEM I USE TO PLAY GAMES ALOT. HE TOO USING MOBILE INTERNET CONTINUOUSLY, BATTERY BACKUP IS LITTLE LOW DUE TO CONTINUOUS INTERNET. OTHER THAN THAT A VERY GOOD MOBILE."

Galaxy Core,5,"THIS IS THE BEST ECONOMIC PHONE THAT IS AVAILABLE WITH A 1GB RAM... ITS 4GB INTERNAL STORAGE LETS US INSTALL ALMOST ALL THE APPS WE NEED. ITS DISPLAY IS QUITE GOOD, BUT NOT A AMOLED DISPLAY. BUT THAT'S OK FOR AN ECONOMIC PHONE.
      
      
      THE GAMES WHICH RUNS WITHOUT LAG ARE:
      
      ASPHALT 7
      
      ASPLALT 8 (A LITTLE LAG - BUT NOT SO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE)
      
      AND MANY MORE."

      INTERNET SPEED ALSO GOOD
      
      DISPLAY N SCREEN SENSITIVITY - EXCELLENT
      
      
      IT IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER PHONES IN THIS RANGE LIKE XPERIA-M N ALL.. I AM NOT SAYING THAT THIS DEVICE HAS NO PROBLEMS, BUT THEY ARE NEGLIGIBLE. (LIKE BATTERY BACK UP - EXACT 1 DAY)
      
      
      FOR THE PPL WHO R CONFUSED BETWEEN XPERIA M &AMP; THIS PHONE, I SUGGEST YOU NOT TO THINK TWICE AND JUST GET SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE.. TOTAL VALUE FOR MONEY"
Galaxy Core,5,"WITH A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND JELLYBEAN, THIS PHONE IS REALLY SNAPPY. SAMSUNG HAS DONE IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS TOUCHWIZ INTERFACE BUT IT COULD STILL USE SOME MORE. OVERALL, GREAT PHONE AND PERFECT FOR SUB 15K."
Galaxy Core,5,WORTH OF MONEY FOR THIS PRICE RANGE. FAST ENOUGH FOR GAMING. VERY MINIMAL LAG. OPTIMAL PICTURE QUALITY AND 3G VIDEO CALLING.

      4.  DON'T KNOW WHY THIS PHONE IS GETTING HOT WHEN SPEAKING OVER VIBER/SKYPE ON WIFI OR 3G.
      
      I NEVER FACED THIS PROBLEM WITH MY OLD S 2."
Galaxy Core,4,"A GOOD PHONE, WORKS EFFICIENTLY. GOOD LOOKS AS WELL AS FEELS GOOD WHEN HOLDING. ONLY BATTERY BACK UP IS NOT SUFFICIENT WHEN USING GPRS. OTHER THAN THAT A GOOD BUY IN THIS PRICE RANGE..."
Galaxy Core,4,AMAZING PHONE .. IF YOUR BUDGET IS 11K- 13K THEN GO AHEAD AND BUY.. EXTREMELY FAST. GOOD CAMERA. GREAT BATTERY LIFE.. NO HICCUPS AS SUCH.
Galaxy Core,4,AWESOME PHONE WAT A CAMERA EVERYTHING IS PERFECT ONLY ONE PROBLEM IS D BATTERY BACKUP[ WHICH IS COMMON IN MOST ANDROID PHONES AND A LITTLE LAG IN GAMES BUT IN 13K U CANNOT EXPECT BETTER DAN DIS
Galaxy Core,4,AWESOME PHONE WITH AWESOME SPECS...:) THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED WELL WITHIN TIME...AND THE GENUINITY  IS UNDENIABLE...A BETTER CHOICE THAN THE MORE FAMOUS GALAXY S DUOS 2....BT AS USUAL THE BATTERY LIFE CUD HAVE BEEN BETTER....THEN AGAIN...THIS IS A PROBLEM FACED BY ALL ANDROID USERS....SO AGAIN THERES NO PLACE FOR ANY COMPLAINTS....
Galaxy Core,4,"BEST BRANDED PHONE IN THAT PRICE GROUP. LITTLE PROBLEM WITH BATTERY, SOMETIME SWITCHED OFF BELOW 20%.
      
      THANKS F.K :)"
Galaxy Core,4,"BOUGHT THE PHONE AROUND ONE MONTH BACK. ITS A PRETTY PHONE. BEST ONE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING PHONE FOR LESS THEN 15K WITH COMFORTABLE SIZE.
      
      
      ITS WELL PERFORMING AND M LOVING IT. JUST FEW PROBLEM ARE THERE THAT I HAVE FACED TILL DATE.
      
      1. SOMETIME (HAPPENED 2-3 TIMES TILL DATE) PHONE DONT SHOW THE DISCHARGING STATUS. IT HAPPENED WHEN IT WAS 100% CHARGED. NOT EVERTYM WHEN ITS 100% BUT IT DID HAPPEN.
      
      2. IT DOESN'T GO BELOW 10%. IT GETS SWITCHED OFF BELOW 10% AND DON'T EVEN BOOT IF U TRY WITHOUT PUTTING IT ON CURRENT.
      
      
      I M NOT SURE IF IT IS PHONE OR SOFTWARE PATCHES/UPDATES WHO IS ACTING WEIRD. SO I STILL WONT STOP LOVING MY PHONE HERE.
      
      
      HAPPY WITH THE SIZE, AMAZINGLY LIGHT WEIGHT AS COMPARED TO SAME CLASS PHONES, CAMERA QUALITY, VIDEO PLAYBACK AND ALL OVER PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      GOOD TO BUY PEOPLE!!"
Galaxy Core,4,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT ON NEW YEAR EVE (IT'S 31ST DECEMBER). IT'S BEEN IN USE FOR ALMOST 3 WEEKS NOW AND THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
      
      
      1. DESIGN; ITS HIGH TIME, SAMSUNG SHOULD RELOOK INTO ITS DESIGN POLICY. A FRESH DESIGN IS LONG AWAITED. THE PHONE LOOKS SAME AS GALAXY S1 LAUNCHED MORE THAN 3 YEARS AGO.
      
      
      2. HARDWARE: JUST BARE MINIMUM, IF YOU WISH TO USE ADD-ON SOFTWARES LIKE TRUECALLER, SWYPE KEYBOARD, AND  LIVE WALLPAPERS ETC.
      
      
      3. SCREEN: CERTAINLY NOT THE BEST AT THIS PRICE, BUT OKAY, SAMSUNG SHALL UPGRADE IT TO QHD ESPECIALLY THE NEW 4.7 INCH VERSION.
      
      
      WILL UPDATE AS WILL USE MORE----"
Galaxy Core,4,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2 DAYS BACK. ITS AN EXCELLENT MID RANGE SMART PHONE.
      
      HERE ARE THE PROS AND CONS:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. AWESOME BRIGHT DISPLAY. PICS AND VIDEOS COME OUT BEAUTIFULLY.
      
      2. CALL QUALITY AND MUSIC PLAYBACK IS GOOD.
      
      3. JELLY BEAN OUT OF THE BOX.
      
      4. FITS PERFECTLY IN HAND.
      
      5. LOOKS GOOD WITH FLIP COVER AND MATTE FINISH SCREEN GUARD.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. CAMERA IS DECENT BUT NOT GREAT.
      
      2. HEADPHONES ARE BASIC. COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
      
      3. BATTERY GOES DOWN VERY QUICKLY WHEN MOBILE NETWORK IS ON.
      
      4. SAME FORM FACTOR AS OTHER SAMSUNG DEVICES."
Galaxy Core,4,"BRAKES FILMS IN 264 H, MPEG4, NOT A GOOD CAMERA .. APPLICATIONS ARE EASY TO INSTALL, I'M ALREADY USING HALF OF THE YEAR, I AM SATISFIED, AT THIS PRICE, THE PHONE IS VERY SUCCESSFUL."
Galaxy Core,4,"EXCELLENT!!!  NO COMPLAINTS - TOTALLY HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE.  I GIFTED IT TO MY HUSBAND AND HE GOT TOTALLY HOOKED ON TO IT.  HE HAD BEEN USING A NORMAL KEYPAD PHONE TILL THEN WITHOUT WHATSAPP, ETC AND WAS ALWAYS AGAINST TRYING A TOUCH SCREEN SMART PHONE.  BUT ONCE HE GOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE FEATURES, HE GOT TOTALLY FASCINATED BY IT.  IT'S HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
Galaxy Core,4,"FANTASTIC MOBILE. VERY NICE DISPLAY. 1GB RAM IS PLUS POINT. CAMERA QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD. DESIGN IS OK,EASY TO HOLD IN HANDS."
Galaxy Core,4,"FEW CONS I FOUND IT
      
      1) SPEAKER VOLUME IS VERY LOW AS COMPARED TO NORMAL LEVEL.
      
      2) BATTERY BACKUP IS BELOW AVERAGE
      
      3) BETTER PLASTIC MATERIAL CAN BE USED FOR THE MOBILE'S BACK PANEL.
      
      
      OTHERWISE EVERY THING WAS GOOD."
Galaxy Core,4,FINE SMART PHONE IN SAMSUNG GAMES LITTLE BIT STRUCKING FINALLY 4 RATINGS FROM MY END .............................................
Galaxy Core,4,"FIRST OF ALL, I APPRECIATE THE BUYERS WHO TAKE THE TIME OUT TO WRITE A DETAILED REVIEW WHICH HELPS US BUYERS TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION BEFORE INVESTING IN A PRODUCT.
      
      NOW, ABOUT THE PRODUCT-
      
      THERE ARE PHONES WITH BETTER SPECS AT THIS PRICE IN THE MARKET BUT MY CHOICES WERE RESTRICTED SINCE I WANTED 1.) GOOD AFTER SALES SERVICE AND 2.) A PHONE WHICH IS NOT TOO BIG, NOR TOO SMALL, I.E, 4.3 TO 4.5 INCHES.
      
      MOTO G WAS A STRONG CONTENDER BUT THE WAITING PERIOD WAS 20 DAYS WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND ALSO, MOTOROLA JUST RE-ENTERING THE MARKET WITH IT, THE AFTER SALES SERVICE WAS A BIG QUESTION MARK AS WELL.
      
      FROM THE REVIEWERS ON FLIPKART IT WAS APPARENT THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT BATTERY LIFE AND SINCE I NEED MY CELL TO NOT DIE ON ME BEFORE MY DAY IS OVER AT 7 PM (ABOUT 12 HOURS OF MODERATE USE), I TOOK MY TIME GOING THROUGH THE OTHER PHONES BUT FINALLY DECIDED TO GIVE IT A SHOT AND WENT FOR SGC (SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE). I COULDN'T WAIT FOR 3 DAYS FOR FLIPKART TO DELIVER IT DUE TO THE PATHETIC CONDITION OF MY PREVIOUS CELLPHONE WHICH WAS BARELY HOLDING UP, SO I BOUGHT THIS HANDSET FROM A RETAILER TWO DAYS BACK.
      
      AS OF NOW, WITH 5/6 APPS INSTALLED, ITS GIVING ME A BATTERY LIFE OF ABOUT 15 HRS (TWO/THREE HOURS OF 3G USAGE AND AN HOUR OF CALLS WITH AN HOUR OF MESSAGING THROWN IN) WITH ONLY ONE SIM SINCE I DON'T NEED TWO EXCEPT WHEN I AM GOING OUT OF STATION AND TWO SIMS DRAIN BATTERY MUCH FASTER.
      
      NO LAGS TILL NOW AND WORKING FINE. GOOD NETWORK THOUGH YOU NEED A REBOOT ONCE IN A WHILE FOR SWITCHING BETWEEN 2G/3G WHICH, FOR ME, ISN'T MUCH OF A DEAL BREAKER. WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW AT REGULAR INTERVALS AFTER INSTALLING MORE APPS AND USING SOME BATTERY SAVING TIPS TO GIVE FELLOW BUYERS A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE.
      
      AS OF NOW, THE VERDICT IS- 4 STARS/ 5STAR
      
      GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT GOOD AFTER SALES SUPPORT AND DON'T MIND CHARGING EVERY 16 HOURS."
Galaxy Core,4,"FLIPKART MADE THAN AGAIN FOR ME...THE DREAM PRODUCT...
      
      GREAT SERVICE AND GENUINE PRODUCT.GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH FLIPKART."
Galaxy Core,4,"FLIPKART SERVICE IS GOOD.
      
      THE PHONE IS GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY.
      
      IN THAT PRICE RANGE OF BUDGET SMARTPHONES, IT PROVIDES MOST OF THE REQUIRED FEATURES.
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, REAR CAMERA, DISPLAY IS GOOD.
      
      IT ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FRONT CAMERA.
      
      8 GB INTERNAL PLUS SUPPORT FOR MICRO-SD STORAGE IS ADDED BENEFIT."
Galaxy Core,4,"FOR THOSE NOOBS SAYING THAT GALAXY S ADVANCE, ACE 3, AND CORE ARE THE SAME, YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW TECHNOLOGY. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THE ANDROID VERSION CORE RUNS ON JELLY BEAN AND S ADVANCE IS GINGER BREAD. ANDROID JELLY BEAN IS BETTER THAN GINGER BREAD IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY, UI, MEMORY MANAGEMENT, ETC.
      
      PROS:
      
      -CORE IS THE ONLY DEVICE IN ITS PRICE RANGE (I.E. LESS THAN 15K INR) THAT HAS 4.3 INCH SCREEN. SCREEN DIMENSIONS MATTER QUITE A LOT.
      
      -SMART PHONES SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH BATTERY FOR 18 HOURS SO THAT USER CAN CHARGE HER GADGET IN THE MORNING FOR THE WHOLE DAY AT WORK. IT'S BATTERY IS ENOUGH FOR THAT.
      
      -5MP CAMERA IS NOT ENOUGH BUT AGAIN THIS PHONE COSTS 13K NOT 30K.
      
      NOT AS MUCH A CON:
      
      -THE MEMORY CLAIMED IS 8 GB THOUGH USER GETS ONLY AROUND 4.5GB FOR HER USE. SAMSUNG MADE UP FOR THIS BY PROVIDING AN EXPANDABLE SLOT.
      
      -DEVICE SHOULD COME IN BLACK COLOUR FOR THE FLAWLESS BLACK LOOK AT THE FRONT. I LOVE THAT.
      
      **AND WHEN YOUR DEVICE FREEZES ALWAYS REMEMBER, ITS THE APP THAT FROZE IT NOT THE MANUFACTURERS FAULT.
      
      I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU BUY THE BEST PHONE IN YOUR BUDGET."
Galaxy Core,4,"FUNTASTIC PHONE ALL FEATURES WHICH MULTIMEDIA PHONE HAVE IT'S COMPLETLY FULLFILLED.
      
      IT HAVING GOOD CAMERA. HEADPHONE IS QUALITY IS GOOD. INTERFACE IS AWESOME AND QUITE ROUGH AND TUFF PHONE. IT'S ALL ABOUT COMPLETE SATISFACTION. I HAD PURCHASED IT 4 MONTHS AGO."
Galaxy Core,4,"GALAXY CODE IS WORTH FOR ITS PRICE. SPECS ARE GOOD. BATTERY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. WITH MINIMAL USAGE ALSO, BATTERY DOESN'T LAST FOR 2 DAYS. GOOD OVER ALL."
Galaxy Core,4,"GALAXY CORE IS A EXTREMELY CLOSE COMPETITIVE OF SONY XPERIA M DUAL. I WAS CONFUSED BEFORE BUYING. BUT AFTER USING THE PRODUCT I AM SATISFIED WITH THE PERFORMANCE IT IS OFFERING WITH THE COMPETITIVE PRICE. BUT I CHOOSE THIS TO HANDLE WITH ONE HAND AND YOU REALLY CANT DO THIS. SAMSUNG DOES NOT HAVE GOOD SPEC PHONE WITH SMALL FORM FACTOR. XPERIA M DUAL HAS ADVANTAGES LIKE IT IS SMALL, HAVE NFC, HAVE GORILLA GLASS, HD RECORDING AND OVERALL LOOK. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE ACCESSORIES OF SONY IS EXPENSIVE. AND SCREEN QUALITY IS BETTER IN CORE (CHECK YOUTUBE VID)."
Galaxy Core,4,"GOOD PHONE FOR SOMEONE MOVING FROM REGULAR MOBILE TO A TOUCH/ SMART PHONE,EASY TO HANDLE ,GOOD FEATURES,VALUE FOR MONEY"
Galaxy Core,4,GOOD PHONE GO FOR IT LITTLE BIT HANGING PROBLEM .... AS SAMSUNG IS KNOWN FOR IT .... BUT OVER ALL GOOD ... I AM USING IT ROUGHLY FROM LAST 4 MONTHS BT WORKING FINE .... GOOD CAMERA QUALITY ... 4GB CAN ONLY BE USED... REST 4 FOR PROCESSING ... GOOD ONE....
Galaxy Core,4,"GOOD SERVICE BY FLIPKART!!
      
      AS PER SPECIFICATION THIS  SET HAS 8GB INTERNAL MEMORY. HOWEVER, I CAN SEE ONLY 4.65 GB. WHERE IS REST OF THE MEMORY? HOW MUCH INTERNAL MEMORY SPACE DOES PRE-INSTALLED OS AND APPS TAKE? I SUGGEST PEOPLE TO BUY MOTO-G BETTER THAN THIS SET (QUAD CORE PROCESSOR, 1280X720 PIXEL VIDEO PLAY/ RESOLUTION, 2080MAH BATTERY, 1.5MP FRONT CAMERA, ADRENO GRAPHICS, 4.5INCHES CREEN)  COMES AT SAME PRICE RANGE."
Galaxy Core,4,"GOOD SMARTPHONE IN THAT PRICE RANGE FROM SAMSUNG. CAMERA RESOLUTION IS BIT OK , BUT IN A 5MP CAM, YOU CAN EXPECT THIS MUCH I FEEL. IF MANY APPS ARE OPEN THEN SOMETIMES PHONE HANGS FOR A WHILE AND IS FINE AGAIN IN FEW SECONDS."
Galaxy Core,4,"HEY THERE,
      
      
      I GOT THIS PHONE ESPECIALLY FOR ITS
      
      
      BRIGHT &AMP; LARGE DISPLAY ( COMPARED TO MENU OCCUPIED SCREEN IN SONY XPERIA M DUAL )
      
      8GB IN BUILT MEMORY ( OF WHICH YOU GET 4.5 GB FOR USAGE )
      
      DECENT 1GB RAM
      
      UHMM, A LITTLE BIT EASY TO USE INTERFACE AS I GOT IT FOR MY DAD.
      
      
      BY THIS TIME, IF YOU ARE IN THE IDEA OF PURCHASING A NEW ANDROID PHONE.
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND GOOGLE'S MOTO G (WHICH COMES IN DUAL SIM) &AMP; DOES COME WITH ANDROID KITKAT.
      
      
      SONY XPERIA M (IN THE SAME RANGE) IS ALSO A VERY GOOD CHOICE IF YOU ARE THINKING TO EXPLOIT YOUR ANDROID, COMES WITH NFC, PRO OF SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR AND LATEST JELLY BEAN AS TO CORE.
      
      
      LET ME CONCLUDE, CORE IS THE BEST FOR LIGHT USERS AND WORTH THE BUCKS. CHEERS."
Galaxy Core,4,"HI I AM USING THIS MOBILE FROM LAST 20 DAYS .ALL THE FEARURS ARE GOOD ,AND ITS MAIN DRAW BACK IS BATTEY BACK UP ,I NEED TO KEEP TWICE A DAY FOR CHARGING (WITH A USE OF MP3 2 HR ,WIFI.USE OF 4-5 HR PER DAY  ).REMAINING ALL IS OK..."
Galaxy Core,4,"HI IAM WRITING THIS MY FIRST REVIEW WITH MY OWN EXPERIENCE TO HELP BUYERS OUT THERE TO MAKE THEIR CHOICE.IN THIS REVIEW IAM NOT GOING TO COMPARE IT WITH ANY OTHER PHONE BUT ONLY HIGHLIGHT WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THIS MOBILE.I BOUGHT FROM A LOCAL STORE ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO FOR 13000.AS THE TITLE SUGGESTS REVIEW WILL BE DETAILED AND COMPLETE,SO DON'T SKIP ON PARTS.
      
      
      DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY :
      
      NOTHING NEW HERE SAME DESIGN AS ALL THE GALAXY OUT THERE.I REALLY THINK SAMMY BOYS SHOULD IMPROVE ON THIS(SPECIAL MENTION SONY).MY PHONE WAS MISTAKEN FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS AT FIRST GLANCE.EVEN THOUGH ITS ALL PLASTIC BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD ,I ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED MY PHONE FACING SCREEN GLADLY NOTHING HAPPENED.SO I MAY ASSURE YOU THAT IT CAN HANDLE SOME OF THAT ACCIDENTAL DROPS BUT FROM A FAIR DISTANCE.
      
      
      DISPLAY :
      
      NOW COMES THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF REVIEW THE DISPLAY.I HAVE SEEN LOT OF SAMSUNG PHONES WHETHER LOW END OR HIGH END THEIR DISPLAY IS TRULY CLASS LEADING. THIS HAS A TFT LCD DISPLAY AND A PIXEL DENSITY 217PPI.THE DISPLAY LOOKS GREAT INDOORS WITH EQUALLY GOOD CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS LEVELS. VIEWING ANGLES THAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE IS GOOD (CANNOT BE COMPARED WITH AMOLED HOWEVER). NOW THE SAMSUNG HAS SKIPPED ON AUTO BRIGHTNESS SENSOR SO YOU WILL HAVE TO MANUALLY ADJUST THE BRIGHTNESS WHICH BECOMES PROBLEMATIC OUTDOORS, GLADLY THE BRIGHTNESS CONTROL IN NOTIFICATION PANEL COMES TO RESCUE
      
      
      HARDWARE AND PERFORMANCE:
      
      NOW COMES ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT.IT COMES WITH ANDROID JELLYBEAN.4.1.2(MAY GET A KITKAT UPGRADE).IT HAS SNAPDRAGON S4 PLAY 1.2GHZ DUAL CORE ARM CORTEX A5 PROCESSOR WITH ADRENO 203 GRAPHICS(ABOUT 1.5-2 TIMES POWERFUL THAN ADRENO 200) 1GB OF RAM,8GB(4.75 GB FOR APPS INSTALLATION) OF INTERNAL STORAGE NOW LOOKING AT SPECS ONE THING THAT MANY EVEN I THOUGHT OF LETDOWN SURELY WILL BE THE ""CORTEX A5"",YES ITS AN OLD ARCHITECTUREBUT THE PERFORMANCE IS NOT THAT BAD AT ALL.IN GENERAL USAGE PHONE PERFORMS FAIRLY SMOOTHLY.PEOPLE WHO ARE INTO GAMING CAN ALSO EXPECT ACCEPTABLE  FRAME RATES EVEN IN SOME OF HIGH END GAMES LIKE ASPHALT 7,NFS,NOVA ETC WITH MEDIUM GRAPHICS (PLEASE SEE GEEKYRANJIT YOUTUBE REVIEW) GAMES LIKE SUBWAY SURFERS,TEMPLE RUN OZ RUNS WITH MINOR LAGS.DO NOTE THAT POWER SAVING MODE IS DISABLED BEFORE GAMING.YES PHONE GET LITTLE BIT WARM(NOT EXTREME) IF YOU GAME CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN 30-40 MINUTES.OVERALL ITS A NICE PERFORMER FOR THE PRICE..
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      IT HAS A 5MP AUTOFOCUS CAMERA WITH A DECENTLY BRIGHT LED FLASH.CAMERA PERFORMANCE IS DECENT,I HAVE SEEN MUCH BETTER 5MP SHOOTER FROM MOBILE PHONES(SPECIAL MENTION NOKIA N82).I WILL SUGGEST YOU TO READ GSMARENA REVIEW FOR SOME DETAILS ABOUT CAMERA PERFORMANCE.VIDEO RECORDING MAXES OUT AT D1(720 X 480),THATS WHAT THE CHIPSET IS CAPABLE OF.THE DETAILS ARE AVERAGE,SOUND RECORDED IS MONO AND LACKS AUTOFOCUS AND VIDEO ZOOM TOO
      
      
      AUDIO AND MULTIMEDIA:
      
      THE AUDIO QUALITY AS EXPECTED FROM A SMARTPHONE IS GOOD.THE ONLY CON HERE IS THE LOUDSPEAKER,THOUGH THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS GOOD THE VOLUME LEVELS ARE AVERAGE AND IN OUTDOORS ARE BARELY HEARABLE .THE MUSIC THROUGH HEADPHONES ARE GOOD TOO.
      
      NOW COMING TO VIDEO PLAYBACK IT MAXES OUT AT 480P,THOUGH SOME LOW BITRATE (LESS THAN 2MBPS) 720P VIDEOS LIKE MOVIES ARE PLAYABLE IN SW DECODER MODE IN MX PLAYER.
      
      
      NETWORK AND CONNECTIVITY :
      
      I MUST HAVE TO SAY THAT SIGNAL RECEPTION WITH BOTH SIM ON IS ABOVE AVERAGE(MY NOKIA CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS),THOUGH I HAVE NOT FELT ANY MAJOR SIGNAL DROPS.THE VOICE QUALITY IS VERY GOOD (EVEN WITHOUT NOICE CANCELLATION).EVEN IN NOISY ENVIRONMENTS YOU CAN HEAR WHAT PEOPLE AT OTHER END ARE SAYING.
      
      IT OFFERS GOOD SPEEDS IN 2G AND 3G ALSO.ALSO DO NOT THAT IT HAS 3G 7.2MBPS DOWNLINK SPEED.ITS GOOD FOR BROWSING HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO DO HEAVY DOWNLOADING YOU WILL HAVE TO SPEND SOME TIME(SPECIAL MENTION:SOME PHONES ARE CAPABLE OF 21MBPS DOWNLINK IN ITS PRICE RANGE).
      
      ANOTHER THING WORTH MENTIONING IS THAT DURING WIFI TETHERING THE PHONE BECOMES INSANELY HOT ( AT ITS PEAK OVER 50C) AFTER 20-30MINS,HOWEVER I HAVE SEEN WORSE IN MANY ANDROIDS.
      
      
      BATTERY LIFE:
      
      ITS THE MOST ARGUED PART WHEN IT COMES TO SMARTPHONES.THIS PHONE HAS A DESCENT 1800MAH BATTERY.NOW THE TWO POWER HUNGRY TASKS ARE GAMING(GRAPHICALLY INTENSIVE) AND INTERNET(HEAVY DOWNLOADING).NOW IF YOU DO ANY ONE OF THE ABOVE TASKS CONTINUOUSLY THEN BATTERY WILL COME FROM 100 TO 10% IN 3-3.5 HRS SURELY.DURING IDLE STANDBY WITH BOTH SIM ON IT CONSUMES ONLY 1% IN 1 HOUR,THAT MEANS YOU CAN EXPECT AROUND ONE WHOLE DAY WITH MEDIUM TO HEAVY USAGE (WORTH MENTION:SOME LENEVO PHONES IN THIS PRICE RANGE).
      
      ALSO DO NOTE THAT PHONE WILL BECOME HOT IF HEAVILY USED DURING CHARGING.
      
      
      VERDICT:
      
      NOW WHAT I HAVE DONE IS ONLY SHOW YOU WHAT THIS PHONE IS CAPABLE OF WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE WITH IT.IAM NOT SAYING OH THIS IS THE BEST PHONE OUT THERE GO BUY IT,YOU HAVE MANY OPTIONS OUT THERE IN THE PRICE RANGE THANKS TO THE INCREASING COMPETITIONS EVEN BY INDIAN COMPANIES.BUY A PHONE THAT SUITS YOUR DEMAND AND EXPECTATIONS.
      
      THANKS FOR READING"
Galaxy Core,4,"HI,I HAVE PURCHASED IT FROM FLIPKART &AMP; THIS PRODUCT IS VALUE FOR MONEY OVERALL FEATURES ARE GOOD,BUT SOME TIME GOT HANG &AMP; BATTERYLIFE IS LESS I.E. 8 TO 9 HOURS &AMP; IF USED 3G ITS VERY LESS.
      
      
      ANYWAYS BUYING FROM FLIPKART IS GOOD EXPERIENCE."
Galaxy Core,4,"I  HV ORDERED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART N USING FOR LAST 20 DAYS. TILL NOW ITS PERFORMANCE IS VERY GOOD.FLIPKART IS ALSO PROVIDING IT IN AT LEAST RS 1000/- LOWER PRICE COMPAIRED 2 MATKET PRICE. IHV GET RS 1200/- DISCOUNT ON THIS SET.
      
      PROS- 1- RAM IS GUD
      
      2-LOOK IS GOOD
      
      3-PRICE IS GOOD
      
      4-MEMORY ALSO GUD ENOUGH
      
      5- CAMERA IS EXCELLENT
      
      FEW CONS-
      
      1-NO HD PREVIEW
      
      2-BATTERY LIFE IS LOWER, IE, MAXIMUM 1 DAY IN 3G, BUT LAST EVEN FOR 2 DAYS ON 2G IN AVARAGE USAGE
      
      3-NOT SCRATCH RESISTANT
      
      
      ONE MAJOR PROBLEM IS SOME TIME, I DONT KNOW WHY SCREEN IS JAMMED, OR U CAN SAY HANGED FOR FEW SECS N IT IS OVER AFTER DIALING THE HOME KEY, OTHERWISE ITS A GREAT OPTION 2 BUY THIS PRODUCT IN THIS RANGE.
      
      TILL NOW I HV A VRY GUD EXPERIENCE USING THIS PHONE. I WOULD RATE FLIPKART 4.8 N SAMSUNG 4.5 OUT OF 5 RATINGS AFTER USING IT FOR LAST 20 DAYS."
Galaxy Core,4,"I AM FULLY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT AS MY BUDGET. EASY ACCESSIBLY IS THE BEST SPECIALITY FOR THIS PRODUCT. I FELT THE BAD IMPRESSION IS THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HEAD PHONE SOUND AND THE CAPACITY OF BATTERY. OTHER WISE THIS IS VERY GOOD AND I SUGGEST EVERYBODY.
      
      FLIP CART IS VERY BEST ONLINE SHOPPING SITE AND THEIR SERVICE IS VERY GOOD. ONLY THE SUGGESTION FROM ME IS THAT PLEASE RE-ORGANISE YOUR CUSTOMER CARE. THERE IS NO PROPER ANSWER GET US FROM THEIR SIDE. AND ALSO PLEASE MENTION THE PHONE NUMBER OF EKART HUBS OF MAJOR CITIES, THAT WILL HELP THE CUSTOMER TO CLARIFY THE DESPATCH OF THE PRODUCT.

Galaxy Core,4,"I AM SHOCKED BY THE LOW REVIEWS OF FOR THIS PHONE. IT WORKS VERY NICELY AND SMOOTHLY. THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS PHONE OTHER THAN THE BATTERY WHICH WORKS FOR ABOUT HALF A DAY WITH HEAVY USAGE. THE BATTERY SHOULD HAD BEEN OF ABOUT 2100MAH AND IT WOULD HAVE WORKED JUST FINE. BUT CONSIDERING ALL THE SMARTPHONES THE BATTERY WORKS OKAY.
      
      THE PHONE IS FILLED WITH FEATURES AND IS JUST AMAZING. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW AND IT IS WORKING GREAT FOR ME. THE CAMERA IS GOOD, THERE IS ALMOST NO LAGGING. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5STARS IF IT WASN'T FOR THE BATTERY. HAPPY WITH MY PHONE!!"
Galaxy Core,4,"I BOUGHT GALAXY CORE TWO MONTHS AGO FROM A SAMSUNG STORE.ACTUALLY I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY XPERIA M,BUT IT WAS OUT OF STOCK SO I  SETTLED FOR THIS PHONE.SINCE I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR TWO MONTHS,I THINK I AM ENTITLED TO DO A REVIEW
      
      THE PHONE HAS A 4.3 INCH CAPACITIVE TOUCHSCREEN,DUAL CORE PROCESSOR,AND 1GB OF RAM.
      
      IT RUNS JELLY BEAN 4.1.2 AND COMES WITH TOUCHWIZ UI ON TOP.
      
      LOOKS:
      
      IT LOOKS BETTER THAN MOST SAMSUNG'S NEW PHONES BECAUSE OF ITS COMPACT SIZE.
      
      CAMERA:
      
      A 5MP CAMERA AND A VGA CAMERA HAVE BEEN PROVIDED.LOOKS FINE ON PAPER AND WORKS BETTER THAN MICROMAX AND KARBONNS 8MP SHOOTERS.BUT PROVISION OF HDR IS SORELY MISSED.
      
      DISPLAY:
      
      THE DISPLAY IS GOOD. 480X800 RESOLUTION FOR A 4.3 INCH SCREEN IS SUFFICIENT AND LOOKS GOOD.
      
      PERFORMANCE:
      
      THE PHONE HAS A DUAL CORE SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR(MSM 8225) WHICH SOUNDS GOOD BUT THERE IS A CATCH-THE ARCHITECTURE IS CORTEX-A5 WHICH IS OLD,OUTDATED EVEN.THE PHONE CAN STILL RUN MOST GAMES SMOOTHLY IF NOT KEPT IN POWER SAVING MODE.
      
      THE SPEAKERS ARE AWFUL OUTDOORS BUT LOUD ENOUGH INDOORS .ALSO THE PHONE CANNOT PLAY HD VIDEOS EVEN THOUGH THE SOC SUPPORTS HD PLAYBACK.
      
      (TIP:IF YOU REALLY WANT TO PLAY THEM,INSTALL VLC PLAYER.IT WORKS.)
      
      CONCLUSION:IF YOU REALLY WANT A PHONE  FOR CALLS,TEXTING AND MAILING WITH LIGHT GAMING
      
      AND EASE OF USE(I FORGOT TO MENTION: TOUCHWIZ IS BETTER THAN TIMESCAPE AND SENSE PUT TOGETHER) THEN GO FOR IT.BUT IF YOU ARE GAMER AND IN SEARCH FOR A BETTER PHONE,THEN XPERIA M AS WELL AS L(KRAIT ARCHITECTURE WITH ADRENO 305=BEST IN RANGE)ARE THE ALTERNATIVES.
      
      ALSO GALAXY CORE HAS BEEN RUMOURED TO BE GETTING ANDROID 4.4 UPDATE IN 2014
      
      
      PROS:
      
      COMPACT
      
      SLIM
      
      TOUCHWIZ
      
      DISPLAY
      
      
      CONS:
      
      OLD PROCESSOR
      
      SPEAKER QUALITY
      
      NO HDR
      
      
      NOTE:DO NOT BUY THE FLIP COVER IF YOU ARE BUYING FROM SAMSUNG STORE. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY.BUY THE SILICONE COVER(N-CASE,BLACK) FROM FLIPKART INSTEAD.IT FITS WELL AND LOOKS FANTASTIC."
Galaxy Core,4,I BOUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE I8262 IN FLIPKART. THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY FLIPKART IS GOOD AND I GOT IT WITHIN THE MENTIONED PERIOD OF TIME. PACKING WAS VERY NEAT AND I AM VERY HAPPY TOO. NOW I AM EXPECTING 10% CASH BACK FOR MY MOBILE.
Galaxy Core,4,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY COUSIN. A USUAL FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS FLAW-LESS. THE PHONE HAS GOOD FEATURES THAT ANY SMART-PHONE WANTING PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO GOOD, IT DOESN'T LAG WITH SOME MODERATE HEAVY GAMES ALSO. OVERALL GOOD PHONE UNDER 12 K RANGE BY SAMSUNG."
Galaxy Core,4,"I DID NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AS IT IS OVER PRICED HERE (GOT IS  FROM SAMSUNG BRAND SHOP, AT A MUCH LOWER PRICE ).THERE WAS A TIME WHEN ALMOST EVERY THING ON FLIPKART WAS PRICED LOWER THAN MARKET, ALAS... NOT ANY MORE (:
      
      
      NOW COMING TO THE PHONE.....
      
      
      SCREEN: BRIGHT 4.3 INCH SCREEN.... NO COMPLAINS AT ALL.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE: NO LAGS AT ALL INSTALLED 25-30 APPS ON FIRST DAY ITSELF...
      
      TEMPLE RUN,SUBWAY SURFERS,DEER HUNTER PLAYS SMOOTHLY, COMES INSTALLED                   WITH TRIAL VERSION OF HEAVY GAMES LIKE ASPHALT 7 AND PLAY THAT SMOOTHLY TOO.
      
      
      SOFTWARE: COMES WITH NO BLOATWARE  AND ONLY GOOGLE RELATED APPS ARE PRE-INSTALLED, UNLIKE SONY AND LG WHO BUNDLE THEIR PHONES WITH TONS OF UNNECESSARY APPS.
      
      
      CAMERE: JUST OK ...I HAVE A SEPARATE CAMERA FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AND DONT EXPECT A 5MP CELL TO PERFORM BETTER THAN THIS....
      
      
      ACCESSORIES:  EARPHONE EVEN THOUGH NOT A IN EAR TYPE PRODUCES GREAT QUALITY SOUND , THE WIRE USED N EARPHONE, CHARGER ARE OF VERY GOOD QUALITY ( UNLIKE MY PREVIOUS LG PHONE)
      
      
      CALL QUALITY IS GOOD AND DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY ISSUES WITH THAT.
      
      
      TO SUMMARIZE , SAMSUNG HAS TAKEN CARE OF ALL THE BASIC STUFF LIKE SCREEN, BUILD QUALITY, HARDWARE, ACCESSORIES WHICH WE ALL NEED. INSTEAD OF GIMMICKS LIKE TONS OF APPS AND ON THE PAPER IMPRESSIVE SPECS.
      
      
      I WAS USING A LG PHONE EARLIER WHICH HAD FEATURES AHEAD OF ITS TIME, BUT HAD TO REPLACE THE SCREEN IN TWO YEARS, QUALITY OF ACCESSORIES WERE ALSO NOT GOOD.
      
      
      ANOTHER GOOD THING I FOUND IS THAT THE BATTERY IS MADE IN KOREA, CHARGER IN VIETNAM, AND THE CELL ITSELF HERE IN INDIA ....SO NO MADE IN CHINA STUFF, AND THAT INCREASES THE TRUST ON THE BRAND EVEN MORE."
Galaxy Core,4,I GOT THESE PHONE FROM FLIPKART AT SPECIAL PRICE AT 11999 GREAT PHONE ALL IS GREAT AND WHO SUFFERS FROM LOW BATTERY BACKUP THEY SHOULD INSTALL JUICE DEFENDER APP AND NEXT I SHOUL ALSO GIVE SUGGESTION TO WHO ARE CRAZY TO GET THESE I WANT ANDROID 4.2.2 SUCH AS OFFERED BY XOLO OR MICROMAX BUT EXCEPT ALL GOOD
Galaxy Core,4,"I GOT THIS PHONE ON JAN 07 2014. GOOD PHONE..NICE CLARITY, CAMERA. ONLY THING IS THAT IT HANGS SOMETIMES.. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE. DECENT RAM AND INTERNAL MEMORY AVAILABLE TO USER. THE ONLY CON IS THAT BATTERY BACKUP TOO LOW. I HAVE TO CHARGE THRICE A DAY AND BATTERY LEAKAGE IS TOO FAST. BATTERY DROPS BY 5% WITHIN 10 MINS."
Galaxy Core,4,"I HAD BOUGHT THE SAME PHONE SIX MONTHS AGO AND AGAIN BOUGHT ONE FOR MY IN-LAW.  THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE PHONE IS VERY GOOD.. WE CAN PLAY GAMES WITHOUT ANY DRAG.. BROWSE WELL..
      
      BUT WHEN YOU SWITCH ON THE MOBILE DATA.. IT DOESN'T ACTIVATE LOT OF TIMES AND YOU NEED TO GO TO AIRPLANE MODE(OR RESTART) AND RETURN BACK TO SEE IT ACTIVATED.
      
      I SEARCHED THIS ON WEB AND FOUND THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM ON ALMOST ALL SAMSUNG PHONES.  SO NOTHING AGAINST THIS MODEL IN PARTICULAR."
Galaxy Core,4,"I HAVE BEEN THIS PHONE FROM LAST FEW MONTHS, THE KIND OF USAGE I HAVE INCLUDES, USING IT A S NORMAL PHONE FOR PICKING AND MAKING CALLS, USING WHATSAPP, NORMAL BROWSING, PLAYING GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN, CANDY CRUSH ETC. ALSO USING IT FOR LISTENING SONGS AND WATCHING VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE OR OTHER APPS PROVIDED BY ANDROID PLAY STORE. SO IT WORKS FINE FOR ALL THESE NEEDS,  YES ALL OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED APPS ARE NOT USED FREQUENTLY DAILY EXCEPT ONE OR TWO. SO PRETTY MUCH THIS PHONE HAS WORKED FINE TILL NOW.
      
      
      OFF LATE I AM FINDING THE PROBLEM WITH BATTERY, NEED TO RECHARGE IT ALMOST DAILY PRESENTLY. ALSO, THE PHONE HUNG ONLY ONCE TILL NOW.
      
      
      ALTOGETHER PRESENTLY SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE GIVEN THE FACT IT LIES IN THE STARTING RANGE OF SMART PHONES."
Galaxy Core,4,"I LIKE USING IT.IT WAS MY 1ST TIME I PURCHASED SOMETHING FROM FLIPKART, I HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE.NOW ILOVE BUYING THINGS THROUGH FLIPKART.I LOVE IT."
Galaxy Core,4,I RECEIVED THIS PHONE ON 4TH FEBRUARY (RECEIVED IT 2 DAYS EARLIER THAN COMMITTED DELIVERY DATE)  FLIPKART OFFERS LOWEST PRICE IN THE MARKET. THIS PHONE LOOKS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ITS PHOTS. I AM 100% SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE. JUST I STARTED USING IT SO I WILL POST DETAILED REVIEW LATER.
Galaxy Core,4,"I USING THIS MOBILE FROM LAST 3 WEEK, ITS COOL AND NICE.
      
      ONLY ONE THING TO SHARE RAM IS ALWAYES SHOWING 80% FULL EVEN AFTER CLEAR IT.
      
      OTHER THINGS ARE SUITE TO ME."
Galaxy Core,4,I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THIS PHONE AND THINKING OF BUYING IT FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND WHEN AT LAST I GOT IT I WAS HAPPY THAT MY WAIT PAID OFF WELL. NICE AND SLIM EASY TO CARRY AROUND. COMPANY SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED WITH A BETTER PROCESSOR WHICH WOULD MAKE THIS AN OUTSTANDING PHONE. SUFFICIENT BATTERY BACK UP AS I AM PERSON WHO REMAINS OUTSIDE ALMOST WHOLE OF THE DAY SO IT IS GOOD FOR ME DONT EXPECT ANYTHING MORE IN THIS PRICE RANGE
Galaxy Core,4,"IT HAS BEEN PLACED TO 12500 AND FOR THAT PRICE RANGE IT IS THE BEST YOU CAN GET FROM SAMSUNG
      
      PREVIOUSLY IT WAS 15000 BUT NOW U CAN NOT SAY THAT IT IS A BAD QALITY PHN"
Galaxy Core,4,"ITS A GOOD HANDSET, ONLY DRAWBACK IS, ITS GETTING HEATED UP WHILE USING INTERNET OR GAMES, ELSE EVERYTHING IS FINE."
Galaxy Core,4,"ITS A NICE PHONE WITH SOME ADVANCED FEATURES LIKE SMART STAY,SMART ALERT, AND TURN OVER TO MUTE/PAUSE. ALSO ALMOST ALL HIGH END GAMES WORKS FINE AND YOU CAN ENJOY THEM. MULTI-  TASKING IS JUST GREAT AND THERE IS NO LAG IN SWITCHING BETWEEN APPS. BROWSING EXPERIENCE IS GOOD AND SPEAKER VOLUME IS A LITTLE LOW AS COMPARED TO OTHER SAMSUNG PHONES LIKE GRAND, ETC. BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS NOT GOOD. USING THIS PHONE WITH TWO SIM CARDS WITH ACTIVE DATA PACK CAUSES DRAINAGE OF BATTERY IN JUST 1-1.5 HOURS MAX. REST ALL FEATURES ARE GOOD.
      
      
      FLIPKART SERVICE IS GOOD AND THIS PHONE IS DELIVERED IN JUST 2 DAYS."
Galaxy Core,4,"IT'S SAMSUNG'S BEST SMARTPHONE BELOW 13K. I DON'T KNOW ""WHY IT'S PRICE GOES UP &AMP; DOWN EVERYDAY ON FLIPKART."" MAY BE BECAUSE OF HIGH DEMAND. BUT IT'S NOT FARE TO SELL A PRODUCT OT 12200 ONCE, SUDDENLY START SELLING IT 12600, LETTING ONLY THE CUSTOMERS TO PAY MORE."
Galaxy Core,4,"JUST GOT MY PHONE DELIVERED YESTERDAY, IT IS A DECENT PHONE , WITH GOOD LOOKS, BIG SCREEN AS COMPARED TO DUOS 2 MAKES IT MORE PRESENTABLE, PLUS THE SAMSUNG GALAXY SERIES HAS ITS OWN ADVANTAGE IN TOUCH DISPLAY .
      
      
      IF YOU DONT WANT TO EXPAND YOUR BUDGET TO MORE THAN 12K AND STILL WANT A VALUE FOR MONEY PHONE YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT."
Galaxy Core,4,"LET ME BEGIN BY COMMENTING ON FLIPKART'S DELIVERY.
      
      I PAID ONLINE AND GOT THE PRODUCT TWO DAYS IN ADVANCE TO WHAT THEY HAD PROMISED INITIALLY.
      
      THE PHONE WAS NEATLY PACKED.LOTS OF BUBBLE WRAP USED.
      
      SO A GOOD JOB THERE BY FK.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS PRETTY GOOD FOR ITS PRICE TAG.
      
      FAST AND HASSLE FREE INTERNET BROWSING.GOOD FOR GAMING.COOL CAMERA.
      
      AVERAGE DISPLAY AND BATTERY.
      
      GAMES SUCH AS TEMPLE RUN 2,ANGRY BIRDS,CUT THE ROPE,ASPHALT 8,VECTOR ARE REALLY SMOOTH.
      
      RANDOM GLITCHES FOR SUBWAY SURFERS ALONE.
      
      
      POSITIVES:
      
      -SMOOTH
      
      -VERY FAST INTERNET BROWSING EXPERIENCE
      
      -BIG SCREEN
      
      
      NEGATIVES:
      
      -SLIGHTLY LOWER BRIGHTNESS
      
      -BATTERY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER(AVERAGE STANDBY IS 1 DAY ON NORMAL USE)
      
      
      FOR MY USAGE THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE ISN'T A BIG DEAL.
      
      SO IF YOUR CRITERIA IS JUST A GOOD ANDROID PHONE FOR MID-RANGE GAMING AND FAST INTERNET ACCESS,GO FOR GALAXY CORE.
      
      IF YOU WANT ""GAMING ON THE GO"",THIS PHONE WILL NOT SUIT YOUR NEEDS.
      
      HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL. GOOD LUCK."
Galaxy Core,4,OVERALL GOOD PHONE IN 12K RANGE...BATTERY  AND CAMERA BOTH ARE GOOD. I THINK LOUD SPEAKER COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
Galaxy Core,4,"PHONE QUALITY IS GOOD THIS GOES TO SAMSUNG..
      
      QUICK DELIVERY OF 1 DAY. PHONE APPLICATIONS ARE WORKING FINE."
Galaxy Core,4,"PRODUCT IS VALUE FOR MONEY , IT'S GOOD AS PER SAMSUNG STANDARD................................................."
Galaxy Core,4,"PURCHASED DURING NOV 2013 WORKING FINE MUCH USEFUL FOR 3G VIDEO N/W CALLING RAM, INTL MEMORY OK SERVICE BY FLIPCART NICE CASHBACK FOR CREDIT CARD RECD

      CHENNAI 14"
Galaxy Core,4,"PURCHASED FOR WIFE. DOING ITS JOB PERFECTLY. HIGHLY RECOMMANDED MID RANGE PHONE. CAMERA IS GOOD. IN SAME PRICE YOU ARE TEMPTED TO GO FOR MICROMAXS OF THE WORLD BUT LOOKING AT THE QUALITY AND AFTER SALES SERIVES OF THOSE GENERICS, THIS ONE IS A WISE CHOICE. HAVE CONSIDERED FEW MICROMAX AND KARBONN MODELS BEFORE FINALIZING THIS ONE."
Galaxy Core,4,"REALLY GOOD PRODUCT IN RANGE OF 12K, VERY EASY TO USE.GOOD CONFIGURATIONS EXCELLENT CAMERA AND SPEAKERS. THANKS SAMSUNG!!!!!."
Galaxy Core,4,"REGARDING SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE..ITS NOT FAR BETTER AS WE EXPECTED. BECAUSE THE CELLFONE IS TAKING SOO MUCH OF TIME TO OPEN THE OPTIONS LIKE WHEN WE ARE OPENING MESSAGE IT TAKES 3-4 SEC TO TO OPEN PROPERLY. ONEY THE BAD THING IN THIS FONE IS, IT HAS ONLY 824MB OF RAM. MOREOVER THE FONE IS AWESOME  WITH GOOD SPECIFICATION. AS OF THE NORMAL PERSONS BUDGET.
      
      I RECOMMEND THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE INSTEAD OF SOME HIGH SPECIFIC FONE."
Galaxy Core,4,"SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE I8262 IS A GOOD BUDGET PHONE. I NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT SPACE PROBLEM AS FACED WITH OTHER 4GB MEM PHONES.
      
      PROS: GOOD CORNING VIEWING ANGLES. INTERNAL MEM USABLE ~ 4GB. GOOD BUILD QUALITY.
      
      CONS: APPS CAN'T BE TRANSFERED TO MEM CARD. ALTHOUGH HAVING 8GB INTERNAL WUD BE HELPFUL.
      
      LAGS A BIT WHILE PLAYING SUBWAY SURFER &AMP; OTHER HEAVY GAMES.
      
      
      OVERALL BEST PHONE IN 13K BUDGET SEGMENT."
Galaxy Core,4,SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE IS AN AMAZING PHONE. POWERFUL PROCESSOR AND 1 GB RAM IS VERY GOOD FOR AN ENTRY LEVEL PHONE. IT CAN PLAY ALL THE GAMES INCLUDING TEMPLE RUN. ITS WORTH THE PRICE !!!
Galaxy Core,4,SUCH A NICE MOBILE. NICE TO CARRY. REALLY A SMART PHONE. SUCH A NICE MOBILE. NICE TO CARRY. REALLY A SMART PHONE. SUCH A NICE MOBILE. NICE TO CARRY. REALLY A SMART PHONE. SUCH A NICE MOBILE. NICE TO CARRY. REALLY A SMART PHONE. SUCH A NICE MOBILE. NICE TO CARRY. REALLY A SMART PHONE.
Galaxy Core,4,"THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE IS...........GREAT.....I LIKE IT....
      
      AND HEATING PROBLEM IS AVG WHILE USING NET......
      
      BUT I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH ITS BATTERY BACK UP,,,......BY CONTIONUS USE THROUGH NET ......BATTERY WILL BE DOWN WITHIN 6-7 HRS..........AND IF THEY LAUNCH THIS SET WITH FULL HD WILL BE GREAT......
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS SUPERB...."
Galaxy Core,4,"THE PHONE IS AWESOME, WITH PLETHORA OF FEATURES.
      
      BATTERY SUCKS @ 1850 MAH, AND DRAINS LIKE VROOM.
      
      AFTER FULL CHARGE WITH NORMAL USAGE, IT WILL STAY FOR 10-14 HOURS ONLY."
Galaxy Core,4,"THE SCREEN SIZE AND BATTERY BACKUP IS EXCELLENT. IT IS A MIDRANGE ANDROID SMART PHONE FROM SAMSUNG. CAMERA IS GOOD. 5 MP IS MORE THEN ENOUGH OF A NORMAL DAY TO DAY PHOTOGRAPHY.
      
      I AM VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH THE SCREEN SIZE. IT IS PERFECT FOR NORMAL SIZE INDIAN HANDS. IT PERFECTLY FITS IN TO YOUR JEANS. NOT LIKE ANY 5 INCH PHONE. 5 INCH SCREEN ARE NOT FOR NORMAL SIZE HUMAN BEINGS. MY PREVIOUS PHONE HAD 5 INCH SCREEN. THAT WAS A PAIN, ADJUST YOUR LIFE ACCORDING TO PHONE.
      
      MY PERSONAL EMAIL AND BUSINESS EMAIL (IBM LOTUS TRAVELER) ARE CONFIGURED, BROWSING EXPERIENCE IS VERY GOOD. TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY MUCH RESPONSIVE.
      
      THIS WILL BE A BEST PICK FOR MID RANGE ANDROID BUYER."
Galaxy Core,4,THIS PHONE IS GOOD AND ALL APPLICATION ARE SO USEFUL BUT AMOLED SCREEN IS BETTER TO LCD SCREEN SO I LITTLE DIS-POINTED.
Galaxy Core,4,THIS PHONE IS SIMPLY SUPER. I NEVER GOT ANY PROBLEM WITH USING THE PHONE. THIS IS 100 PERCENT WORTHBLE FOR SPENDING MONEY
Galaxy Core,4,"THIS PHONE WAS GREAT DEAL WITHIN THE RANGE OF 13000 BUCKS, BUT I FOUND IT VOLUME SLIGHTLY LOW AS COMPERE TO NORMAL LEVEL, OTHERWISE EVERY THING WAS GOOD."
Galaxy Core,4,TS THE BEST PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE. VERY GOOD SMARTPHONE. AN AWESOME PHONE WITH A REALLY FAST PROCESSOR.
Galaxy Core,4,"VALUE FOR MONEY.
      
      FLIPKART PROVIDES AWSOME DISCOUNTS.
      
      THE PRODUCT REACHED ON TIME
      
      AND WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION"
Galaxy Core,4,"VERY NICE AND IDEAL DEVICE BUT BATTERY BACKUP IS NOT GOOD ....
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS MAJOR NEGATIVE POINT............."
Galaxy Core,4,"WORTH A BUY IF LOOKING FOR A DESCENT MIDRANGE PHONE. GOOD DISPLAY, DESCENT CAMERA AND GOOD UI. GOOD ENOUGH FOR A AVERAGE USER.
      
      YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LUMIA 720 AS AN OPTION IF YOU ARE OK WITH WINDOWS AND CAN SHELL OUT 2K MORE :)"
Galaxy Core,3,"A GOOD SMARTPHONE ACCORDING TO ITS COST. IF YOU HAVE A BUDGET NEAR TO THE COST OF THIS MOBILE, THIS IS THE BEST ONE FOR YOU. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A PERSON WHO LOVES GAMING, CHATING AND OTHER APPLICATIONS, THEN LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE AS JUST LIKE GALAXY GRAND IT ALSO GETS HANG A LOT."
Galaxy Core,3,"ACCORDING TO ME ITS NOT A VERY GOOD PHONE. IF YOU ARE A GAMER, PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE. EVEN THE GAME SUBWAY SURFERS IS NOT WORKING WELL. YES IF YOU ARE AN AVID PHOTOGRAPHER, ITS A GOOD OPINION. THOUGH IT HAS A BIG INTERNAL MEMORY AND GOOD RAM, ITS NOT PROVIDING ITS MAXIMUM. THE PHONE LAGS(HANGS) MANY TIMES AND ITS PERFOMANCE GETS WORSENED DAY BY DAY. 3G IS GOOD IN IT. INTERNET BROWSING EXPERIENCE IS EVEN NOT GOOD. OVERALL IF YOU ARE A GAMER-NOOOO, IF YOU ARE A PHOTOGRAPHER, YES, IF YOU WANNA BROWSE NET, NO. THIS PHONE IS JUST STYLISH AND GOOD CAMERA"
Galaxy Core,3,BATTERY IS NOT UPTO THE MARK - OTHERWISE IT IS OK PRODUCT.  I WILL BE TAKING THE HANDSET TO SERVICE CENTRE SHORTLY TO SORT OUT THE ISSUE
Galaxy Core,3,BOUGHT ONE.. A VERY GOOD PHONE WITH GOOD FEATURES... VERY POOR BATTERY.. NEED TO CHARGE AT LEAST TWICE IF APPS ARE NOT USED..  PHONE IS KEPT IN THE CHARGER FOR ALMOST 4 HOURS A DAY.   GET A GOOD QUALITY POWER BANK IF U BUY THIS ONE..
Galaxy Core,3,"DEAR ALL CORE USER'S, MY ANDROID JOURNEY STARTED IN 2010 WITH ALL THE DEVICES LISTED BELOW:
      
      
      FOREIGN BRANDS:
      
      GALAXY ACE, ACE DUOS, S ADVANCE, XPERIA SL, LG OPTIMUS G(CURRENT DEVICE)
      
      DESI(INDIAN BRANDS):
      
      MMX NINJA A56, LENOVO A60,KARBONN A15, LAVA IRIS 501,MMX CANVAS2, XOLO Q800 AND GALAXY CORE(CURRENT DEVICE - BACKUP PHONE).
      
      
      MY REVIEW GIVEN BELOW IS PURELY PERSONAL BASED ON MY USAGE OF THIS PHONE AND NOT RESEMBLING TO ANY PHONES LIVING OR DEAD!!!!(LOL)
      
      
      SINCE I'M AN ADVANCED USER OF ANDROID(ROOTING, FLASHING, MODDING, TWEAKING), MY PERSONAL OPINION ABOUT THIS PHONE IS GIVEN BELOW:
      
      
      NORMAL(DAILY USAGE)/BASIC USER'S: VFM(VALUE FOR MONEY)
      
      ADVANCE USER'S(TWEAKERS): WOM(WASTE OF MONEY)
      
      
      GOOD FOR INTERNET(BASIC USE LIKE FACEBOOK, WHATTS APP) AND FOR DAILY CALLS AND MSGS... NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HEAVY USAGE LIKE WATCHING MOVIES OR HEAVY DOWNLOADING EVEN IN 3G.
      
      
      13240 FOR DUAL CORE??? ALWAYS NO NO... LOOK OUT FOR BETTER ALTERNATIVES LIKE SONY FOR ANDROID AND NOKIA FOR WINDOWS.
      
      
      FOR SAVING BATTERY: USER BATTERYGURU APP FROM PLAYSTORE RELEASED BY QUALCOMM SPECIFICALLY FOR THEIR CHIPSETS... IT SAVES BATTERY CONSIDERABLY....
      
      FOR ROOTED USERS: USE GREENIFY....
      
      
      DISPLAY: IPS PANELS ARE VERY BRIGHT, WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH QUALCOMM PROCESSOR'S EATS MORE BATTERY... AMOLED DISPLAYS ARE SHARP AND SATURATED BUT WILL STRAIN UR EYES... SO, LCD IS OPTIMUM FOR DAILY FREQUENT VIEWING USAGE AND FOR THIS PRICE TOO....
      
      
      I'M NOT REVIEWING ABOUT OTHER THINGS, SINCE ALL ARE ALREADY DISCUSSED, REVIEWED AND RATED HERE....
      
      
      MY PERSONAL FINAL VERDICT: GO FOR THIS ONLY IF YOU ARE A HARDCORE SAMSUNG FAN AND WILL BUY ANYTHING WHICH SAMSUNG RELEASES.....
      
      
      FINALLY, ONLY GOD CAN RELEASE A PERFECT ANDROID PHONE FOR EVERY USER FOR EVERY NEEDS.... UNTILL THEN LET'S KEEP PRAYING....:)"
Galaxy Core,3,"EVERY THING IS GOOD EXCEPT :
      
      1&GT;FREE INTERNAL MEMORY ONLY 4.7 GB INSTEAD OF 8GB . THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST 6 GB FREE FOR US.
      
      
      2&GT;THERE IS NO 720P VIDEO RECORDING AND THE QUALITY IS POOR AND LOW BRIGHTNESS , MEANWHILE MOST OF THE PHONES FROM RS.8K RANGE HAVE 720P VIDEO RECORDING.
      
      
      3&GT;LACKS OF GOOD GPU AND LOW PIXEL DENSITY."
Galaxy Core,3,"FIRST OF ALL THANKS TO FLIPKART TEAM FAR SUCH A QUICK DELIVERY.
      
      THE PHONE IS AWESOME AND RUNS SMOOTHLY BUT ONLY DRAW BACKS ARE IT SUPPORTS MICRO SIM, AND THE PHONE NEEDS GPU FOR CERTAIN GAMES
      
      APART FROM PHONE THE BLUETOOTH HEADSET THAT I GOT FROM FLIPKART FREE OF COST COMES OUT TO BE FAULTY AS ITS MIC DOESN'T WORK. SO I GIVEN A COMPLAIN AND WAITING FOR THEIR REPLY.
      
      AS A CUSTOMER I EXPECT MUCH BETTER SERVICE THAN THIS FROM FLIPKART."
Galaxy Core,3,"FOR THE PRICE RANGE, POSSIBLY THE BEST ANDROID OPTION. SOUND FROM THE LOUDSPEAKER IS ON A LOWER SIDE, BUT UTILITY WISE IT IS VERY OK. SPEED IS VERY GOOD, MY FATHER USES IT WITHOUT ANY COMPLAINTS. HOWEVER HEAVY APPS MIGHT SLOW DOWN THE OS, BUT PERFECTLY FINE FOR ORDINARY USAGE LIKE WATCHING VIDEOS, BROWSING NET, PLAYING LIGHT GAMES ETC.
      
      ALL IN ALL, GREAT IN TERMS OF VALUE FOR MONEY."
Galaxy Core,3,"GALAXY CORE - SNAPDRAGON S4 PLAY - MSM8225 - DUAL CORE A5 PROCESSOR, ADRENO 203 GPU, 1 GB RAM (USABLE 845 MB), VIDEO RECORDING AT 720 X 480P.
      
      GRAND QUATTRO - SNAPDRAGON 200 - 8625Q - QUAD CORE A5 PROCESSOR, ADRENO 203 GPU, 1 GB RAM (USABLE 845 MB), VIDEO RECORDING AT 720 X 480P.
      
      AT THE EXPENSE OF 2 CORES YOU GET SOME SMART FEATURES LIKE SMART STAY, TURN OVER TO SILENT, ACTIVE DUAL SIM, CRISP DISPLAY (LARGER PPI). PERFORMANCE WISE BOTH PHONES ARE ALMOST SAME, CONSIDERING THERE ARE FEW APPS THAT USE 4 CORES. SOME GAMES MAY BENEFIT FROM 4 CORES. FOR EVERY DAY USE CORE IS GOOD."
Galaxy Core,3,GOOD PHONE BUT NOT BEST IN PRICE RANGE I HAVE PURCHASE THESE PHONE IN AUGUST EXPERIA L IS BETTER OPTION FOR BUY BUT I WANT TO TELL ABOUT PHONE CLEARITY WHICH IS EXELLENT THE VOICE IS NOT CLEAR IN SPEAKER. THE CAMERA CLEARITY IS GOOD BUT FEATURE IS NOT I LIKE VERY MUCH. EXPERIA L HAVE BETTER FEATURE OVERALL THIS PHONE IS AVARAGE PHONE
Galaxy Core,3,"HI ,
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2 MONTHS BACK AND HERE IS MY FINDINGS.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. 4.3 INCH SCREEN
      
      2. BRAND NAME SAMSUNG
      
      3. TEMPLS RUN 2 RUNNING GOOD.
      
      4. DUAL CORE PROCESSOR
      
      5. 8 GB INTERNAL MEMORY
      
      6. HEADPHONE SOUND IS GOOD.
      
      7. CAMERA QUALITY IS KIND OF OK. 6/10
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. PROCESSOR:
      
      THOUGH THE PROCESSOR IS DUAL CORE AND 1.2 GHZ BUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE PROCESSOR IS VERY POOR. ARM5 IS KIND OF PROCESSOR WHICH IS USED BY CHEAP COMPANIES AND NOT SO POWERFUL WHEN COMPARED TO EQUIVALENT SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR.
      
      
      2. GRAPHICS: ADRIONO 203 - COMMON IN THIS PRICE YOU CAN GET MUCH BETTER GRAPHICS PROCESSOR. CHECK XPERIA M.
      
      
      3. ONLY 4.75 GB OUT OF 8 GB INTERNAL MEMORY IS ACCESSIBLE.
      
      
      4. SOUND ON SPEAKER SUCKS. BELOW AVERAGE.
      
      
      5. VIDEO PLAYBACK:
      
      VIDEO PAYBACK OF THIS PHONE REALLY BAD. YOU CAN'T PLAY ANY 720P VIDEO. NOT EVEN WITH MX PLAYER AND SOFTWARE DECODER MODE. EVEN THE VERY OLD MODEL PHONES WHICH DOES NOT SUPPORT 720P VIDEO PLAYBACK CAN PLAY VIDEO WITH MX-PLAYER USING SOFWARE DECODER BUT THIS ONE CAN'T. THIS IS REALLY BAD. EVEN FOR 480P VIDEO IT GETS BLURRY FEW TIMES AND ALL THE VIDEO HAD SOME EXTRA REDDISH COLOR.
      
      
      6. YOU CAN'T DO PRECIOUS/ NEXT SONG WHEN THE PHONE IS LOCKED. I USED HTC AND SONY PHONES AND THEY HAVE THIS OPTION BY DEFAULT.
      
      
      7. DISPLAY: KIND OF OK. PPI IS LOW.
      
      
      8. BATTERY BACKUP: NOT GOOD WHEN YOU ARE NOT USING POWER SAVING MODE AND USING DUAL SIM.
      
      
      GO FOR SONY XPREIA M. THAT'S A FAR BETTER PHONE WITH RESPECT TO PROCESSOR/ GRAPHICS/ VIDEO PLAYBACK/ CAMERA/ SOUND QUALITY/ BUILD QUALITY."
Galaxy Core,3,"HI FRENDS..
      
      
      I BOUGHT A GALAXY CORE FROM FLIPKART..5 STAR TO THE FLIPKART FOR  THE EXCELLENT DELIVERY TIME..
      
      IN VERY FIRST FEW DAYS PHONE WAS RUNNING SMOOTHLY.. AFTER A WEEK PHONE GETS HANGED.. SUDDENLY PHONE GETS SWITCHED OFF.. NO BATTERY BACKUP AT ALL.. I HAVE TO CHARGE THE PHONE TWICE IN A DAY FOR 100 % EVEN I DINT INSTALL SO MANY APPS IN MY PHONE.. JUST ONLY WHATSPP AND WE CHAT INSTALLED IN MY PHONE..
      
      I WILL NOT FORGET THE CAMERA QUALITY. EVEN ITS A 5MP CAMERA, BUT THE PICTURE QUALITY IS SO GOOD FOR PHOTO FREEK PEOPLE..
      
      
      DESPITE OF BATTERY BACKUP, PHONE IS MUST BUY"
Galaxy Core,3,"HI I AM USING SAMSUNG CORE FROM LAST 15 DAYS IT IS AVERAGE MOBILE.
      
      
      1.) TOUCH IS OK NOT GOOD
      
      2.) BATTERY BACK UP IS VERRY POOR.
      
      3.) WHILE TEXTING ONLY MESSAGE FEATURE WILL BE HANGUP."
Galaxy Core,3,HI I HAVE PURCHASED GALAXY CORE FOR THE PRICE OF 13250 LAST MONTH..PERFORMANCE IS GOOD..BUT BATTERY BACKUP IS THE CONCERN..IT COMES HARDLY 8 HRS WITH AVERAGE USE..
Galaxy Core,3,"HI
      
      I HAVE PURCHASED THE HANDSET ON 19-JAN 2014 AFTER USING IT FOR 1 WEEK I LIKE THE FEATURES &AMP; CAMREA QUALITY IS GOOD BUT BATTERY BACK UP IS WORST EVEN MY USAGE IS NOT MORE NOT USING 3G OR 2 G OR THE WIFI BUT THE BATTERY DRAIN FAST SO SAMSUNG SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT THE SPEAKER VOLUME IS ALSO LOW I WOULD RECOMMENDE THE USERS FOR NORMAL USE YOU CAN BUY THIS HANDSET BUT IF THE USAGE IS MORE DONT GO FOR IT BCZ THE MAIN ISSUE IS BATTERY BACKUP SAMSUNG SHOULD DO SOMETHING FOR EXCEPTED THE ANDROID PROCESSES RUN IN THE BACKGROUND BUT JUST LIKE TO SHARE THE EXPERIENCE HAVE CHARGE 100 % IN THE MORNING &AMP; EVEN IN 10 MIN THE INDICATOR SHOWS ONLY 90 % REMAINING"
Galaxy Core,3,"HI,
      
      
      THIS IS A VERY BASIC PHONE FULFILLING BASIC DESIRES SUCH AS BRANDED SAMSUNG MOBILE OWNER, 3G, DUAL SIM, 4.3 SCREEN, CAMERA FLASH &AMP; FRONT FACING CAMERA.
      
      
      BUT FOR REST OF PURPOSES LIKE WATCHING A HD &AMP; FULL HD VIDEO, USING SYGIC NAVIGATION, GOOD GAMES, THEN THIS DEVICE IS NOT CAPABLE OF PLAYING IT.
      
      
      NOTE: NAVIGATION(GPS) IS FINE &AMP; ACURATE, ONLY HEAVY GRAPHICS NAVIGATION DISPLAY IS GIVING PROBLEM BECAUSE ITS GPU IS VERY WEAK.
      
      
      HEAVY GRAPHICS GAMES ARE NOT EVERYBODY'S TASTE BUT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THEN THIS IS NOT THE DEVICE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.
      
      
      BACK CAMERA IS AVERAGE BUT THE THING WHICH MAKES THE CAMERA CLARITY MORE WORSE, IS THE TFT DISPLAY. TFT DISPLAY ALWAYS RUIN THE CLARITY &AMP; DETAILS OF VIDEO/PICTURE THAT IS WHY I HATE ALL SONY PHONES. EVEN 40000 SONY MOBILE HAS TFT DISPLAY. SUCKS.
      
      
      WHATEVER IF YOUR DISPLAY IS HD OR FULL HD OR TRILUMIOS DISPLAY, TFT WILL BE WORST DISPLAY.
      
      
      MY SAMSUNG GALAXY S(I9000) DISPLAYS BETTER IMAGES/VIDEO THAN SONY 24000 CRAP.
      
      
      I PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR MY MOM WHO WILL NEVER USE NAVIGATION, WILL NEVER PLAY GAMES, WILL NEVER WATCH HD MOVIES, WILL NEVER TAKE GOOD PICTURES. SO THIS PHONE COMPLETED MY REQUIREMENTS.
      
      
      ALTHOUGH NOW DAYS YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD OPTION OF MOTO G. GO FOR IT.
      
      
      A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY HINDUSTAN TIMES, 95% OF SMARTPHONE USERS WILL NEVER USE 95% OF ITS CAPABILITIES.
      
      
      PEOPLE HAVE THE MOST EXPENSIVE PHONE IPHONE 5S, &AMP; WILL NEVER USE NAVIGATION BUT ALWAYS ASK DESTINATION BY LOWERING DOWN THEIR CAR WINDOW, WILL NEVER USE BANKING ON PHONE BUT WILL ALWAYS GO TO BANK FOR TRANSFER MONEY , WILL NEVER USE DROPBOX &AMP; RELY ON DVDS, WILL NEVER USE ONLINE RECHARGE &AMP; ALWAYS WAIT FOR SHOPKEEPERS TO RECHARGE THE PHONE, WILL NEVER USE PASSWORD MANAGEMENT APPS BUT ALWAYS STRUGGLES TO REMEMBER PASSWORDS, WILL NEVER USE CALENDER &AMP; BIRTHDAY/ANNIVERSARY REMINDERS BUT ALWAYS FORGOT MOM/DAD/BORTHER/SISTER BIRTHDAY , WILL NEVER BOOK MOVIE TICKETS ONLINE BUT ALWAYS STAY IN QUEUE TO GET TICKETS.
      
      
      SO STAY PROUD &AMP; BUY THIS PHONE BECAUSE MOST USERS FALL IN 95% USER CATEGORY. :-)."
Galaxy Core,3,"HI,
      
      GOT THIS PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART ON DEC-30, AS FAR AS FLIPKART SERVICE IS CONCERNED, IT WAS GOOD, AND SINCE I BOOKED IT IN A DAY PROGRAM, I GOT IT DELIVERED THE SAME DAY,(WANTED IT AS NEW YR GIFT).
      
      AS FAR AS PHONE IS CONCERNED, PERFORMANCE OF PHONE IS GOOD(NO HANG UPS/APP CRASHES)
      
      CONNECTS TO INTERNET FAST, ACCESS TO GOOGLE  PLAY IS GOOD.
      
      CAMERA(5 MP) IMAGES ARE GOOD WHEN TAKEN IN DAYLIGHT(WITHOUT FLASH), BUT IN NIGHT(USING FLASH), THOUGH IMAGES ARE CLEAR, LIGHT INTENSITY IS MORE IN IMAGES, I TRIES THE SETTINGS, BUT VERY FEW SETTINGS.
      
      ALSO VIDEO QUALITY AT NIGHT IS VERY POOR(EVEN WITH FLASH), DID'NT EXPECT SUCH POOR QUALITY FOR SUCH A PRICE RANGE AND SPECS,
      
      IMAGE QUALITY WAS VERY GOOD AND CRISP DURING DAYLIGHT, THATS THE ONLY PLUS IN PHOTOS.
      
      ALSO WHEN LISTENING TO CALLS, THE CALL SOUND WAS LOW, COMPARED TO OTHER BRANDS, EVEN MY OLDER SAMSUNG WAS GOOD IN IT,
      
      WHEN IN TRAFFIC, EVEN USING THE SPEAKER PHONE I WAS NOT ABLE TO CLEAR PROPERLY,
      
      ALSO AUDIO SOUND IS LESS AND RINGTONE SOUND IS LESS, EVEN AFTER INCREASING THE VOL TO MAX.
      
      ON THE WHOLE THE DEVICE IS WORTH OF MONEY, SINCE ITS ON JELLYBEAN, SCREENSIZE IS GOOD(4.3), BROWSING IS FAST AND EFFORTLESS, I DID'NT TRY GAMING SO CANT COMMENT ON IT
      
      (MY PREVIOUS DEVICE WAS IPHONE 4S, SO MAYBE I WENT ON IN COMPARISION, SO MIGHT BE ITS A GOODPICK FOR 12000-13000 RANGE)
      
      THANKS"
Galaxy Core,3,"I AM USING THIS MOBILE SINCE 6 MONTHS...THERE'S LOT OF NETWORK ISSUES AND ALSO CANT USE ""ACTIVE DUAL SIM"", LOW SOUND, IT HANGS FREQUENTLY. OVERALL RATING IS 3. DONT BUY!!!. GO FOR BIT HIGHER MOBILES."
Galaxy Core,3,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR THE LAST 1MONTH. I FOUND THERE I SOME PROBLEM OR DELAY IN THE DISPLAY, WHEN TOUCHING THE APPLICATION TAB. IT IS HAPPEND MORE WHEN I DOWNLOADED NEW APPLICATION FROM GOOGLE PLAY.TECHNICAL REASOMN MAY BE RAM OF 1GB. BECAUSE TODAYS APPLLICATIONS REQUIRED MORE RAM SPACE.CONCLUSION IS THAT U CANNOT DOWNLOADED MORE &AMP; MORE APPLICATION AND IF ESSENTIAL, THEN COMPROMISNG THE SPEED.
      
      OTHERWISE, OTHER FEATURES OF THE PHONE ARE VERY GOOD E.G.MUSIC PLAY, HD QUALITY,CAMERAS,DISPLAY QUALITY ETC.MEANS EVERY THING ARE GOOD AS EXPECTING FRO SMART PHONE.
      
      
      FOR EVERY NEW PURCHASER, THREE THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOR BUYING A PHONE:
      
      1) RAM (MORE IMPT.)
      
      2) PROCESSORE
      
      3) INTERNAL MEMORY.
      
      OTHERWISE ANDROID VERSION  IS ITSELF SUFFICIENT TO DO 1000'S OF APPLICATION USED/ REQUIRED TO HELP/ENTERTAIN IN OUR DAILY LIFE."
Galaxy Core,3,I BOUGHT ONE THIS SEPTEMBER. GOING GOOD SINCE THE PAST THREE MONTHS. NOTICED VERY FEW HANGING PROBLEMS. OVERALL A VERY NICE PHONE IN THIS RANGE. BUT SAMSUNG NEEDS TO FOCUS ON THE BATTERY PERFORMANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS. ALSO 2G INTERNET IS VERY SLOW.
Galaxy Core,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 1 MONTH BACK.THE APPS RUN SMOOTHLY NO PROBLEM IN THAT.BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR GAMING.I AM A GAMING FREAK AND I BOUGHT THIS PHONE THINKING THAT DUAL CORE 1.2 GHZ WILL GIVE NO LAGS.BUT SUBWAY SURFERS LAGS HEAVILY IN THIS PHONE.THE GRAPHICS IS ADRENO 203 WHICH IS THE LEAST SAMSUNG COULD PROVIDE.I AM DISSATISFIED BY THE GPU AND GAMING PERFORMANCE OF THIS PHONE OTHERWISE THE APPS RUN FINE.
      
      MUSIC QUALITY IS ALSO VERY GOOD.MULTITASKING MAY CAUSE IT TO LAG A BIT.
      
      AGAIN ITS A PERSONAL CHOICE.GO FOR THIS EYES CLOSED IF U WANT A PHONE FOR NORMAL USAGE AND NOT FOR GAMING."
Galaxy Core,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR REPLACING MY HTC EXPLORER. AS USUAL, GRT SERVICE BY FLIPKART (WS RETAILS), IT WAS DELIVERED WITHING 48 HRS IN CHENNAI.
      
      
      NOW ABT THE PHN. DISPLAY IS GOOD, PROCESSOR IS GOOD, CAN SUPPORT HEAVY GAMES WITHOUT ANY LAGS (I HAVE DOWNLOADED GAME SIZED UPTO 1.4 GB), METALLIC BLUE LOOKS PRETTY ELEGANT AND THE TEXTURED BACK PANEL ADD SOME MORE STARS TO ITS APPEARANCE. CAMERA IS DECENT AND U CAN CLICK DECENT PICS EVEN IN COMPLETE DARKNESS.
      
      
      NW ABT PROBLEMS WHICH I FELT AND FACED.
      
      BIGGEST PROBLEM IS OVERHEATING WHILE CHARGING AND PLAYING GAMES (EVN THE SMALLER GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN ETC, WHICH WAS WORKING FINE ON MY HTC EXPLORER)
      
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY POOR. INITIALLY WHEN I BOUGHT I HAVE TO CHARGE IT TWICE A DAY AS I WAS USING IT HEAVILY FOR DOWNLOADING AND TRYING DIFFERENT GAMES AND APPLICATIONS, BT NW SUM HW I'M MANAGING TO GET 18 HRS WITH NORMAL USAGE (15-20 MINS CALLS, 2 HRS MSGING, 2-3HRS WIFI, 1 HR MUSIC AND 1 HR GAME) ND BELIEVE ME I'VE TRIED ALL THE WAYS AND TYPES OF BATTERY SAVERS.
      
      
      TAKING ABOUT HEADSETS. INBOX HEADSETS ARE NT GOOD. I WAS EXPECTING IN EAR BT ITS A NORMAL ONE ND THT ALSO HAVING SUM AWKWARD KIND OF DESIGN BY WHICH MY EAR STARTS PAINING AFTR 10-15MINS. BT THANKS TO MY SKULKANDY HEADSETS WHICH I WAS USING FR MY PREVIOUS PHN IS WORKING GRT WITH THIS 1 AS WELL.
      
      
      720P VIDEO PLAYBACK IS NT SUPPORTED IN THE PHN, I'VE TRIED MANY APPS BT ALL GONE WASTE. VLC PLAYER WAS WORKING IT WAS GETTING STRUCK FREQUENTLY SO I UNINSTALLED IT.
      
      
      OVERALL THE PHN IS QUITE GOOD BT THE 1ST TWO PROBLEMS ARE UNACCEPTABLE AFTER SPENDING 13K.
      
      
      I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST NOT TO BUY THIS PHN IF NY ONE IS PLANNING."
Galaxy Core,3,"I CAN'T SAY THIS IS BEST MOBILE PHONE FOR SMART PHONE STARTERS, RATHER I WOULD SAY JUST ""GOOD"" DUE TO ITS BATTERY BACKUP ISSUE.
      
      
      WITH DUAL CORE PROCESSOR ITS PERFORMANCE VARIES WITH JUST BASIC APPLICATIONS (COME ALONG WITH PHONE) RUNNING ON THE PHONE.
      
      
      HAVING 1800MAH BATTERY, EVEN AFTER 100% CHARGE EVERY TIME, IT LASTS ONLY MAX 24HOURS WITH MINIMAL USABILITY."
Galaxy Core,3,"I DOES A VERY GOOD JOB OVERALL EXCEPT WEB BROWSING WHICH IS A HEADACHE IN THIS PHONE THE BROWSER IS LAGGY AND I COULD PLAY TEMPLE RUN 2 ,SUBWAY SURFERS AND DEAD TRIGGER WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM THE DISPLAY AND CAMERA IS DECENT .STILL TESTING THE BATTERY IT WAS ABLE TO GIVE 1 FULL DAY OF MODERATE USAGE"
Galaxy Core,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING IT QUITE SOME TIME NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THE THREE MOST ANNOYING DOWNS OF THIS PHONE
      
      1. AUDIO EVEN AT FULL VOLUME IS ON THE LOWER SIDE.
      
      2. BATTERY DRAINS OUT BEFORE THE END OF DAY IF I USE IT ON WI-FI/MOBILE DATA
      
      3. HANGS QUITE OFTEN
      
      4. AS YET COULD NOT FIND GOOD COMPATIBLE CALL RECORDER FOR IT"
Galaxy Core,3,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE LAST WEDNESDAY I.E. 31.07.2013. THE FIRST DAY OF PURCHASE WAS GONE EXPLORING THE VARIOUS FEATURES OF THE PHONE. THOUGH I AM NOT A TECH GEEK IN THE REAL SENSE OF THE TERM, YET I SAY THAT THIS PHONE IS SURELY OVERPRICED, GIVEN THE VARIETIES AVAILABLE TODAY. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IDEALLY PRICED BETWEEN RS. 13,000/= TO RS. 14,000/= GIVEN THE CONFIGURATION STANDARDS OF TODAY, OR EVEN A LITTLE LESS. ITS DISPLAY IS GOOD, AND THE SCREEN RESPOND TO TOUCHES WELL. INTERNET SURFING IS DECENT. I AM NOT AN AVID GAMER, BUT MOST OF THE GAMES CAN BE PLAYED WELL. ACCEPTS ALL KINDS OF MESSAGES AND CAN BE OPENED WITHOUT ANY GLITCHES. HOWEVER, ONE MAJOR NEGATIVE ASPECT IS WHAT I AM CONSTRAINED TO POINT OUT IS THAT FOR A MOBILE OF THIS CONFIGURATION, ONE 1800 MAH BATTERY? IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IDEALLY AT LEAST 2100MAH ONE. I FAIL TO APPRECIATE WHY SUCH MISERLY TREATMENT IN CASE OF BATTERY CONFIGURATION. MOST SMARTPHONES, ON ACCOUNT OF A LARGER SCREEN SPACE CONSUMES MORE BATTERY WITHIN A SHORT TIME. HENCE, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SYSTEMICALLY PROGRAMMED TO CONSUME LESS ENERGY AND, MOREOVER, THE HIGHER CONFIGURATION BATTERY SHOULD HAVE BEEN IDEALLY INSERTED, THIS SHOULD HAVE SOLVED MANY ISSUES WITH THIS MODEL. ALL THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS, I WOULD SUGGEST TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT BATTERY ISSUES OF THIS MOBILE. THE OTHER ASPECTS MIGHT BE OKAY. BUT BATTERY IS WOEFULLY WEAK, SINCE IT SUCKS ENERGY JUST LIKE PARCHED LANDS TAKE TO WATER. NO AMOUNT OF BATTERY DOCTORING HAVE HELPED. SO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS BATTERY ISSUES. OTHERWISE, IT HAS A DECENT DISPLAY, A DECENT INTERFACE, GOOD WORKABILITY, DECENT GAMING CAPABILITIES, EDITING DOCUMENTS, AND MISCELLANEOUS OFFICE WORK IS TRULY A BREEZE. BUT BEING LEFT IN THE LURCH, WITH MOBILE SWITCHED OFF DURING PEAK HOURS IN THE EVENING (SINCE AFTER WHOLE NIGHT OF CHARGING YOU HAVE GONE OUT FOR WORK AT 9 AM IN THE MORNING AND IS NOT SLATED TO RETURN BEFORE 9 PM AT LEAST, AND THE MOBILE HAS GONE OFF AT AROUND 6 PM AND YOU ARE NOT AMONGST THOSE WHO CARRIES A POWER BANK WITH YOU) IS SURELY A TURN OFF FACTOR. IT CLAIMS TO HAVE A BATTERY LIFE OF AROUND 9 HOURS, BUT FOR HEAVY USERS LIKE ME, THE FIRST DAY ITSELF, AFTER CHARGING THE BATTERY FULLY, I GOT NOT MORE THAN 3 HOURS. FOLKS, I MUST SAY THAT THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS AN ISSUE. LASTLY, THE LOOKS DEPARTMENT DISAPPOINTS. MY EARLY MOBILE WAS E-63, SO BEING USED TO USING A MOBILE PHONE WITH SUCH A SOLID BUILD QUALITY, THIS TYPE OF LOOKS SURELY SUCKS, POOR BLAND CHEAP PLASTIC, WITH A LITTLE GLOSSY LOOK. ONE ASPECT, SAMSUNG SHOULD CONSIDER GIVING THE FLIP COVER FOR FREE FOR ALL MODELS ABOVE RS. 14,000/= AND SHALL MAKE AVAILABLE FLIP COVERS FOR ALL SMARTPHONE MODELS COSTING LESS, WITH SUCH FLIP COVER BE SOLD AT A NOMINAL PRICE. SUCH FLIP COVERS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PROTECTING THE PHONE, SINCE THE SURFACE OF DISPLAY REQUIRES IT TO BE PROTECTED WITH CARE (MUCH MORE CARE IS NEEDED THAN YOU TAKE FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL, RATHER SIZZLINGLY BEAUTIFUL WIFE), SINCE NONE OF THESE MODELS COMES WITH GORILLA GLASS, AND, HENCE, SCRATCHES (NOTWITHSTANDING SCRATCH GUARD) WILL BE IMMINENT, SANS A SCREEN GUARD AND A FLIP COVER. SO FOLKS SINCE THE SAME IS NOT BEING SUPPLIED GRATIS, MAKE SURE YOU BUY, EVEN IF THE SAME IS OF A CHEAPER VARIETY, IT IS REQUIRED TO KEEP THE DISPLAY LIFE OF THE PHONE INTACT. 1GB RAM IS DECENT FOR A PHONE OF THIS CONFIGURATION. IN MY OPINION, THOSE WHO LOOK FOR FRILLS (THOUGH I DID NOT EXACTLY LOOKED FOR IT, FOR MY CHOICE OF LUMIA 720, BUT I MADE THE MISTAKE OF GOING FOR THE SLIGHT PRICE DIFFERENCE AND OPTED FOR THIS MODEL, I PERSONALLY DID NOT LIKE LUMIA 62, AND, HENCE THIS CHOICE), IN ADDITION TO UTILITY, THIS IS THE RIGHT PHONE, NOTWITHSTANDING THE WOEFUL BATTERY DEFICIENCY, BUT THOSE WHO LOOKS FOR QUALITY - BUILD QUALITY, SUPERIOR SOUND, AND STABLE PERFORMANCE EVEN AFTER YEARS OF USAGE (EVEN THOUGH USERS TODAY BUY MOBILE PHONES AT THE DROP OF A HAT), THESE SERIES OF PHONES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED. BUT THOSE WHO ARE FREQUENT BUYERS, TRY THIS ONE, THIS WILL AT LEAST NOT DISAPPOINT YOU AND SHALL KEEP YOU SUCKED WITH THE NOVELTY ELEMENTS AT LEAST TILL SIX MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE, UNLESS YOU ARE EXASPERATED WITH THE WOEFUL BATTERY. PLEASE DON'T TRY TO PLAY ONLINE GAMES AND NEVER GAMES WITH 3D INTERFACE, SINCE THIS WILL SLOW DOWN THE PHONE AND THE BATTERY WILL BE DISCHARGED WITHIN NO TIME, MAY BE WITHIN AN HOUR. SO FOLKS BE CAREFUL. ALSO THE DISPLAY GLASS IS NOT OF SUPERIOR BUILT, SO PLEASE TAKE CARE OF IT. I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW WITH LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF TECHNOLOGY, ON THE CONTRARY, THIS REVIEW SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS MORE OF AN USER'S REACTION TO SUCH DEVICE. I HAVE MERELY EXPRESSED MY OPINION BASED ON WHAT I HAVE FACED USING THIS MOBILE."
Galaxy Core,3,"I PURCHASED THIS MOBILE ON BEHALF OF REVIEWS ON THIS SITE, BUT I'M NOT SATISFIED.
      
      IT'S BATTERY IS BAD CAN'T TAKE TOLL OF 3G NET, AND I'M NOT SAYING TO RUN NET WHOLE DAY, IF WE KEEP MOBILE DATA ON THEN ALSO BATTERY CONSUMPTION IS VERY HIGH.
      
      ITS PROCESSOR IS NOT GOOD WITH 1.2GHZ ALSO AS GAMES STARTS HANGING FREQUENTLY.
      
      ALL OTHER FEATURES ARE GOOD, I WILL SUGGEST IT TO THOSE WHO DON'T USE PHONE RIGOURSLY."
Galaxy Core,3,"I SEE IN BUILT MEMORY AS 8GB IN SPECIFICATION, BUT I GET ONLY 4.7GB. ALSO DON'T HAVE GOOD CONTROLS IN SUBWAY SURFERS."
Galaxy Core,3,"I WAITED A MONTH BEFORE GIVING THE REVIEW. HERE'S MY TAKE ON THIS:
      
      PROS:
      
      1. EXCELLENT LOOKS, NICE FEEL ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT A HUGE SCREEN SMARTPHONE.
      
      2. NICE &AMP; EASY TO USE OS WITH ALL THE APPS YOU CAN THINK OF &AMP; NEED.
      
      3. NICE VIDEO RESOLUTION &AMP; SOUND.
      
      4. NICE BUTTONS ACCESSIBILITY.
      
      5. SATISFACTORY FRONT &AMP; BACK CAMERA WITH FLASH FOR BACK.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. BATTERY HEAT UP &AMP; VERY HIGH EXHAUSTION RATE.
      
      2. SOMETIMES HANGS.
      
      3. WITH THE SAME PRICE BRACKET NOW MOTO G IS A COMPARABLE OPTION WITH KITKAT OS
      
      4. ORIGINAL SAMSUNG CASE SUCKS.
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT: HAD MOTO G BEEN AVL WHEN I WAS BUYING THIS PHONE, I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT. GO FOR IT ONLY IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR SAMSUNG BRAND VALUE AT THIS PRICE RANGE."
Galaxy Core,3,"I WAS LOOKING FOR DUAL SIM AND 4-4'3"" SCREEN FOUND M DUAL AND CORE , AT THE TIME I BOOKED CORE WAS ABOUT 2K CHEAPER AND HAD 8GB OF INTERNAL COMPARATIVE TO M, BUT LOOKING TOWARD CAMERA ,BUILT AND HARDWARE I FIND M HAS BETTER AND ALSO M FIT AND FINISH IS BETTER,
      
      AND EVERYONE KNW THAT SAMSUNG IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE , GO FOR IT IF UR A FANBOY !!"
Galaxy Core,3,"I?V BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR OVER A MONTH. NO COMPLAINTS WITH FLIPKART DELIVERY. I BOUGHT IT FOR ITS LARGE SCREEN SIZE &AMP; REASONABLE PRICE.
      
      HOWEVER, THIS ISN?T A FLAWLESS PHONE. BATTERY DRAINS QUICKLY ON INTERNET USAGE AND THE LOUDSPEAKER SOUND IS ON THE LOWER SIDE. ALSO, THE BACK PANEL SEEMS TOO FRAGILE &AMP; IT?S ADVISABLE TO REPLACE IT WITH A FLIP COVER.
      
      YET ITS A GOOD DEAL &AMP; WORTH THE MONEY."
Galaxy Core,3,"IF U ACTIVATE 3G ON ROAMING SIM, THE MOBILE RESTARTING INSTANTLY.

      GO FOR SONY"
Galaxy Core,3,IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR BIGGER SCREEN AND LOUSY ANDROID OS GO FOR THIS PRODUCT. THERE ARE LOTS OF ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE IN MARKET. SAMSUNG AFTER SALES SERVICE IS GOOD AND ACCESSORIES ARE EASILY AVAILABLE IN MARKET OR ON INTERNET.
Galaxy Core,3,"IT IS TOO MUCH EXPENSIVE ,IN THAT MUCH PRICE YOU CAN BUY CANVAS 4 WHICH IS HAVING 13MP PRIMARY &AMP; 3.2 SECONDARY CAMERA,2GB RAM , 2GZ PROCESSOR AND MOST INTERESTING FEATURE IS A 5.5 FULL HD SCREEN LOADED WITH OS ANDROID JB."
Galaxy Core,3,"ITS A DECENT PRODUCT....USER MEMORY IN BROCHURE SAYS 8 GB BUT AVAILABLE IS ONLY 4.75 GB.
      
      I SAY GO FOR MOTO G RATHER THAN BUYING THIS!"
Galaxy Core,3,ITS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR THIS COST. BUT ONLY DISADVANTAGE IS BATTERY BACK UP. ITS IS LITTLE POOR ONLY.
Galaxy Core,3,"ITS BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY LOW. I THOUGHT 1800 MAH WILL GOOD BT ITS NOT. I CHARGE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. ITS ALL FEATURES ARE GOOD BUT ONLY BATTERY , I DON,T EXPECT THAT. I M FEELING SO BAD AFTER PURCHASE IT. IF YOU WANT LONG BATTERY LIFE DON,T BUY IT."
Galaxy Core,3,"ITS THE BEST. 1GB RAM, 8GB INTERNAL MEMORY(4.7GB USER,3.3GB SYSTEM),5MP CAMERA(OF A VERY RELIABLE BRAND I.E SAMSUNG),4.3 INCH DISPLAY(VERY STANDARDIZED SIZE TO FIT IN YOUR POCKET,CARRY,TALK ETC).BUT BATTERY IS A MATTER OF CONCERN,HOWEVER IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT INTELLIGENTLY YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE MUCH FRETS AND FUMES ON THIS ASPECT.OVERALL THE BEST PRODUCT AND FAR BETTER THAN ITS COMPETITORS SONY,HTC ETC."

Galaxy Core,3,SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE I8262 WAS OFFERING THE BEST CONFIGURATION AT A PRICE RANGE OF 12K. I DID A LOT OF MARKET RESEARCH BEFORE FINALLY SETTLING FOR THIS ONE. IT WAS SURLY THE BEST CHOICE JUST A MONTH BACK UNTIL MOTO G ARRIVED.

      CPU: CORTEX A5
      
      
      ONLY GOOD THING IS DISPLAY SIZE IS VERY HANDY AND 8 GB INTERNAL MEMORY. SONY XPERIA M WOULD BE BIGGEST COMPETITOR. SONY IS OFFERING LATEST H/W WITH SAME PRICE.
      
      
      WAIT FOR 2 MONTHS, IT WOULD BE IN ARROUND RS. 12,000/- ."
Galaxy Core,3,"WELL HERE IS YOUR SOLUTION..AFTER READING THIS U CAN ANSWER YOUR MENTAL DELIBERATIONS ABOUT THESE PHONES..!!COZ M USING BOTH NOW..!!
      
      IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR USAGE N WHAT U  LIKE?U CANT HAVE ALL THE FEATURES ON ONE PHONE..BOTH HAVE DIFFERENT DISTINGUISHED FEATURES..!
      
      1.IN SONY U CAN PLAY HEAVY GAMES BUT U DONT HAVE SPACE TO INSTALL ANYTHING ON IT(1.6GB).E.G NFS,REAL RACING,FIFA 14.(M NOT TALKING ABOUT ROOTING YOUR PHONES HERE)
      
      2.IN SAMSUNG U CANT PLAY VERY HEAVY GAMES BUT LIGHT OR MEDIUM GAMES LIKE SUBWAY,TEMPLE RUN ETC.MORE HEAVIER THE GAME IS THE FASTER IT GETS HEATED..!
      
      3.CAMERA SAMSUNG(AWSOME) &GT;SONY.
      
      4.VIDEO RECORDING SONY(AWSOME)&GT;SAMSUNG(OKOK)..
      
      5.VIDEO PLAYER:SONY(GOOD)&GT;SAMSUNG(NOT MORE THAN 600*800)
      
      6.SCREEN SIZE: SAMSUNG 4.3(PERFECT)&GT;SONY(HAVE TO COMPROMISE,VERY SMALL (3.8)
      
      7.PERFORMANCE WISE BOTH ARE ALMOST EQUAL..
      
      8.DISPLAY ALSO ALMOST EQUAL..
      
      9.LOOKS:SAMSUNG-OLD CONVENTIONAL STYLE N SONY IS LIKE MY A.C REMOTE
      
      BUT OVERALLY I WOULD SUGGEST U SAMSUNG..COZ I PLAY HEAVY GAMES IN MY LAPPY AND PC
      
      NOT IN PHONE.IN PHONE I JUST PLAY SOME GAMES TO PASS SOME TIME TO SITUATIONS.NEED NOT BE VERY HEAVY.ATLEAST I CAN INSTALL SOME APPS FOR GENERAL USE HAPPILY."
Galaxy Core,3,"WORKING FINE. BIT SLUGGISH , SOME TIMES RESTARTS AUTOMATICALLY. SCREEN STUCKS SOME TIMES FOR FEW SECONDS. MAY BE DEFAULT PROB WITH ANDROID. BUT GOOD PACKAGE IN THIS PRICE."
Galaxy Core,2,"13240 FOR AN DUAL CORE CORTEX A5 CHIPSET &AMP; ADRENO 203 GPU??? TOO MUCH. HUAWEI Y300 HAS IT EXCEPT 1GB RAM &AMP; DUAL SIM OPTION WHICH COMES @7.5K
      
      
      UNDER 13K BUDGET  IF DUAL SIM NOT REQUIRED SAMSUNG S ADVANCE COULD BE SOURCED.
      
      OR
      
      AROUND 12.5K GET SONY XPERIA M[DUAL CORE KRAIT ] WHICH IS VERY POWERFUL.
      
      
      AT 14.5K YOU CAN GET SONY XPERIA M DUAL[DUAL CORE KRAIT] WITH DUAL SIM.

Galaxy Core,2,EAR PHONE IS BAD BAD QUALITY IT WILL NOT FIT IN THE EAR. MY FRIENDS PURCHASED OUT SIDE OF FLIPKART THEY GOT GOOD EARPHONE IT WILL FIT IN EAR.
Galaxy Core,2,"FIRST OF ALL I AM VERYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY MUCH HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE OF FLIPKART.....YOU PEOPLE SHOULD MANUFACTURE YOUR OWN PRODUCT!!!
      
      
      ABOUT PHONE.................
      
      I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST 15 DAYS...THE PHONE HAS 1.2 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR COUPLED WITH ADRENO 203 GRAPHICS UNIT &AMP; 1GB RAM WHICH LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER, BUT NOT AT ALL GOOD IN REAL SCENARIO . I AM VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED WHEN I SEE MY FRIEND IS PLAYING SUBWAY SURFERS/ TEMPLE RUNNER FLAWLESSLY WITH HIS I-BALL..COULD U IMAGINE ..ITS I-BALL WITH 512 MB OF RAM AND MY CORE IS STRUGGLING SO MUCH WITH 1 GB OF RAM TO PLAY THE SAME GAME FLAWLESSLY.
      
      
      ANOTHER PROBLEM I AM FACING IS GETS HEATED UP VERY QUICKLY EVEN AFTER WATCHING VIDEO FOR A SHORT TIME (5-10 MINUTES)
      
      
      ONLY CAMERA AND DISPLAY ARE PRETTY GOOD....SO SORRY NOT RECOMANDED"
Galaxy Core,2,"HEY ITS A TRUE REVIEW.. LOOK WISE ITS GOOD BUT FUNTIONALITY WISE ITS NOT BETTER MOBILE..
      
      
      I HAVE USED IT FOR ONE MONTH , AFTER 20 DAYS I FACED HEATING PROBLEM WHEN PLAYED GAMES FOR LONGER TIME (30MINS OR 45 MINS PLUS) AND WHILE GAMING ITS BATTERY LASTS VERY FAST
      
      
      ITS GETTING STRUCT AFTER USAGE OF 20 DAYS.. FIRST TIME I THOUGHT IT MAY HANG FOR 1MIN BUT IT KEEP ON HANGING REGULARLY TRICE A DAY.. ITS GETTING RESTART OR FORCIBLY WE HAVE TO RESTART IT TO GET IT WORK AGAIN..
      
      
      BUT ITS WITH THE PEICE WHICH WE GET.. NOT ALL CORE PHONES ARE LIKE THIS BUT 60-70% ARE GETTING THIS PROBLEM...
      
      
      BETTER GO FOR SOME OTHER MOBILE..
      
      
      BUT IF U THINK U HAVE LUCK AND THINK U WILL GET GOOD PIECE OF CORE MOBILE THEN GO FOT IT AND CHECK UR LUCK"
Galaxy Core,2,HI I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER USING MICROMAX CANVAS DOODLE. THIS PHONE IN NOWHERE IN COMPARISON TO THAT. IT HANGS WHILE PLAYING SUBWAY SURFER OR OTHER HIGH GRAPHICS GAME.
Galaxy Core,2,"I AM IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING A SMARTPHONE. MY BUDGET IS AROUND 12-13K. MY SEARCH ENDED WITH FEW OPTIONS AND ONE AMONG IT IS THIS PHONE.
      
      
      I WENT TO THE LOCAL STORE TO SEE HOW IT LOOKS PHYSICALLY IN THE HAND. AND I WOULD SAY THAT IT LOOKS VERY GOOD. PLUS ITS LIGHT WEIGHT AND VERY THIN. PLAYED WITH IT TO SEE THE TOUCH RESPONSE. IT WAS OK, NOT THAT GREAT.
      
      
      I AM HAVING THIS IN THE LIST AND WILL BE MAKING A PURCHASE THIS DIWALI (WAITING FOR OFFERS :) )
      
      
      BUT THEN I SAW LG NEXUS 4. THIS PHONE HAS DEADLY SPECS. 2GB RAM, GORILLA GLASS, 1.5 GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR. ITS PRICE IS AROUND 20K NOW.
      
      
      BUT LOOKS LIKE NEXUS 5 IS ROUND THE CORNER. WITH ITS RELEASE THE PRICE MIGHT DROP AT LEAST IN USA. IF NEXUS 4 IS AVAILABLE AT AROUND 14K, THEN I WANT NOT GIVE ANY SECOND THOUGHTS.
      
      
      ALSO I FOUND NOKIA LUMIA 520, INTERESTING. ITS GOOD AND FLOWS SEAMLESSLY, WINDOWS 8 IS REFRESHING. ALSO FOUND AND AWESOME DEAL FOR THIS ON WWW.ZORDAAR.COM. PHONE WAS AVAILABLE FOR RS. 7790/- ONLY"
Galaxy Core,2,"I BROUGHT THIS MOBILE 2 MONTHS BACK.
      
      PROS : 5 MP CAMERA-- REALLY VERY EXCELLENT.
      
      * INTERNAL MEMORY-- NEARLY 5GB.
      
      * 4.3 INCHES DISPLAY.
      
      * WHEN I WAS PLAYING OR USING THIS MOBILE EVEN A SINGLE TIME ALSO IT DIDN'T GOT STRUCK OR HANG.( THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF THIS MOBILE)
      
      * VIDEO CUTTER.-- WE CAN TRIM THE VIDEO AND WE CAN CUT THE VIDEOS AS PHOTOS. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEATURE I LIKE IN THIS MOBILE.
      
      
      CONS : THE ONLY REASON FOR GIVING 2 * RATING BCZ, WHILE I WAS USING INTERNET "" IT IS RESTARTED ITSELF"" THIS IS MAIN DRAWBACK.
      
      WITHIN 2 DAYS IT RESTARTED NEARLY 15-20 TIMES. AFTER THAT I GAVE IT TO SERVICE CENTER. THEY SAID THAT "" IT IS MANUFACTURING DEFECT. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE MOTHER BOARD"".
      
      AFTER REPLACING THE MOTHER BOARD ALSO I GOT THAT SAME PROBLEM. AGAIN I GAVE IT TO THE SERVICE CENTER. BUT  NOW THEY DIDNT KNOW WHY IT WAS RESTARTED ITSELF. AND AGAIN THEY SAID THAT"" WE ARE USING YOUR MOBILE NEARLY 2 HOURS. BUT IT DIDN'T RESTARTED"" LIKE THAT THEY SAID. SO I ASKED THEM TO CHANGE THE PIECE. BUT I AM WAITING FOR THEIR REPLY.
      
      
      SO ACCORDING TO MY VIEW. THIS IS VERY GOOD PHONE. BUT ACCEPT THAT RESTARTING PROBLEM. AND ALSO I HEARD THAT FOR "" GALAXY CORE"" MOBILES THIS IS SAME PROBLEM FOR EVERY ONE WHO IS USING THIS. EXCEPT THE PIECE WHICH IS MANUFACTURED IN WITH NAME CALLED "" UNITED....""(SOME THING IS THERE. I DONT KNOW EXACTLY. BUT STARTED WITH UNITED ONLY) IS WORKING FINE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM......
      
      
      SO PLEASE THINK ONCE AGAIN WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS CORE......"
Galaxy Core,2,I GOT THIS PHONE FROM A LOCAL SAMSUNG DEALER AND NOT FROM FLIPKART. AFTER USING IT FOR ALMOST 3 MONTHS I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW. WELL THERE IS NOTHING GREAT ABOUT THIS PHONE EVEN THE PROCESSOR IS 1GHZ AND THE RAM IS 1 GB THIS PHONE CANT EVEN PLAY THE NORMAL GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN AND OTHER. I DONT KNOW WHAT THESE SAMSUNG PEOPLE THINK ABOUT INDIANS. EVERY DAY THEY COME UP WITH A NEW MODEL WITH A MINUTE UPGRADATION OF THE PREVIOUS MODEL. WELL THERE IS NO COMPLAINT ABOUT FLIPKART BUT FOR THIS PHONE I WILL GIVE ONLY 2 STARS.... HOPE THIS HELPS THE NEW BUYER.
Galaxy Core,2,ITS A GOOD PHONE WITHIN THE MEDIUM BUDGET AND THE CAMERA IS GOOD WHEN IM TAKING PICTURE N SEEIN IT IN PHONE BUT WHEN I TRANSFERRED IT TO PC/LAPTOP ITS LOOK DALL.
Galaxy Core,2,"MOST 3RD CLASS CAMERA &AMP; BATTERY, ALSO NOT SUPPORT AVI &AMP; WMV VIDEO FILE. IF WANT TO PURCHASE SAMSUNG GALAXY BETTER TO GO FOR GALAXY S DUOS @ 9500/- OR GO FOR GALAXY GRAND QUATTRO @ 16500/- (QUATTRO SUPPORT AVI &AMP; WMV VIDEO FILE)"
Galaxy Core,2,"MY SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE I8262... WITHIN 2 WEEKS..THE SPEAKER DOES NOT WORK AND THE MIKE DOES NOT WORK, N NO I DIDN'T DROP IT.
      
      I CAN HEAR RINGTONE BUT I CANT HEAR MUSIC FROM THE CELL. I CAN HEAR THE VOICE OF CALLING PARTY ONLY IF I PUT IT ON SPEAKERS, OTHERWISE THE SOUND DOES NOT COME. I CAN TALK ONLY IF I CAN USE MY SPEAKER PHONE..OR ELSE THE OTHER PARTY CANT HEAR MY VOICE.
      
      
      GIVEN FOR REPAIRS, IT WILL TAKE 3 DAYS FOR THE PART TO ARRIVE...CANT BELIEVE THE QUALITY CAN BE SO POOR OF SAMSUNG CELL PHONES.
      
      
      I REALLY WANT SAMSUNG TO REPLACE THE PIECE WHAT DO I DO?"
Galaxy Core,2,"NO MENTIONING OF DEDICATED GPU.
      
      MOREOVER PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE/MODEL NOT SPECIFIED. SO CANT TELL IF IT IS BETTER THAN QUATTRO, AS THE PROCESSOR IN QUATTRO IS OF MY GRANDPA'S AGE.
      
      BUT XPERIA L IS CLOSE IN PRICING, BUT THERE IS NO COMPARISON AS XPREI L EXCEEDS IN EVERYTHING (VIDEO 720P, GPU ADRENO 305 [WOW], 8MP CAM, KRAIT PROCESSOR WHICH IS JUST AWESOME).
      
      LET US AIT FOR THE BENCHMARKS."
Galaxy Core,2,"NOKIA LUMIA IS GOOD PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE: HTML, REFERENCES TO OTHER RETAILERS, PRICING, PERSONAL INFORMATION, ANY PROFANE, INFLAMMATORY OR COPYRIGHTED COMMENTS, OR ANY COPIED CONTENT"
Galaxy Core,2,"OVERALL ITS GOOD IN PRICE RANGE. BUT BATTERY LIFE IS VERY POOR, I AM USING IT SINCE 15 DAYS AND CHARGING TRICE A DAY.. IT LASTS FOR MAX 6 HOURS EVEN NETWORK IS OFF, IN BEST BATTERY SAVING MODE. FLIPKART DELIVERY IS GOOD, BUT THEY HAVE TO CHECK THE AVAILABILITY OF THE CUSTOMER ON SAT SUNDAYS."
Galaxy Core,2,"PLEASEE....
      
      ANY CORE USER CAN CHECK IF VIDEO RECORDING CAN BE PAUSED AND RESUMED, OR IS IT ONLY STOP-START(MEANS VIDEO CLIPS IN BITS AND PIECES). PLS RESPOND URGENTLY I WANNA BUY THIS PHONE TOMORROW. IF CORE DOESNT HAVE THIS FACILITY, DOES ANY OTHER GALAXY SERIES PHONE COSTING AROUND RS. 15000 HAS THIS ? THANKS IN ADVANCE"
Galaxy Core,2,"PURCHASED THE GALAXY CORE I8262 MOBILE THROUGH FLIPKART. BUT FROM THE DAY ONE IT WAS GETTING RESTARTED AUTOMATICALLY WHILE USING DUAL SIM. I WAS SUSPECTING SIM WHICH WAS CUT INTO MICRO SIM CARD. SO BOUGHT NEW SIM CARD FROM CUSTOMER CENTRE &AMP; STILL THE SAME ISSUE IS CONTINUING. SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO NOW, AS I'M IN COMPLETE DILEMMA &AMP; HEART BREAK."
Galaxy Core,2,RECENTLY BOUGHT ONE PIECE AND REGRET TO HAVE DONE SO AS IT RESTARTS ON ITS OWN. GAVE IT TWICE TO THE SERVICE CENTER OF SAMSUNG AND STILL FACING THE SAME PROBLEM. WAS ASKED TO GET THE MOTHER BOARD CHANGED. I AM VERY UPSET AS THIS IS MY FIRST SMART PHONE AND AFTER GOING THROUGH THE REVIEWS I BOUGHT IT. HOPE I GET A REPLACEMENT AS I DONT WANT ANY PART CHANGE IN MY PHONE BEFORE I EVEN COULD UNDERSTAND ITS BASIC APPLICATION.
Galaxy Core,2,"THE PRODUCT IS GOOD BUT THE DELIVERY IS TURNING BAD TO WORSE, ORDERED THIS ITEM ON 15 AUG 2013, TILL 23 AUG NO DELIVERY BY COURIER PARTNER, SO CANCELLED THE DELIVERY AS IT WAS FRUSTRATING TO RECEIVE A GIFT AFTER THE OCCASION HAS PASSED.
      
      
      TILL DATE 26TH AUG NO RESPONSE FROM FLIPKART TEAM FOR REFUND OF MY AMOUNT..FLIPKART IT TURNING TO BE FLOPKART..MAY GOD BLESS THEM"
Galaxy Core,2,THE SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE DUOS MOBILE IS A GOOD MOBILE WITH VERY GOOD FEATURES. BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THE MOBILE IS ITS BATTERY LIFE NEEDS TO BE CHARGED 2 TIMES A DAY. SO THEW BATTERY LIFE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED.

      SAMSUNG SHOULD GIVE 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY IN THESE NEW PHONES   NO NFC NO USB OTG IN NEW MODELS ALSO
      
      SO SAMSUNG IMPROVEMENT IS ZERO IN THE NEW MODELS AND ALSO LOOK AT THE PRICE DIFFERENCE IN S ADVANCE &AMP; ACE3 &AMP; CORE
      
      
      SAMSUNG YOU SHOULD IMPROVE. ALSO THE BUILD QUALITY IT ALWAYS HAVE BEEN CHEAP IN ANY GALAXY MODEL EVEN IN THE FLAGSHIP S4 PLEASE IMPROVE BUILD QUALITY OF YOUR PHONES. ALSO CHANGE THE DESIGN DONT GIVE ALL THE PHONES SAME DESIGN.
      
      
      HOPE THAT WE WILL GET BETTER BUILD QUALITY &AMP; BETTER HARDWARE &AMP; DISPLAY IN YOUR NEW PHONES"
Galaxy Core,2,"WITH PLENTY OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET TODAY IMO U  SHOULD THINK OF SPENDING FEW EXTRA BUCKS AND GET A GOOD PHONE. I BOUGHT THIS ONE LAST YEAR JULY, JUST AFTER LAUNCH WITH INR 14K AND GOT VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE.
      
      I'VE STARTED USING SMARTPHONE FROM 2010 WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY BOUGHT FROM UK AND USED IT FOR 1 YEAR BEFORE I BOUGHT HTC WILDFIRE S, WHICH IS THE BEST PHONE I USED EVER. THEN MICROMAX, GALAXY CORE AND NOW HANDED OVER THAT ONE TO MY WIFE DUE TO ITS NUMEROUS PROBLEMS AND BOUGHT A LENOVO A706 WITH TIGHT BUDGET.
      
      
      PROS: 1) GOOD TOUCH SCREEN, HTC, APPLE AND SAMSUNG ARE THE BEST IN CLASS IMO.
      
      2) LOOKS GREAT AND EXPENSIVE ONE
      
      3) NICE CAMERA
      
      
      CONS: 1) HUGE NETWORK PROBLEM. SOMETIMES NETWORK GOES OFF WITH ""NO CONNECTION"" AND WITHOUT INFORMING THE USER FOR A LONG AND EVENTUALLY U CAN MISS IMPORTANT MEETINGS. THIS IS HAPPENING WITH VODAFONE CONNECTION IN CALCUTTA..!! TRIED WITH 2 SIMS..!!
      
      2) SOMETIME WHEN I WANTED TO CALL ITS SAYING NO NETWORK AVAILABLE IN CENTRAL CALCUTTA WITH VODAFONE NETWORK AND I NEED TO AGAIN SELECT THE NETWORK CONNECTION AS AUTOMATIC OR SP.
      
      3) POOR BATTERY LIFE
      
      4) HANGS QUITE A WHILE
      
      
      OVERALL: VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PHONE AND HANDED OVER TO MY WIFE WHILE I'M TRYING WITH LENOVO NOW."

Galaxy Core,1,"HELLO EVERYONE. I HAVE PURCHASED A NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE BASED ON ITS CONFIGURATION AND FEW GOOD REVIEWS. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THAT I MADE. HONESTLY SPEAKING THIS PHONE SUCKS. PLEASE DO CONSIDER THIS AS A PERSONAL ADVICE ""DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE"" THE PRICE MIGHT LOOK ALRIGHT FOR THE CONFIGURATION BUT THE PHONE LAGS ALOT AND HANGS LIKE CRAZY. I HAVE COMPARED MY PHONE WITH FEW OF MY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHO HAS MICROMAX CANVAS AN I BALL AND A CHEAPER VERSION OF SAMSUNG PHONES ITSELF AND REALIZED THAT THEY PERFORM WAY BETTER THAN THIS PHONE. I PICKED THIS PHONE THINKING THAT IF THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS HIGH THE PHONE WONT LAG WHICH IS BULLSHIT. MY FRIEND WHO HAS A MICROMAX CANVAS HAS ONLY 2GB OF INTERNAL MEMORY ON HIS PHONE AND HAS MUCH MORE APPS ON HIS PHONE THAN I DO AND IT WORKS FASTER. WHEN I SPEAK ABOUT LAGGING I MEAN THAT THERE IS A DELAY WHEN OPENING APPLICATIONS AND GAMES, CONTACTS ETC. I THOUGHT THAT I WAS JUST THE UNFORTUNATE ONE BUT WHEN I CHECKED A DISPLAY PIECE AT CROMA KORAMANGLA, BANGALORE IT DID EXACTLY THE SAME AFTER WHICH I REALISED THAT THIS PHONE ITSELF WAS SHIT. I AM SORRY TO ALL THE PHONE CRITICS FOR THIS PHONE THAT I DID NOT LISTEN TO YOU'LL AND WENT AHEAD AND GOT THIS PHONE. IF ANY ONE IS INTERESTED IN BUYING THIS PHONE I HAVE A WEEK OLD PHONE AND AM WILLING TO SELL THIS FOR 1000 BUCKS LESSER THAN WHAT IT IS BEING SOLD AT HERE.
      
      MEAN WHILE IF ANY ONE HAS A FIX TO THIS ISSUE I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD LET US KNOW IT WOULD MAKE LIFE EASY FOR ALL THE UNFORTUNATE BUYERS LIKE ME."

      IT GETS HANGED AND SOMETIME IT WORKS FINE,
      
      
      THE ERROR MESSAGE IS ALWAYS ON YOU DISPLAY...
      
      
      AND IT HAS ALL THE FEATURE BUT ITS MISSES TO BE A PHONE"
Galaxy Core,1,HI DONOT BUY THIS MODEL. IT SHOW ALWAYS NO NETWORK ALWAYS NEED TO RESTART THE MOBILE. I TOOK IT IN 2 WEEKS BACK WHEN IT WAS. I THINK FOR THE SAME REASON SAMSUNG REDUCED THE PRICE 12313215645645644444444444444444444
Galaxy Core,1,"HI GUYS I RECOMMEND NO TO BUY THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF THE MAIN TWO DISADVANTAGES IN IT
      
      
      1.FREQUENT RESTARTING OF THE MOBILE
      
      
      2.IT IS GETTING HEATED UP VERY QUICKLY WHILE PLAYING THE GAME
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE ONE WEEK BACK BY SEEING ITS SPECIFICATIONS BUT I AM REGRETTING NOW FOR BUYING THIS MOBILE FOR 13250.......................
      
      I THINK THIS MOBILE IS NOT COST WORTHY......................."
Galaxy Core,1,"HI..I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION HERE THAT I BOUGHT THIS PHONE JUST 3 DAYS BEFORE..AS I WAS PLANNING TO BUY XPERIA L..BUT AS I COMPARED FEATURES AND PRICE...I WAS THINKING BIT A DIFFERENCE SO WHY SHOULD I SPEND MORE MONEY ON XPERIA L..(WHICH WAS MY BIGGEST MISTAKE)...SO I BOUGHT THIS PHONE @14500 FROM MARKET..AND THE SAME DAY WHEN I CHECKED IT HERE IT WAS 12900...SO I LOST AROUND RS1500 ALSO...
      
      
      PHONE HANG EVERY NOW AND THEN,,,WHEN I USE WE CHAT AND WHATSAPP..AND TRYING TO CLICK A  PIC AND SHARE..CAMERA NOT WORKING MEANS NOT OPENING AND SHOWING SOME CAMERA ERROR..
      
      
      WHEN AM DIALLING ANY NUMBER ..IT WONT WORK..THEN I HAVE TO RESTART IT..THEN IT WLL WORK PROPERLY FOR A WHILE..YAHOO MSGER HANGED ALWAYS...
      
      
      ALL APPLICATIONS DOWNLOAD IN ITS INTERNAL MEMORY AND IT CANNOT BE TRANSFEERABLE TO EXTERNAL STORAGE..SO NO USE OF EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD..
      
      
      BIGGEST DRAWBACK IS ITS CAMERA HANGING AND DAILING NOT WORKING PROPERLY...
      
      SO AM NOT RECOMMENDING IT TO BUY.."
Galaxy Core,1,I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 1 MONTH BACK . IN 1 MONTH PERIOD IT WENT TO SERVICE CENTER TWICE. AND ITS INTERNAL PARTS ARE VERY CHEAP AND DELICATE. ITS CHARGING PORT CRASHES EASILY AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY 650 RS. I AM REALLY DEPRESSED WITH SAMSUNG FOR THIS PHONE
Galaxy Core,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 3 MONTHS AGO, AND NOW I AM LOOKING TO SELL IT.
      
      
      REASONS FOR SELLING:
      
      1. CRAPPY BATTERY LIFE - NEEDS CHARGING TWICE A DAY.
      
      2. LAGS A LOT, EVEN NORMAL THINGS ARE NOT FLUID.
      
      3. EVEN WHILE MAKING CALLS, IT IS SLOW AND TAKES A SOLID 4-5 SECONDS TO OPEN EVEN THE DIALER.
      
      4. HD VIDEOS ARE NOT PLAYED SMOOTHLY, EVEN 720P LAGS AND THINGS GO OUT OF SYNC. DONT EVEN TALK ABOUT FULL HD. RECORDS TOO IN 480P.
      
      5. SCREEN ALMOST BLACKS OUT IN SUNLIGHT, EVEN AT FULL BRIGHTNESS YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE HARD TO READ CLEARLY.
      
      
      REASONS TO BUY THIS PHONE:
      
      1. SCREEN IS GOOD, COLORS ARE ACCURATE, BUT SUNLIGHT VISIBILITY IS NOT GOOD AT ALL.
      
      2. DUAL SIM, DUAL ACTIVE."
Galaxy Core,1,"I GOT IT IN RS 13000 WITH FLIP COVER AND SCREEN GUARD.BATTERY BACKUP IS TOO LOW THATS WHY WE RECALL NOKIA.HOW CN ANY1 ENJOY AN ANDROID PHONE WITH ONLY 5-6 HRS BATTERY BACKUP ????? SAMSUNG CLAIMS ON ITS WEBSITE THAT IT'LL LAST IN 9 HRS WHILE USING 3G,ACTUALLY USING ONLY 2G,BATTERY SAVING APP,POWER SAVING MODE IT LASTS IN 5-6 HRS ONLY. WILL THIS FALSE/CHEATING CLAIM CAN MAKE SAMSUNG A TRUSTED COMPANY ????   IN MY VIEW CHINESE COMPANIES,BETTER CLAIMS 5-6 HRS BACKUP AND GIVES MORE THAN THIS."
Galaxy Core,1,"I HAD PURCHASED SAMSUNG GALAXY S 1.5 YEARS BACK. TILL 2 MONTHS IT WORKED FINE. BUT IT HAD A PROBLEM, WHEN I CONTACTED SAMSUNG SSERVICE CENTRE THEY TOLD THAT THE MOTHER BORAD NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, AND IT COSTS RS6000 WITH OUT WARRANTY. SO WITH RS.19000 I PURCHASED A MOBILE WHICH WORKS FOR 1.5 YEARS. SAMSUNG GALAXY PHONES WITH POOR QUALITY..."
Galaxy Core,1,"I HAVE ORDERED ONE SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE I 8262 AND FLIP COVER FOR SAME FROM FLIPKART, I PAID IN ADVANCE AND WAITED FOR A LONG TO PRODUCT DISPATCH AT MY PLACE.
      
      
      I SURPRISED AFTER RECEIVING PRODUCTS, FLIP COVER WHICH WAS RECOMMENDED BY FLIPKART (BASED ON RECOMMENDATION ONLY I PUT MY ORDER) NOT AT ALL SUITS TO SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE I 8262, IT IS LIKE PROVIDING A SMALL DRESS TO AN ELEPHANT...
      
      
      I HAVE SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THIS:
      
      
      1.WHY FLIPKART RECOMMENDED PRODUCT TO CUSTOMERS, WHICH IS NOT AT ALL SUIT TO THEIR REQUIREMENT.?
      
      
      2.CUSTOMER SERVICE HAVE TO BE CHANGE , THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENT,SIMPLY THEY SHOULD NOT TALK LIKE ONE SIDED TRAFFIC....!!!!
      
      
      3.WHERE IS REALITY ABOUT THE ADVERTISEMENT, THROUGH WHICH THEY ARE PROMOTING THEIR BRAND?
      
      
      4.FINALLY WHERE IS THE EXCHANGE FACILITY?
      
      
      5.IS IT MISTAKE FOR A CUSTOMER WHO BOUGHT PRODUCT?"
Galaxy Core,1,"I HAVE ORDERED THIS MOBILE FOR MY FRIEND AND GAVE THE BILLING AND DELIVERY ADDRESS AS MY FRIEND'S ADDRESS ONLY...
      
      
      A FREEBIE OF SAMSUNG BLUETOOTH HEADSET WAS MENTIONED IN THE SITE WHEN I ORDERED IT BUT WHICH IS NOT DELIVERED ALONG WITH THE MOBILE...
      
      WHEN I CLAIMED IT TO FLIPKART, INITIALLY THEY SAID I HAVE TO CLAIM IT FROM SAMSUNG.
      
      FURTHER I ARGUES WITH THEM THEN FLIPKART SAYS THE SELLER HAS REJECTED MY REQUEST AND THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF THE SELLER...
      
      
      I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT IT...
      
      
      THEY HAVE CHEATED ME...
      
      IF THEY HAVEN'T MENTIONED I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT FROM SOME OTHER ONLINE SELLERS FOR LOWER PRICE THAN WHAT FLIPKART HAVE OFFERED...
      
      
      GOT CHEATED..."
Galaxy Core,1,"I HAVE PURCHASE GALAXY CORE 1' AUG. 2013. I CAN PURCHASE ONLY NET SURFING AND LOOKING, BUT 22' SEPT. 2013 AUDIO JACK NOT WORKING I AM USING EAR PHONE LAST 22' SEPT.. EVEN 5 TIME USING HEAD PHONE BUT EAR PLUG NOT WORKING. AND GIVEN TO SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER LAST 24SEPT 13. SERVICE PERSONS ALWAYS SAYS WE WANT MAX. NO OF DAYS. I C'NT GET MY PHONE. AND NOT REPLACED. I AM AFRAID."
Galaxy Core,1,"I HAVE PURCHASED SAMSUNG CORE 8 MONTHS BACK @13000 FROM A SPICE STORE. 2 DAYS BACKS SUDDENLY PHONE STOPS WORKING AND I AM NOT ABLE TO EVEN STITCH ON-OFF THE PHONE . WHEN I WENT THE NEAREST SERVICE CENTRE TO NEHRU PLACE THE CENTRE PEOPLE SAYS PHONE GOT THE MOISTURE ,YOU HAVE TO PAY 13500 TO GET REPAIR AS THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF MOISTURE.
      
      
      IN SAMSUNG SETS ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR LUCK ,DON'T HOPE ANY AFTER SERVICE IF ANY PROBLEM IS THERE ."
Galaxy Core,1,"I HAVE PURCHASED SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE I8262 (METALLIC) RS. 12800.I AM VISIT ANOTHER SHOP THAN I SAW SAME MODEL,CONFIGURATION PRICE 12000.YOU HAVE TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE IN PRICE.I AM NOT HAPPY FOR YOUR SERVICE."
Galaxy Core,1,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE BEFORE 10 DAYS AND ITS HEATS TOO MUCH AND THE MAIN ISSUE IS SMELLING(LIKE WIRE BURNING) FROM HIS BACK SIDE SPEAKER. THIS ISSUE IS NOT ONLY WITH ME, OUR FRIENDS HAVE SAME. YOU CAN ALSO TRY AFTER USING THE PHONE ONLY 20 MINUTES.  AVOID THIS PHONE, TAKE OTHER MODEL OF SAMSUNG."
Galaxy Core,1,"I PURCHASE THIS PHONE IS ABOUT 1MNTH AGO.IT HAS PROBLEM IN BACK KEY,IT IS FUNCTING VERY SLOW.I THINK IT IS SOFTWARE PROBLEM BUT I ALSO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE BUT THIS PROBLEM REMAIN SAME.AND IT ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM ON ITS SPEAKER IT IS VERY WORST QUALITY.SO, DON'T GO FOR IT."
Galaxy Core,1,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE FROM SAMSUNG SMRATPHONE CAFE SINCE STARTING I WAS FACING PROBLEM OF POOR BATTERY BACKUP, I HAVE TO CHARGE IT TWICE OR THRICE A DAY WHILE I WAS KEEPING ALL UNNECESSARY THINGS OFF.
      
      WITHIN 7 DAYS I ALSO FACED PROBLEM THAT SOMETIME IT WAS TAKING CHARGE AND SOME TIME NOT. SOON IT STARTED NOT TO TAKE CHARGE COMPLETELY. THEN I BRING THIS ISSUE IN THE NOTICE OF SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE THEY TOLD PCB BOARD NEED TO CHANGE. I AM WAITING TO GET MY PHONE BACK REPAIRED, WHILE SERVICE CENTRE SAYS THEY ARE WAITING FOR PART TO COME"
Galaxy Core,1,"IF IT PROVIDE SOME GOOD FEATURES THEN HE WILL TAKE 15 THOUSAND ABOVE COST OF MOBILE..HE THINKS INDIANS ARE FOOL..NOW OTHERS COMPANY  ALSO HERE, PROVIDE MANY EXTRA AND ADVANCE FEATURE THAN SAMSUNG UPTO 10,000 OR 12,000 PRICE..REJECT SAMSUNG OTHERWISE THEY WILL NOT DOWN PRICES OF THESE LOW FEATURED PHONES"
Galaxy Core,1,"IF YOU WANT TO SPEND AROUND 13000 RUPEES TO BUY A MOBILE THAT RESTARTS UNPREDICTABLY THEN THIS IS THE RIGHT MOBILE FOR YOU!!!
      
      
      WITHIN 24 HOURS OF BUYING THIS MOBILE, I FOUND THAT THIS MOBILE IS HAVING PROBLEM, IT RESTARTS ON ITS OWN AND IT WAS UNPREDICTABLE. I WENT TO SERVICE CENTRE TO GET A REPLACEMENT, AS I WAS TOLD THAT WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER BUYING IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEM, WE WILL REPLACE THE MOBILE. WHAT I FOUND AT THE SERVICE CENTER WAS THAT THERE FEW MORE COSTUMERS WITH GALAXY CORE, WHO BOUGHT THE PHONE IN LAST 2-3 DAYS, THEY ALL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. THIS MEANS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT ONLY WITH MY CELL PHONE, IT WAS A LARGE SCALE ERROR MADE BY SAMSUNG. I SUSPECT THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE REASON WHY CORE WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN MY CITY FOR SOME DAYS.
      
      
      SO, SERVICE CENTRE WILL NOT GIVE YOU REPLACEMENT ON THE SPOT, EVEN IF YOU GO THERE AFTER ONE HOUR OF BUYING. IT IS COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.
      
      
      NOTE: I GAVE IT 1 RATING BECAUSE, THERE IS NO NEGATIVE RATING OPTION AVAILABLE, AND I HAVE TO COMPULSORILY RATE THE PRODUCT TO POST MY FEEDBACK."

Galaxy Core,1,"IT IS WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE, THAT I BOUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY CORE FROM SHOP ON 13K.IT IS WORK LIKE A CHINA.
      
      DRAWBACK OF SAMSUNG:-
      
      1)	MAIN FUN OF MOBILE IS TO MAKE A CALL FROM ANYWHERE BUT SAMSUNG MOBILE LOOSE THE NETWORK/TOWER , EVEN MY OLD NOKIA N72 SHOWS SAME OPERATOR NETWORK AT SAME PLACE.
      
      2)	SAMSUNG GIVE SLOW RESPONSE TO INCOMING CALL I.E. WAITING FOR LONG TIME TO CONNECT.
      
      3)	TOUCH RESPONSE BECOME WEAK DAY BY DAY.
      
      4)	IT DOES NOT HAVE CANCEL BUTTON/ICON  ON SECOND STAGE OF DIALED  NUMBER ,WHICH MAKE VOUCHER RECHARGE DIFFICULT, OR MAKE INCORRECT INPUT TO CUSTOMER CALL.
      
      5)	IT SUPPORT ONLY 720P I.E. IT DOES NOT SUPPORT FULL HD.
      
      6)	VIDEO RECORDING DOES NOT SUPPORT ZOOM FUNCTION &AMP; RECORDING IS AT 720P BUT STILL HAVE BLACK COLOR IN RECORDING AS COMPARE TO IMAGE CAPTURE. SCREEN VISION ALWAYS CHANGING BLACK TO WHITE AND WHITE TO BLACK VICE VERSA.
      
      7)	SOME TIME SCREEN GET BLACK OR DIM AFTER CHARGING WHICH NEED TO MAKE A RESTART TO MOBILE TO COME TO ORIGINAL.
      
      8)	(IT DOES NOT HAVE LIGHT SENSOR)DISPLAY DOES NOT GLOW MANY TIME AFTER YOU REMOVE IT FROM EAR WHICH MAKE CALL DISCONNECT IMPOSSIBLE STILL YOU REMOVE THE BATTERY, AS SWITCH OFF OR RESTART DOES NOT WORK AT THAT TIME &AMP; CALL IS CONNECTED SO BILLING INCREASES.
      
      9)	NET SPEED IS TOO SLOW THOUGH IT HAVING 1.2GZ PROCESSOR AND  1GB RAM.
      
      10)	I AM USING INBUILT RINGTONE ,STILL IT IS HAVING VERY LOW SOUND  &AMP; DOES NOT  COME TO KNOW EASILY IN TRAFFIC OR T.V SOUND."
Galaxy Core,1,"JUST ONE THING I WANNA SAY ITS A REBOOT OF GALAXY S DUOS

Galaxy Core,1,"MOBILE IS NOT WORKING ON THE FIRST DAY ITSELF. NEED REPLACEMENT PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS REVIEW ASAP.
      
      THANKS IN ADVANCE."
Galaxy Core,1,"MY OLD PHONE: HTC EXPLORER
      
      PROS: FLUID INTERFACE, SUFFICIENTLY FAST, DESIGN
      
      CONS: BULKY, LOW MEMORY
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM A LOCAL RESELLER FOR 14900. FLIPKART IS EXPENSIVE.
      
      PROS: SIZE, MEDIOCRE DISPLAY, AVG WEIGHT, FILE MANAGER
      
      CONS: SO POORLY DESIGNED ON SCREEN KEY PAD, INTERFACE IS NOT FLUID BUT SMOOTH, EARPHONE
      
      
      1GB MEMORY WITH 400MB TAKEN FOR ANDROID, 300 FOR APPS. ONLY 300+ FREE RAM IS AVAILABLE.
      
      
      WHEN YOU TYPE MULTI THREADED MESSAGES, KEY PAD TAKES 50% THE SCREEN HENCE YOU CAN'T VIEW WHAT YOU TYPE! THIS WAS NOT THE CASE WITH MY HTC EXPLORER, MESSAGING WAS EFFORTLESS. FOR THIS REASON I RATE THIS PHONE 1/10! DID ANY SAMSUNG ENGINEER TRIED TYPING MULTI THREADED MESSAGES?!
      
      
      VERDICT: THOSE WHO WANT TO BUY A PHONE OFTEN FOR MESSAGING DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE."

      JUST SEARCH FOR ""SAMUNG WIFI ISSUES"" ON GOOGLE AND YOU WILL COME TO KNOW THE ISSUE IS ALSO WITH GALAXY S4. MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THESE ISSUES. PLEASE CONFIRM BEFORE YOU USE THIS PHONE. SAMSUNG IS NOT BEING HONEST OR HELPFUL ABOUT THIS.
      
      SO BE CAREFUL FOR YOUR OWN GOOD..."
Galaxy Core,1,SAMSUNG THEORY IS MADE FOR PENNY AND SOLD FOR PLENTY.IT HAS BEEN ALWAYS OVERPRICED AND ONCE AFTER LAUNCH ITS PRICE SHOW SHARP FALL.MY FRND BROUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS FOR AROUND 13.5K NOW ITS PRICE IS AROUND 9.5K THIS IS INCIDIENT OF ABOUT 5 MONTHS. IN SOME PHONES SIM 1 SUPPORTS 3G WHILE SECOND ONE DOES'NT ..... SAME DESIGN SAME SPECS IT HAS LEAD TO BOREDOM. S4 HEATING ISSUES. AFTER PAYING AROUND 35K WHAT DO U EXPECT A PHONE WHICH HAS HUNDREDS OF BUGS?????? .GO FOR MMX KARBONN

      PAY FOR THE BRAND, FALL VICTIM FOR THE ADS. CONCEAL THE TRUTH, COMPARE YOURSELF AND LATER BUY."

STILL THE BATTERY SUCKS. IT IS BETTER NOT TO BUY ANY SAMSUNG SMART PHONES."

Galaxy Grand,5,"AFTER USING APPLE FOR MORE THAN 2 YEARS, I WAS HESISTANT TO SWITCH TO ANDROID, NO PHONE IN THE MARKET COULD TEMPT ME EXCEPT THIS ONE....AT SUCH A PRICE RANGE IT IS A TOP QUALITY PHONE FROM SAMSUNG..DISPLAY IS FANTASTIC, CAMERA PERFORMANCE IS CLASS APART, MOTION SENSORS ARE AMAZING AND SMART ENOUGH, BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY REALLY GOOD..RAM AND CPU PERFORMANCES HAVE ACTUALLY STUNNED ME..MULTI-WINDOW FEATURE, DUAL SIM, ONE HANDED OPERATION UPDATES, ALL THIS HAVE SURELY MADE MY DEAL WORTH IT..BEST PHONE EVER IN 5 INCH..DO GO FOR THIS RATHER THAN ITS CHEAP DUPLICATES..."
Galaxy Grand,5,"ALRIGHT. I BOUGHT THIS PHONE (NOT OFF FLIPKART, UNFORTUNATELY) AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT IT BEHAVED NOTHING LIKE ITS REVIEWS. SO I'LL BEGIN WITH AN HONEST PROS AND CONS LIST:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      LARGE, EXPANSIVE SCREEN IS SEXY. SURE, NOT SAMOLED, BUT SEXY NEVERTHELESS. I HAD SOME TIME WITH A MICROMAX CANVAS HD AND YOU COULDNT TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN SCREENS. HONESTLY.
      
      
      ZIPPY AND LIGHT, AND LOTS OF OPTIONS WITH JELLYBEAN. HOWEVER THERE ARE VERY RARE CASES WHEN IT STUTTERS JUST A BIT, AFTER YOU END ALL THE PROCESSES TO FREE UP SOME RAM.
      
      OTHERWISE, ITS FAST AND FLUID
      
      
      NATUREUI: THE PHONE ROCKS SAMSUNGS NATURE UI, AND ALTHOUGH BEAUTIFUL ITS ALSO PRETTY CONVENIENT, LIKE PULL-DOWN TOGGLES FOR BRIGHTNESS, ETC
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      SCREEN COULD HAVE AT LEAST BEEN 200 PPI, BUT AS I GOT THIS BEAST FOR ONLY 17500 I CANT COMPLAIN.
      
      
      COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE THINNER.
      
      
      CAMERA COULD HAVE BEEN SHARPER.
      
      
      AND TO ALL THOSE WHO WHIP UP THE MMX CANVAS HD, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THE PHONE STACKS UP PRETTY WELL TO THIS. JUST TO MAKE SOME STUFF CLEAR, THOUGH: THE HD'S PROCESSOR IS BASED ON THE CORTEX A-7 ARCHITECTURE WHEREAS THE GRAND'S IS CORTEX A-9. SO THERE IS A DIFFERENCE, AND MORE CORES MAY NOT ALWAYS BE BETTER- THE SOFTWARE NEEDS TO USE ALL THE CORES EFFICIENTLY. BUT SURE, SOMETIMES QUAD CORE IS BETTER.
      
      
      AND ONE LAST THING, THE GRAND IS A GREAT OPTION AS A 'BRANDED' CANVAS HD, IF YOU LIKE. I'M JUST SAYING THAT IF YOU WANT A PHONE WITH FEATURES ALMOST THE SAME AS THE HD BUT BRANDED AND WITH RELIABLE CUSTOMER CARE, THE GRAND IS YOU OPTION. I ALSO RECOMMEND YOU TO CHECK OUT AN S3 OR S2 OR SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL, IF YOU FIND THE SPECS  LITTLE DULL.
      
      
      HOPE NOBODY THINKS OF ME AS A SAMSUNG FANBOY, WHICH I AM NOT. :D"
Galaxy Grand,5,AMAZING SET... THANKS TO SAMSUNG .... FOR AN OUTSTANDING PHONE.... THE BEST POSSIBLE PHONE AT THIS RATE IS VERY FEASIBLE..I AM ENJOYING THE HIGH END FEATURES OF THIS SET...FOUND VERY MUCH USEFUL...I WILL SUGGEST THIS FOR ALL WHO GOES BEYOND THE PURCHASE OF 15K.
Galaxy Grand,5,"AT FIRST I SHOULD SAY I'M WRITING A REVIEW FOR THE FIRST TIME
      
      I AM A BENGALI MEDIUM STUDENT SO MY ENGLISH IS NOT SO GOOD BT AS I WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE.......I COULD NOT WAIT TO SHARE MY FEELINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE
      
      
      BELIEVE ME THIS WORTHS THE MONEY.....I BOUGH IT FROM A SHOP NEAR MY HOUSE AT 19000/-
      
      I WAS IN A GREAT CONFUSION WHEN READ NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PHONE.....I WAS CONFUSED BETWEEN MICROMAX AND GRAND BUT ATLAST I BOUGHT IT...
      
      BT AFTER USING THIS LOVELY DEVICE I'M MORE THAN JUST SATISFIED......MANY REVIEWS SAYS ABOUT THE DISPLAY....THOUGH I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY SUPER AMOLED OR IPS SCREEN..BT THIS IS A VERY GOOD DISPLY I'VE EVER SEEN...BCZ MY PICTURES TAKEN BY SONY CYBERSHOT LOOKS EXCELLENT IN THIS DISPLAY....I JUST WANNA SAY THE RESOLUTION IS NOT ANY ISSUE....IT CAN BEE EASILY IGNORED....THE DISPLAY BRIGHTNESS IS SOOO GOOD AND UNDER DIRECT SUNLIGHT IN FULL BRIGHTNESS IT IS EASILY READABLE AS NORMAL...LIGHT SENSOR IS SOO GOOD TOO
      
      
      U ALL KNOW THE CONFIGURATION OF THIS PHONE SO I DO NOT HAVE TO WRITE ANY
      
      BUT I MUST SAY ANYBODY LIKE ME WHO WANTS A FULL HD VIDEO RECORDER AND DECENT PICTURES TAKEN BY PHONE CAMERA WITH MORE OR LESS 8MEGAPIXELS....AND WANTS IT TO BE SO FAST WITH JELLYBEAN OS AND A BIGGER DISPLAY LIKE 5INCH AND ENOUGH PHONE MEMORY TO HELP THE APPS TO WORK FLAWLESSLY....STYLISH.WITH FLIP COVER AND GOOD BATTERY BACKUP
      
      THEN THIS IS THE BEST PHONE.....
      
      I'M JUST A STUDENT FROM A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY....THE PRICE 20000 IS A LOT OF MONEY TO ME...BT I THING MY MONEY IS WELL INVESTED
      
      IF U R FREAKING OUT READING SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS THEN DON'T BE...
      
      ITS DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD
      
      BATTERY EASILY RUNS 3 DAYS WITH ONLY CALLS 2HOUR PER DAY AND SOME MESSAGES
      
      EASY TO HANDLE...NOT SO BIG
      
      PICTURE QUALITY WILL SURPRISE U (A PIC IS ABOUT 4MB IN SIZE)
      
      THE LED FLASH IS FAR MORE BETTER THAN EXPECTED
      
      NO LAG AT RUNNING 6APPS AT A TIME
      
      U CAN OPEN HTML PAGES SAME AS UR COMPUTER OR LAPTOP
      
      FULLY CHARGES IN 3HOURS
      
      IT HAS MANY FONTS LIKE CORBY
      
      IT HAS FACE AND VOICE UNLOCK
      
      VOICE COMMAND FEATURE (S VOICE)
      
      
      WHAT DO U WANT MORE IN A ANDROID SMART PHONE? IF U AR A MIDDLE CLASS MAN WHO WANT TO BUY A GOOD ANDROID PHONE WITH ALL THE BEST LATEST FEATURES IN IT THEN INVEST UR MONEY...YOU'LL NEVER REGRET THIS
      
      
      REMEMBER FULL HD VIDEOS CAN BE TAKEN BY CLASS 4 MMC ALSO"
Galaxy Grand,5,"BEST PHONE TO USE WITH A VERY GOOD PRICE TAG.IAM USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST TWO  MONTHS ITS VERY GOOD AND FAST
      
      
      
      THANK YOU SAMSUNG FOR A VERY GOOD MOBILE"
Galaxy Grand,5,"BOUGHT THIS MOBILE. IN SIMPLE WORDS, THE MOBILE IS GOOD, WON'T SAY AWESOME. RINGTONE SOUND IS NOT AT PAR EXPECTATION. BUT THE BRAND VALUE MATTERS, AND THAT'S WHY SAMSUNG AND NOT MMX, XOLO OR KARBONN. GOOD JOB SAMSUNG!!"
Galaxy Grand,5,"BOUGHT YESTERDAY FROM A LOCAL DEALER METALLIC BLUE ONE... REALLY ""GRAND EXPERIENCE""... I AM A ANDROID USER SINCE LAST TWO YEARS... THIS GRAND IS SUPERB FULLY LOADED WITH FEATURES....
      
      FOR THE BUYERS WHO ARE CONFUSED AND DOING COMPARISON BETWEEN MICROMAX, LUMIA, ETC.. SHOULD NOT THINK OTHER THAN GRAND... UNDER BUDGET OF RS20K I WOULD SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND THIS BEAUTY....
      
      
      EVERYTHING IS TOP NOTCH: CAMERA, PERFORMANCE, GAMES, FLUIDITY..... SCREEN SIZE WITH PREMIUM FLIP COVER IS SURELY A HEAD TURNER...
      
      SCREEN RESOLUTION ON PAPER SEEMS TO BE POOR BUT I DONT KNOW HOW SAMSUNG HAS MANAGED TO PROVIDE SUCH A BRIGHT AND VIVID COLOUR SCREEN THAT TOO WITH SHARP TEXTURE... SCREEN RESO IS EXCELLENT YOU WILL NOT BE DISHARTENED...
      
      
      DONT THINK... CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICK GRAND..."
Galaxy Grand,5,"COMPARED TO THE COMPETING PRODUCT LINES IN SIMILAR COST/FEATURE SEGMENT BY OTHER BRANDS, I GOT A GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY HERE.
      
      
      ITS A GOOD VALUE PROPOSITION FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A MID SEGMENT SMART PHONE WITH TWO SIMS  :-)
      
      
      FURTHER THE OWN NOW OFFER BY SAMSUNG MAKES THE COMBO BUY A WIN-WIN SITUATION
      
      
      PS: THE METALLIC BLUE VARIANT HAS BETTER LOOKS COMPARED TO THE WHITE ONE"
Galaxy Grand,5,"DEAR ALL,
      
      
      I AM (SO-FAR)SATISFIED WITH THE GRAND, WHICH I PURCHASED A MONTH BACK FROM CHROMA(THANE, MAHARASHTRA BRANCH). ITS A GREAT PHONE WHICH I FEEL COULD BE VERY EASILY HANDLED INSPITE OF ITS GIGANTIC SIZE. SOME PROS AND CONS:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1) EASY SWITCHING BETWEEN THE SIM CARDS(SINGLE CLICK)
      
      2) LARGER DISPLAY MAKES READING FAR FAR FAR EASY( I NOW FIND SMALLER PHONES IRRITATING)
      
      3) 1.2 GHZ PROCESSOR IS CLEARLY A BENEFIT OVER OTHER ANDROID PHONES -  ITS DEAD FAST.
      
      4) I HAVE ABOUT 6000 CONTACTS LOADED( MANY OF THEM ARE DUPLICATES ). YET, THE PHONE DOES NOT LAG IN SEARCHING THEM.
      
      5) AUTOFOCUS OF THE CAMERA IS JUST TOO GOOD.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) BATTERY LIFE IS JUST OK(WITH FULL DAY WIFI - 1 HOUR OF TALKING, 20 MINS SKYPE VIDEO, IT LASTS ABOUT 16 HOURS)
      
      2) ONLY WHITE AND BLUE COLORS AVAILABLE( WHITE GETS DIRTY -  MINE IS ALREADY STAINED WITH MY DIRTY HANDS - TRAVELLING IN MUMBAI TRAINS)
      
      3)CHARGER CABLE LENGTH IS JUST TOOOOO SMALL.
      
      
      OVERALL MY EXPERIENCE IS VERY GOOD AND ONE CAN GO FOR THIS PHONE WITHOUT ANY HESITATION."
Galaxy Grand,5,"DONT BELIEVE IN ANY OF THE REVIEWS WHICH ARE LISTED BELOW MENTIONING THE SCREEN HAS A POOR RESOLUTION. ITS BRILLIANT. THE IS WORTH FOR EVERY PENNY, AND DON'T EXPECT S4 LIKE FEATURES OR PERFORMANCE FOR A MID RANGE MOBILE. I'M HAPPY ABOUT CHOOSING GALAXY GRAND DUOS. I RECOMMEND THIS PHONE FOR THOSE WHO WANT A REAL PHABLET EXPERIENCE AND DON'T HAVE A DEEP POCKET."
Galaxy Grand,5,"EXCELLENT SERVICE AND FOLLOW UP
      
      VERY QUICK DELIVERY.GOOD FOLLOW UP ON THE EMI OFFER.
      
      GREAT MOBILE FROM SAMSUNG. NICE BIG DISPLAY AND TOUCH SENSITIVITY.
      
      LARGE NUMBER OF PRE-INSTALLED APPS GIVES A NICE START WITH THE MOBILE."
Galaxy Grand,5,"FIRST I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU FLIPKART STAFF FOR PROVIDING ME SPEEDY DELIVERY ....I HAD BOOKED IT ON JUNE 9 NIGHT AND GOT DELIVERED BY JUNE 11 EVENING SO FAST ISN'T IT.
      
      NOW COMING TO MOBILE REVIEW IS THAT .......THE FIRST THING I LIKED ABOUT GRAND WAS ITS LOOKS .....WHEN I HOLD IT IN MY HAND IT FEELS AS IF I'M HOLDING A TAB.
      
      THE SECOND THING IS IT'S BATTERY BACK UP UNTIL NOW I'M USING THIS MOBILE JUST BY CHARGING ONCE......ANY HOW I'M VERY HAPPY WITH MY NEW GALAXY GRAND....I SAY BUY THIS MOBILE FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR MID RANGE......AND DON'T LISTEN TO ANY OF THOSE REVIEWS...."
Galaxy Grand,5,FIRST I WOULD LIKE SAY THANKS!!! FOR SAMSUNG FOR PROVIDING 15% CASH BACK OPTION AND FLIPKART FOR QUICK AND EXCELLENT DELIVERY. IN SIMPLE WORDS I WOULD SAY IT IS WORTH AND VALUE FOR MONEY... YOU CAN ENJOY SAMSUNG GRAND..
Galaxy Grand,5,"FIRST OF ALL I MUST SAY THAT FLIPKART AGAIN DESERVES APPRECIATION BECAUSE OF THEIR QUICK AND EFFICIENT SERVICE. I ORDERED THE DEVICE 0N 15 MAY AND IT WAS DELIVERED ON 18 MAY. THAT MAKES ME A FAN OF FLIPKART ONCE AGAIN.
      
      THE GALAXY GRAND DUOS 19082 IS REALLY VERY NICE. THE FIRST FEEL OF THE DEVICE IS REALLY GOOD. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT ITS BATTERY PERFORMANCE AS I HAVE READ IN THE REVIEWS THAT THE BATTERY DRAINS OUT VERY SOON. HOWEVER THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A RUMOUR AS I HAVE EXPERIENCED NICE BATTERY PERFORMANCE TILL NOW. I USE IT FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND TILL I SLEEP AT ONE CHARGE. THE PRIMARY CAMERA IS QUITE GOOD. THE ONLY PROBLEM I FACED WAS CONNECTING THE DEVICE TO MY PC. AFTER THREE DAYS TRY I DOWNLOADED THE DRIVER FROM A WEBSITE AND NOW THAT PROBLEM IS OVER. SAMSUNG SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED THE DRIVER WITH THE DEVICE. THEIR WEBSITE ALSO COULDN'T PROVIDE THE PROPER DRIVER.(IF MY SEARCH WAS NOT PROPER THAN I AM SORRY). AGAIN DOWNLOADING THE USER MANUAL IS A HEADACHE. I HAVEN'T DOWNLOADED IT TILL NOW AS MY PREVIOUS TRIES FAILED. ANOTHER ANNOYING THING IS THAT THE DEVICE DOESN'T HAVE ANY PRE-INSTALLED GAMES OR SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES SUCH AS FACEBOOK. APART FROM ALL THESE DRIVER OR USER MANUAL RELATED PROBLEMS THE PHONE IS A MASTERPIECE. THE DISPLAY IS GREAT IN CONTRAST TO THE NEGATIVE CRITICISM I CAME ACROSS AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD ENOUGH. I DIDN'T REGRET BUYING THIS PHONE AND I THINK YOU WON'T TOO."
Galaxy Grand,5,"FIRST....TO FLIPKART....GREAT SERVICE GUYS. I ORDERED THIS PHONE AT 1530 ON 24TH OF APRIL AND WAS DELIVERED ON 25TH NOON.
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN A SYBIAN PHONE USER FOR PAST 15 YEARS. THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE....AND LET ME TELL YOU GUYS...I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY CHOICE. I TOOK 10 DAYS TO GO THRU' EACH AND EVERY REVIEW OF THIS PHONE. THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS HAD ME SKEPTICAL OF BUYING THIS PHONE...BUT AFTER COMPARING ALL THE FEATURES/FACTS/REVIEWS AND OPINIONS OF MY FRIENDS/COLLEGUES, I PURCHASED IT.
      
      
      IF YOUR ARE A FIRST TIMER FOR ANDROID PHONES AND CAN AFFORD TO PAY 21K, I SUGGEST GO FOR THIS. THE EMI SCHEME ALSO WORKS WELL. I PURCHASED USING HDFC BANK CREDIT CARD. LEAVE ALL THE TECH JARGONS ASIDE....HOW MANY OFFICE GOERS ARE PLAYING GAMES? GAMERS PLEASE BUY A PS2/XBOX INSTEAD OF A PHONE.
      
      
      I HAVE CONFIGURED MY GMAIL, YAHOO MAIL AND ALSO MY OFFICE MAIL ON THIS. THERE IS NO LAPSE IN THE SPEED. BATTERY BACKUP IS GREAT. CONFIGURE IT TO WI-FI AND DOWNLOADS ARE VERY FAST.
      
      
      MUSIC OUTPUT IS ALSO VERY GOOD BUT WITH MY PHILIPS SHP1900 HEADPHONE, THE OUTPUT IS REALLY GREAT. THE VIRTUAL 7.1 OPTION IN THE MUSIC PLAYER IS GREAT.
      
      
      PHOTOS &AMP; VDIOS ARE VERY CLEAR AND SHARP. HD RECORDING IS AWESOME.
      
      
      AND LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, I WROTE THIS REVIEW BY LOGGING IN TO FLIPKART FROM MY GALAXY GRAND...DIDNT EVEN HAV TO OPEN MY LAPTOP."
Galaxy Grand,5,"FLIPKART. I'D LIKE TO RATE YOU MORE THAN 5 FOR DELIVERYING THE PRODUCT..I HAVE ORDERED IT 3RD JUNE AT 3:36. I HAVE GOT THE PRODUCT IN MY HAND IN 4TH JUNE BEFORE 2 P.M. REALLY APPRECIABLE.
      
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PRODUCT ,----
      
      
      FRIENDS,  ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M MORE THAN HAPPY WITH IT. I DONT WANT TO COMPARE WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCT OR ANY INDIAN BRAND LIKE MICROMAX CAUSE I'M A MICROMAX LOVER TOO. BUT CERTAINLY U CAN'T COMPARE PRODUCT LIKE THIS FLAGSHIP DEVICES WITH ANY ORDINARY DEVICES.
      
      
      I HAVE TOOK NEARLY MORE THAN 15 DAYS TO PROVIDE MY REVIEW SO AS TO PROVIDE REVIEW AT GREATER DETAILS.
      
      
      ONCE YOU'LL OPEN THE BOX I'M QUITE SURE U'LL BE AMAZED BY ITS SUPER LOOK AND DESIGN. I NEVER LIKED SAMSUNG AS BCOZ ALL THEIR DEVICES LOOKED SAME TO ME, THIS IS MY FIRST PHONE WHICH IS FROM SAMSUNG. AND I' LIKE IT VERY MUCH.DONT COMPARE WITH THE SPEC COZ WEN U'LL BE USING IT U'LL GET DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. I USED DUAL CORE 1GHZ MICROMAX DEVICE( MICROMAX A89) AND AFTER SOME DAYS I HAVE BOUGHT SONY XPERIA TIPO(832 MHZ). AS COMPARED TO PERFORMANCE MICROMAX LAGGING FAR FAR BEHIND THAN SONY IN ANY ASPECT.
      
      
      ABOUT THIS PHONE I HAVE TRIED MANY APPLICATION.EVERYTHING WORKS SMOOTH. THANKS SAMSUNG FOR PROVIDING THE MULTIWINDOW FEATURE . I AM LOVING IT.
      
      ,PEOPLE IN MY OFFC HAVING S3 USE MY PHONE MORE THAN THEIRS AND SAYS WOW. ITS AWESOME BCOZ OF ITS DISPLAY..AS A USER I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE DISPLAY QUALITY IT PRODUCES IF U SEE ANY HD VIDEO.
      
      
      ABOUT GAMING--THOUGH OTHER SAYS IT IS NOT DESIGNED FOR HIGH END GAMING . BUT STILL I HAVE TRIED A FEW GAMES AND IT WORKED FINE.
      
      1&GT;VIRTUAL TENNIS 2&GT; MODERN COMBAT 4 (ONLY PROB U CAN'T VIEW UR GUN SOME TIME OTHERWISE GAME IS RUNNING SMOOTHLY) 3&GT;TEMPLE RUN ALL VERSION 4&GT; DEAD TRIGGER
      
      5&GT; REAL RACING 3 . 6&GT;BATMAN 7&GT; MAX PAYNE 8&GT;WIPEOUT
      
      
      STILL TO TRY ASPHALT7,NOVA ,INFILTRATION,NFS MW,FIFA12(THOUGH EVERYONE SAYS ITS WORKING).
      
      
      ABOUT CAMERA - 4.8/5
      
      WATCHING VIDEO ---MORE THAN AWESOME
      
      FINALLY THE MAIN THING IN PHONE--CALLING--&GT;-CLARITY FINE, AND
      
      YOU HAVE SMART DUAL SIM FEATURE.
      
      
      YOU'LL HAVE THOUSANDS OF OTHER FEATURE IN THIS PHONE WHICH IS THE BEST THING..CHECK YOUTUBE YOU'LL GET SAMPLE OF THOSE FEATURES.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1&GT; YES THIS PHONE HAS HUNG ISSUE.NOT EVERYTIME.I HAVE FACED IT NOT ON NORMAL USING. BUT IF U USE IT AS UR MODEM OR IF U CONNECT UR MOB TO UR PC WHILE 2 OR 3 APPLICATIONS ARE RUNNING. IT MIGHT GETS HUNGED. WHICH I HAVE FOUND. OTHERWISE NORMAL MULTITASKING IS GOOD. NO PROB.
      
      
      2&GT; THOUGH THEY SAY IT AS 8 GB. U'LL ONLY GET AROUND 4 GB. DISAPPOINTMENT IS U CAN'T MOVE UR APPS TO EXTERNAL SD OTHERWISE IT IS ROOTED. THIS IS WHERE I'M DISAPPOINTED. WHENEVER I WANTED TO TRY NEW GAMES I NEED TO DELETE ONE PREV GAME AND INSTALL NEW ONE.
      
      
      I AM IN LOVE WITH MC4 ,BCOZ OF THIS MEMORY PROB I COULD NOT TEST ASPHALT 7 AND OTHERS.
      
      
      NOTHING ELSE AS A USER, NOT AS A PERSON TO COMPARE MOBILES BY SPECS.
      
      
      NOW MONEY IS URS ,HENCE CHOICE IS URS. ONLY THING IS WHETHER U WANT TO LIVE A GRAND LIFE OR NOT..    ;)
      
      
      TO FLIPKART AGAIN,,REALLY APPRECIABLE WORK. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
      
      
      I WANT TO GIVE 4.7 .THERE IS NO OPTION HENCE SELECTING 5."

      SO ITS A COMPLETE 8 GB MEMORY.

Galaxy Grand,5,"HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR MY 1ST ANDROID SMARTPHONE FOR OVER 6 MONTHS. WITH BUDGET OF 10K WAS ALL SET TO BUY MMX 110 BUT THEN THOUGHT TO WAIT FOR MMX 116. BUT WITH MMX 116 AT 16K, I TOO HAD TO INCREASE MY BUDGET TO 15K AND STARTED TO LOOK OUT FOR OTHER OPTIONS FROM SAMSUNG, IPHONE, HTC ETC. CONSIDERING BRAND STABILITY, FEEDBACK, AFTER SALES SERVICE AND MOBILE FEATURES ZEROED DOWN ON SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND AND BOUGHT IT 1 MONTH BACK IN OWN NOW SHCEME.
      
      COMING TO THE GRAND PHONE NOW, WHAT A CHOICE I WOULD SAY, GRAND STANDS TO ALL MY EXPECTATIONS. MY PRIORITY WAS BUSINESS EMAILS ON MOBILE AND ITS A PLEASURE TO READ, WRITE EMAILS ON GRAND. COMPARED TO LUMIA MODELS BELOW 20K AND GRAND IS MUCH BETTER IN DISPLAY. MUSIC, VIDEO, GAMES WORK SMOOTHLY ON GRAND. TOUCH RESPONSE IS BUTTERY SMOOTH. BATTERY LIFE ALSO GOOD, LAST MORE THAN A DAY IN CASE U DO NOT PLAY GAMES TOO MUCH. OVERALL I FEEL WITH THE BRAND IMAGE, STABILITY AND FEATURES OFFERED, GRAND IS THE PHONE TO GO FOR. I AM 150% HAPPY WITH GRAND. OTHER TECHNICAL PRO AND CONS HAVE BEEN COVERED IN EARLIER FEEDBACKS SO NOT TOUCHING IT. WITHOUT SECOND THOUGH GO FOR GRAND, ITS WORTH IT."

Galaxy Grand,5,"HI
      
      STOP READING ALL BAD REVIEW OF THIS PRODUCT, I HAVE USED IT MORE THAN ONE WEEK...NOW ONLY I AM POSTING THIS REVIEW
      
      
      SCREEN CLARITY IS GOOD
      
      GOOD NETWORK DATA USAGE
      
      VERY FAST UI
      
      SMART DUAL SIM...
      
      
      PLEASE DONT COMPARE GALAXY GRAND WITH ANY NOKIA, MICROMAX OR SONY....
      
      SAMSUNG HAS ITS OWN CLASS...VERY GOOD AND AMAZING FEATURES ARE THERE LIKE SMART STAY, SAMRT ALERT AND MULTIWINDOW...
      
      
      FLIPKART IS DOING A VERY NICE JOB..I HAVE ORDERED ON 28 MAY AFTERNOON WITH IN 18 HOURS I GOT THE PRODUCT...KEEP IT UP GUYS"
Galaxy Grand,5,"HI,
      
      
      FIRST TO ALL OTHER REVIEWERS PLS STOP COMPARING SAMSUNG WITH MICROMAX OR XOLO
      
      
      MY CHOICE :-
      
      LUMIA 720 VS GALAXY GRAND VS GALAXY GRAND QUATTRO WIN
      
      
      AS ALL OF OTHER PROSPECTIVE BUYERS, I WAS ALSO HIGHLY CONFUSED AFTER READING REVIEWS ON FLIPKART FOR CHOOSING BETWEEN THESE 3 PHONES UNDER 20K.
      
      
      GALAXY GRAND WON... FOR ME BECAUSE OF.
      
      1) DUAL SIM - ALL LUMIA PHONE LOOSE
      
      2) 8 MP CAMERA - GALAXY QUATTRO LOOSES (WANTED TO UPGRADE PHONE CAMERA)
      
      
      AFTER RECEIVING THE PHONE WITHIN 2 DAYS FROM FLIPKART.COM
      
      
      FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE : - I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE HANDLING THE DEVICE BECAUSE OF ITS LARGE SCREEN AND FLIP COVER WHICH CAME WITH THE PHONE
      
      BUT WHEN I DECIDED TO KEEP THE COVER IN THE BOX AND USE THE PHONE AS IT IS I FELT MORE COMFORTABLE AND STARTED GETTING USED TO IT AND FINALLY I LOVE THE PHONE AND FEEL PROUD OF CARRYING IT
      
      
      THEREFORE,I COULDNT RESIST SHARING MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOU GUYS
      
      
      ON FIRST DAY I WAS NOT AT ALL EXCITED BECAUSE OF BASIC IOS AND APPLE USER, JUST MADE FEW BASIC SETTINGS, TRANSFERED MY CONTACTS AND STARTED MY DAILY USE, I REALISED THAT THE PHONE KEYPAD APP TAKES FEW SECONDS TO LOAD, THIS WAS THE CASE ALSO WITH CONTACTS AND MESSAGES.
      
      I WAS MORE DISAPPOINTED. I THOUGHT IT WAS DUE TO LIVE WALLPAPERS, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.
      
      
      DOWNLOADED BASIC GAMES FROM PLAY STORE FOUND THEM OK BUT NOT CONVINCING
      
      ALSO DOWNLOADED ZOMBIE HIGHWAY AND MY PHONE STARTED HANGING ,,......????
      
      I WAS SHOCKED AFTER SPENDING 19K MY PHONE HANGS... , CANT ACCEPT IT.
      
      
      THEN I GOOGLED AND MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS LIKE TURNED ANIMATIONS OFF, CLOSED FEW UNWANTED SERVICES, DELETED UNWANTED APPS AND SWITCHED OFF ALL WIDGETS.
      
      NOW THE PHONE GOT A PERFORMANCE BOOST, IT JUST ROCKS ITS SUPER FAST NO COMPLAINS WHILE MAKING CALLS, SLECTING CONTACTS AND DAILY ACTIVITIES
      
      
      FINAL TEST HARDCORE GAMING TO TEST DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND GPU OF GALAXY GRAND. BLA BLA ...
      
      ZOMBIE FRONTIER 2, BEACH BUGGY &AMP; TEMPLE RUN 2, TRUST ME GUYS I WAS  ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED PLAYING THESE GAMES ON THIS PHONE, WITHOUT ANY LAGS OR DELAYS, ITS SUPERB EXPERIENCE, I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE
      
      
      SUGGESTION -
      
      1) BUY CLASS 6 OR CLASS 10 MICRO SD CARD, THIS WILL IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE
      
      2) CLOSE ALL YOUR WIDGETS, THEY EAT RAM (DONT WORRY ABOUT LIVE WALLPAPERS)
      
      
      CONS -
      
      1) NO USB OTG (USB ON THE GO)
      
      2) CANT READ FROM SCREEN IN SUNLIGHT
      
      
      PROS -
      
      1) RECEPTION QUALITY IS VERY GOOD
      
      2) DUAL SIM MANAGEMENT IS AMAZING
      
      3) GAMING AND GRAPHICS IS GOOD
      
      4) BIG SCREEN IS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER PHONES
      
      5) CAMERA QUALITY AND PICTURE TAKEN ARE AMAZINGLY CLEAR AND CRISP
      
      6) VIDEOS ARE IN FULL HD QUALITY

Galaxy Grand,5,"HI,
      
      FLIPKART DELIVERED THE PRODUCT PROMPTLY AND IN EXCELLENT PACKAGING. FOR THE PHONE I CAN SAY ITS A GOOD PHONE, DEPENDS ON YOUR REQUIREMENTS. FOR MY REQUIREMENT I FOUND THE PHONE TO BE GOOD.
      
      THANKS FLIKPART!!!!"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I ACTUALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS FACED BY THE USERS.I BOUGHT IT A DAY AGO AND IT IS JUST AWESOME.IT HAS COOL FEATURES LIKE MULTI WINDOW,S VOICE,S MEMO,SMART STAY ETC.I READ IN OTHER REVIEWS THAT PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING FOR MMX A116 BUT THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT IT WILL NEVER GET A SOFTWARE UPDATE IN THE FUTURE,I HAVE FUNBOOK P300 BUT IT HAS NO UPDATE FOR J.B. YET.AND AS FAR AS THE CPU IS CONCERNED IF WE SEE THAT THE NO. OF CORES DOESN'T CHANGE THE SPEED(IPODS AND IPAD AND IPHONE HAVE DUAL CORES SO WHAT)"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I AM USING THIS MONSTER PHONE FOR FOR TWO WEEK. I HAVE BECOME MORE SOCIAL AFTER ACQUIRING IT. I LIKE EVERY THING ABOUT IT, ITS 5 INCH SCREEN, ITS SOBER WHITE COLOR, ITS STEEL RIM, THE BUNDLE 50 GB DROPBOX , CAMERA, SOUND, SAMSUNG INTERFACE....
      
      
      OVER ALL A GOOD PHONE TO A REGULAR USER.
      
      
      NO COMMENTS ABOUT GAME..."
Galaxy Grand,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST WEEK. I HAVE A MICROMAX CANVAS HD ALSO. ONE THING IS CLEAR. WHAT U PAY IS WHAT U GET. U CAN NOT GET GOLD IN PRICE OF SILVER.
      
      SOME PEOPLE ARE COMPARING THIS WITH MICROMAX CANVAS HD. IT IS JUST MEANINGLESS. IF U DONT HAVE BUDGET, BUY MICROMAX. BUT DONT HATE OTHER PRODUCTS.
      
      IN ANY ANGLE CANVAS HD CANNOT MATCH GRAND.
      
      GRAND HAS A POWER HOUSE INSIDE. I PLAYED HEAVIEST GAMES FLUIDLY IN THIS.BUT CANVAS HD LAGS AFTER THE MOMENT U START IT. ONE MORE THING, UNLES U SAW ON THE BOX, U CANNOT FIND THIS AS A WVGA DISPLAY. COLOURS ARE VIVID AND PIXEL DENSITY IS AMAZING. I DID NOT GET ANY LAG TILL NOW. BUT BATTERY IS A POINT OF CONCERN DUE TO THE HUGE PROCCESSOR. OTHERWISE COMPARABLE WITH S3"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I BOUGHT IT AT A VERY GREAT PRICE. GOT IT FOR RS 16624 ONLY WHICH IS GREAT. FLIPKART AS GREAT AS ALWAYS RECEIVED THE NEXT DAY ITSELF.
      
      
      COMING TO THE PRODUCT. MY DAD LIKED THE METALLIC BLUE COLOR A LOT.. IT LOOKS A LOT PREMIUM THAN THE WHITE ONE.. AND SINCE HE IS IN CORPORATE LIFE FOR MANY MANY YEARS HE WANTED THE PHONE WHICH SHOULD BE COMPLETELY FOR PROFESSIONAL USE. HE WAS USING A BLACKBERRY CURVE 9360 BEFORE AND AFTER A YEAR USING IT HE WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED EVEN THOUGH ITS USED MY TOP CORPORATES ON A LARGE SCALE..
      
      
      AS PER MY DAD..
      
      THE DISPLAY IS AWESOME.. THE OLD PHONE HAS 245PPI AND THIS ONE HAS 187PPI .. THEN TOO HE DIDN'T FIND AND PPI ISSUE AND SCREEN COLOR REPRODUCTION AND VIEWING ANGLES IN ABSOLUTELY GREAT FOR THE PRICE.. HAD TWEAKED THE FONT STYLES AND SIZE AND THE TEXT LOOKS CLEAR AT A NORMAL USE..
      
      
      CAMERA IS GREAT.. TAKES VERY GOOD PHOTOS.. ALSO SOUND QUALITY IS LOUD AND CLEAR.
      
      
      CALL QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD. AND FLIPCOVER IS ALSO GOOD AND HANDY..
      
      
      THE ONLY ISSUE HE FOUND IS THAT THE PHONE IS BULKLY BUT DOESN'T FEEL MUCH WHEN YOU ARE USING ONLY DURING CALLING U SOMETIMES ON LONG CALLS FEELS THAT YOUR HANDS GETS PAINED A BIT. SO I HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE HIM A SAMSUNG BLUETOOTH HEADSET WHICH COSTS AT 699 @FLIPKART SO THAT THIS ISSUE ALSO SOLVES..
      
      
      OVERALL WOULD RATE 5/5 SINCE THE PRICE WHICH I HAD GOT IS GREAT AND NO OTHER BRANDED PHONES WOULDN'T MATCH EASILY.. EXCEPT LG OPTIMUS L9. BUT I WON'T SUGGEST ANYONE A LG PHONE EXCEPT NEXUS 4 SINCE I HAS VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH LG OPTIMUS 2X .."
Galaxy Grand,5,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE VIA FLIPKART, WHEN I USE THE MOBILE I FOUND THE POWER  KEY WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. I CALLED THE CUSTOMER CASE AND RAISED AS ISSUE; AS A RESULT I GOT REPLACEMENT FOR MY MOBILE WHICH IS DELIVERED NEXT DAY TO MY DOOR STEP.
      
      
      FLIPKART PROVIDE A QUALITY OF SUPPORT TO THE CUSTOMER."
Galaxy Grand,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE A FORTNIGHT AGO AND DAMN I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE!
      
      
      HANDS-ON REVIEW FROM MY END WOULD GO THIS WAY.
      
      
      1.LOOKS - 9/10
      
      2.BATTERY LIFE - 6/10
      
      3.MULTIMEDIA FEATURES - 9/10 (LOW RESOLUTION COSTING A STAR)
      
      4.EVERYDAY USAGE PERFORMANCE - 8/10 (MAY HANG WITH MANY OPEN APPS)
      
      
      I'M A MUSIC FREAK AND PLUGGED IN MOST OF THE TIME.
      
      THE MUSIC SQUARE, POP OUT VIDEO PLAYER, VIDEO SNAPSHOT FEATURE AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS, IT MAKES A POWERFUL MULTIMEDIA TOOL.
      
      
      THE ONLY AND MAIN DRAWBACK OF THIS PHONE IS IT'S LOW RES DISPLAY, WHICH DIDN'T MATTER AS THE PIXELS ARE PRETTY CRISP AND WON'T BE VISIBLE UNTIL YOU TAKE A CLOSE VIEW.
      
      
      FOR THE ONE'S COMPARING THIS PIECE OF ART WITH MICROMAX,THIS PHONE HAS ALMOST DOUBLE THE BATTERY LIFE OWING TO THE SAME LOW RESOLUTION DISPLAY AND THE DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, REDUCING THE NECESSITY TO RUN FOR FREQUENT POWER SUPPLY.
      
      
      THIS PHONE BECAME A PART OF MY LIFE IN A FEW DAYS AND IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DUAL SIM ANDROID PHONE THAT WILL BLEND IN TO YOUR LIFE, GO FOR THIS PHONE.
      
      
      THE PRICING CAN BE AS LOW AS APPROX 18000 INR...IT HAS AN OFFICIAL PRICE TAG OF AROUDN 21K BUT YOU DO GET OFFERS PROVIDING YOU A CONSIDERABLY LOW RATE."
Galaxy Grand,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN FEB 2013, AND TILL NOW IT HAS NOT DISAPPOINTED ME A SINGLE TIME. SOMETIMES IT DO GET HANGED, BUT ITS NATURAL WITH ALL THE SMARTPHONES IN THE MARKET...
      
      THE CAMERA IS BRILLIANT AND TOUCH IS OK.
      
      OVERALL, I'M MORE THAN HAPPY WITH ITS PERFORMANCE TILL NOW...."
Galaxy Grand,5,I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN THE FIRST WEEK OF FEB AND NOW ITS ALMOST I M USING IT FOR 4-5 MONTHS. I CAN SAY U CAN TRUST THIS PHONE FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW...THIS PHONE IS AMAZING AT THIS PRICE RANGE...I HAVE PLAYED SO MANY GAMES ON THIS BUT THERE IS NO LAGGING ISSUES...PHONE SPEED IS GOOD...BATTERY IS OK...OVERALL SATISFIED WITH GRAND..
Galaxy Grand,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE LAST MONTH , ITS AN AMAZING PHONE , BT A BIG PROBLEM IN THIS PHONE IS THAT SUBWAY SURFER NOT SUPPORT IN THIS PHONE , N ACTUALLY I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ONLY FOR GAMES , BT ITS DISAPPOINTED ME , AFTER THIS , GRAND IS FANTABULOUS"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I DIDN'T PURCHASE THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART BECAUSE I WANTED TO TRY A BUNCH OF PHONES, FOR MY SELF, FROM A RETAIL STORE. ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME MRP BUT THEY ADDED TAX AND IT BECAME 1K COSTLIER... I WANT TO GIVE MY REVIEW FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BUY FROM FLIPKART
      
      
      OK SO BEFORE BUYING I CHECKED THE FOLLOWING PHONES BY HAND : LUMIA 720, MMX CANVAS HD, XPERIA L, QUATTRO. THE BEST DISPLAY AND CAMERA(EVEN IF ITS 6.7 MP IT'S A CARL  ZEISS) WAS LUMIA 720.. BUT IT WAS SLOW IN RESPONSE, XPERIA L HAD A GOOD DISPLAY BUT I DIDN'T LIKE ITS BUILD IT FELT LIKE A BRICK WITH NOT A COMFORTABLE DESIGN TO HOLD.. NOW  MMX CANVAS HD GO FOR THIS ONLY IF U CAN'T CROSS 14K RUPEES IN UR BUDGET. IT'S OKAY ON PAPER BUT THE SALES PERSON CLAIMED IT GETTING SENT TO REPAIR 7/10 TIMES AND THERE IS ONLY 1 SERVICE CENTER IN MY CITY. TRUST ME AFTER USING MMX CANVAS HD I WILL NEVER GO FOR IT... IT'S TOO BRIGHT IT'S JUST WHITE LIGHT THERE IS TOO MUCH WHITENESS IN ITS DISPLAY.. THE BATTERY IS A JOKE. QUATTRO WAS A STRIP DOWN VERSION OF GRAND WITH LESSER PER INSTALLED SAMSUNG APPS (WHICH ARE OKAY IF U DON'T USE THOSE APPS).
      
      
      NOW, SORRY FOR THE LONG REVIEW BUT I HOPE MY EXPERIENCE HELPS YOU DECIDING ON THE PHONE.
      
      THE GRAND IS VERY BIG AND STURDY AND NOT THAT HEAVY, THE TEXTS ARE VERY BIG AND EASY TO READ IN IT. IT IS QUITE FAST AND RESPONSIVE, OF COURSE IT'S MORE RESPONSIVE AND GIVES MORE BATTERY LIFE, IF YOU DISABLE SOME UNWANTED FEATURES LIKE S VOICE ON LOCK SCREEN AND DOUBLE TAP HOME BUTTON ETC... BATTERY CAN DRAIN A BIT FASTER THAN EXPECTED BUT THAT DEPENDS ON USAGE AND CLOSING BACKGROUND APPS. THE DISPLAY IS VERY NICE, DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT PEOPLE SAY WHEN THEY CLAIM THE DISPLAY IS BAD, LOOK FOR YOURSELF BEFORE BUYING.. IT'S NOT AN AMOLED SCREEN BUT ITS NOT BAD EITHER.. DO NOT COMPARE THIS WITH AMOLED, OF COURSE IT WILL LOSE, IF YOU WANT AMOLED GO FOR AN AMOLED PHONE. THIS PHONE COULD BE 2K CHEAPER BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A BAD PHONE. FROM MY EXPERIENCE I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE WHO HAS A BUDGET OF 20K RUPEES. BUT THEN AGAIN, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED THE PHONE FOR BEFORE BUYING. IF YOU WANT CAMERA AND SCREEN RESOLUTION, I WOULD SAY NOKIA LUMIA 720 OR XPERIA L . IF YOU WANT ALL IN ONE WITH A BIG SCREEN I WOULD SUGGEST GRAND OR QUATTRO. I PERSONALLY FEEL GRAND IS BETTER THAN QUATTRO.  DO NOT THINK ABOUT MMX CANVAS HD UNLESS YOU HAVE A 15K BUDGET, EVEN THEN THINK TWICE, DON'T SEE THE SPECIFICATIONS ON PAPER AND BUY. TRUST ME I WAS GONNA BUY MMX CANVAS HD BLINDLY, BUT GLAD I OPENED MY EYES. GRAND IS AN ALL ROUNDER IT HAS EVERYTHING. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL. GO FOR IT!"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I GIFTED THIS PHONE TO MY MOTHER. SHE IS AT THE BEGINNING STAGE OF USING SMART PHONES.
      
      THIS PHONE IS QUITE GOOD IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING. TOUCH IS A NOT SUPER AMOLED LIKE OTHER SMART PHONES BUT STILL VERY GOOD QUALITY. CAMERA AND ALL THE OTHER FEATURES ARE GOOD . THIS COLOR IS VERY BEAUTIFUL.IF YOU ARE AT MEDIUM LEVEL OF USING SMART PHONES THIS PHONE WOULD BE THE BEST FOR YOU OTHER WISE YOU CAN GO FOR NOTE 2 OR S4"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I GOT THE GALAXY GRAND A MONTH AND A HALF AGO. SO FAR THE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD AND AT PAR WITH WHAT I EXPECTED.
      
      
      I DID NOT GET THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART, I BROUGHT IT FROM A SAMSUNG SMART CAFE STORE ON THE OWN NOW SCHEME.
      
      
      DEAR FLIPKART, PLEASE BAN REVIEWS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT USED THE PHONE.
      
      
      THINGS THAT MATTER:
      
      
      BATTERY: I HAVE HAD DAYS WERE I HAVE GOTTEN 20 HRS. ONCE TO MY DISMAY I USED IT FOR A WHOLE 33 HOURS. AND I ONCE I FOUND I WAS DONE BY 11 HOURS OF USAGE. ON AN AVERAGE I GENERALLY GET 14 15 HOURS ON MODERATE USE.
      
      (MODERATE USE - MOBILE DATA (OR WIFI WHEN AVAILABLE) ON ALL THE TIME, GTALK AND WHATSPP FULL TIME ON, 5 TO 8 CALLS AVERAGE OF 5 MINS EACH, 2 EMAILS FULLY SYNCED, 15 MINS OF GAMING, 30 40 MINS OF BROWSING.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE: PEOPLE MUST STOP FUSSING ABOUT THE PROCESSOR SPECS AND SUCH. OUTPUT PERFORMANCE IS A COMBINATION OF MANY FACTORS.
      
      
      ON A GALAXY GRAND, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LAG WHILE OPENING APPS OR MOVING BETWEEN HOME SCREENS.  I HAVE NOT USED 3G SO FAR ON THE PHONE.  I DO WATCH VIDEOS ON A 2G NETWORK AND IT IS FASTER THAN ONE WOULD EXPECT.
      
      
      DISPLAY: SPECS ARE FOR ALL TO READ. BUT ACTUALLY IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHETHER THIS PHONE IS AN UPGRADE FOR YOU OR ARE YOU MOVING DOWN FROM A HIGH END PHONE. THE DISPLAY LOOKS BRILLIANT TO ME AS I HAVE UPGRADED FROM A SMALLER PHONE. YES THE DISPLAY RESOLUTION IS LESS FOR A 5 INCH SCREEN BUT THERE IS NO VISIBLE PIXELATION EVER. UNDER BRIGHT SUNNY CONDITIONS THE SCREEN IS STILL BRIGHT ENOUGH AND CAUSES NO INCONVENIENCE WHATSOEVER.
      
      
      THE LARGE SIZE MEANS READING ONLINE IS A DELIGHT AND SO IS THE VIDEO WATCHING EXPERIENCE.
      
      I DONT THINK I CAN EVER GO BACK A DISPLAY SMALLER THAN THIS.
      
      
      VIDEOS: VIDEO WATCHING EXPERIENCE IS OBVIOUSLY NEXT ONLY TO THE NOTE/NOTE 2. LOVE THE LARGE REAL ESTATE AND CAN WATCH A MOVIE WITHOUT THE FEEL OF WATCHING IT ON A PHONE.
      
      
      SIZE AND TEXTING: A LITTLE INCONVENIENT COZ OF ITS SIZE. BUT ONE GETS USED TO IT. GREAT THING IS THERE IS A ONE HAND OPERATION OPTION THAT ONE CAN SWITCH EASILY TO (CAN SWITCH INSTANTLY WHILE TYPING). THE KEYBOARD SHRINK TO A SMALL SIZE AND ONE CAN TYPE WITH ONE HAND AND CAN MOVE IT TO LEFT OR RIGHT SIDES OF THE SCREENS FOR USE WITH EITHER OF YOUR HANDS.
      
      
      ALSO ITS A TRADE OFF BETWEEN EASE OF TEXTING AND VIDEO AND GAMING EXPERIENCE ON A LARGE SCREEN.
      
      
      GAMING: NOT MUCH OF A GAMER, TEMPLE RUN 2, COMMANDO D DAY, FLICK FOOTBALL, REAL BASKETBALL WORK LIKE MAGIC. NO LAGS NO ISSUES.
      
      
      CAMERA: VIDEO RECORDS IN FULL HD AND IS BRILLIANT(LOWER RES AVAILABLE TOO, CAN BE CHANGED IN SETTINGS) PHOTOS ARE OKAY, BUT AS THE LIGHT GOES DOWN THE GRAINS CATCH UP REAL QUICK.
      
      A CAMERA HARD KEY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL. THIS PHONE DEFINETLY NEEDED ONE, BECAUSE OF ITS LARGE SIZE IT BECOMES A BIT CUMBERSOME TO CLICK INSTANTLY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE USING A FLIP COVER.
      
      
      THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE OUT THERE IN THE MARKET, REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU NEED.
      
      
      THE ONLY THING THAT ITCHES ME A BIT IS THE LARGE SIZE. IN A TIGHT JEANS IT BECOMES A LITTLE INCONVENIENT. BUT THEN I REPEAT, ITS A TRADE OFF.
      
      
      GET A GRAND IF YOU NEED: A LAG FREE EXPERIENCE, A LARGE SCREEN, DUAL SIM AND A BATTERY LIFE THAT STAYS THROUGH THE DAY.
      
      
      REALLY A GRAND EXPERIENCE, THANKS SAMSUNG. ITS A 4.5 STARRER. HALF A STAR DEDUCTION FOR I JUST WISH THE BATTERY STOOD OUT FOR A TAD LONGER.
      
      
      PEOPLE WHO DO NOT USE THE PHONE, HOW CAN YOU REVIEW IT?"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I GOT THIS PHONE 2 DAYS AGO AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS BECOZ IT FULFILS ALL OUR DAILY NEEDS WITH PERFECTION.
      
      
      AS COMPARED TO XPERIA L WHICH COMES AT SAME PRICE RANGE JUST DOESN'T STAND AGAINST THIS PHONE WHICH HAS 1GZ DUAL CORE ONLY AND A SMALLER SCREEN OF 4.3INCH.GRAND HAS BIGGER SCREEN AND EVEN THE SCREEN QUALITY IS VERY GUD DESPITE OF AN AVG. RESOLUTION OF 480*800 BUT STILL THE TEXT IS CRSIP AND CLEAR
      
      
      NOW PROS-
      
      
      GUD PROCESSOR OF 1.2GHZ AND EVERY THING SMOOTH LIVE WALLPAPERS ARE JUST BUTTERY SMOOTH.
      
      
      GUD GPU WHICH HELPS RUNNING HIGH END GAMES VERY SMOTHLY.I INSTALLED REAL RACING 3,NFS MOST WANTED,FRONTLINE COMMANDO D-DAY,DEAD TRIGGER
      
      WHICH RUN AS SMOOTH AS THEY CAN.SO THIS PHONE IS BEST FOR GAMING
      
      
      SCREEN IS PRETTY GUD THRERE IS NO PIXELATION 98% OF USAGE ONLY WHILE READING TEXT OF SMALL FONT
      
      
      BATTERY IS GUD IT GIVES A GUD BATTERY BACKUP OF 1 DAY
      
      
      MUSIC IS DECENT.BOTH SPEAKER AS WELL AS IN HEADSETS PROVIDED WHIS THIS NOT THE BEST BUT STILL VERY GUD.
      
      
      CAMERA IS ALSO PRETTY GUD WHILE CAPTURING PHOTS &AMP; VIDEOS.
      
      
      CAN VIEW FULL 1080P VIDEOS WHICH RUNS SMOOTHLY
      
      
      NOW CONS-
      
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY IS JUST 3.96GB AVAILABLE WHICH IS LESS WHEN YOU INSTALL HEAVY GAMES.
      
      
      OTHERWISE I HAVE NO OTHER CONS TILL YET.SO GO FOR IT BLINDLY IF
      
      YOU WANT TO DO GAMING AND MULTIMEDIA FOR MANY YEARS."
Galaxy Grand,5,"I GOT THIS PHONE UNDER OWN NOW PLAN SO GOT IN AROUND 17.7K.. ITS ABSOLUTELY VALUE FROM MONEY IN THAT PRICE... AMAZING EXPERIENCE FROM SWITCHING IT FROM A NOKIA PHONE... LOVING EACH MOMENT WITH THE GRAND :-)
      
      
      ALSO WANT TO THANK FLIPKART FOR THEIR AMAZING SERVICE.. GOT THIS PHONE IN LESS THAN 2 DAY!!!"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I HAD BOUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND. I HAD RECIVED MY DEVICE ON SECOND DAY OF ORDER.GOOD DELIVEY SERVICE. ALSO GOOD CUSTOMER SUPPORT FROM FLIPCART TEAM.CHIPEST PRIZE THEN MARKET.
      
      
      HAVE THIS PHONE FOR MONTHS NOW AND LOVE IT, ITS EXCELLENT FOR THE PRICE, IT HAS A GOOD FOLLOWING ON XDA AND LOTS OF CUSTOM ROMS, MODS AND THEMES AVAILABLE FOR IT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THINKING OF BUYING IT AND THE SCREEN IN TOP NOTCH, DON?T GET TOO BOTHERED ABOUT THE PPI ETC ETC..
      
      ITS AN EXCELLENT SCREEN FOR THE RESOLUTION."
Galaxy Grand,5,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AT 21500, BEFORE THE PRICE REDUCED, I.E. IN THE FIRST WEEK OF MARCH 2013.
      
      
      THIS IS A VALUE FOR MONEY HANDSET! DOES EVERYTHING THAT IS EXPECTED OUT OF A SMART PHONE AT THIS PRICE.
      
      
      1) BIG 5 INCH SCREEN WITH VERY GOOD CLARITY, BRIGHT, GREAT COLOUR SATURATION AND LOUD ENOUGH SPEAKER - ENJOY VIEWING VIDEOS WITH OTHERS
      
      
      2) 8 MP MAIN CAMERA WITH FLASH AND 2 MP FRONT CAMERA - SHOOT GREAT PHOTOS (HAS CONTINUOUS SHOT MODE- 20 RAPID CLICKS, IMAGE EDITOR ETC.), RECORD VIDEO IN HD (1920X1080), MAKE VIDEO CALLS (3G / SKYPE ETC.)
      
      
      3) ALMOST 4 GB AVAILABLE INTERNAL MEMORY - SUFFICIENT FOR ALL THE APPS ONE WANTS. (FROM FB,TWITTER TO CARDIO TRAINER, GOOGLE SKY MAP, AUTO CALL RECORDER ETC.)
      
      
      4) EXPANDABLE MEMORY UP TO 64 GB - I HAVE PURCHASED A SANDISK 64GB CLASS 10 MICROSDHC CARD FROM FLIPKART. ENOUGH TO STORE ALL THE VIDEOS, AUDIO, IMAGES, DOCUMENTS.
      
      
      5) DOWNLOAD FREE POLARIS 'DOCUMENT EDITOR' FROM SAMSUNG APPS AND YOU ARE READY TO DO SOME OF YOUR OFFICE WORK!
      
      
      6) DOWNLOAD FREE UC BROWSER (WITH TEXT RE-FLOW IN ZOOM) FROM GOOGLE PLAY AND THEN DOWNLOAD IT'S ADOBE FLASH PLAYER PLUGIN AND VIEW WEBSITES EVEN WITH FLASH CONTENT, JUST LIKE ON YOUR PC.
      
      
      7) DUAL SIM - GOOD FEATURE. ALTHOUGH I USE ONLY 1 SIM AS MY OTHER NO. IS CDMA.
      
      
      8) MANY OTHER SMART FEATURES LIKE MULTI-WINDOW,
      
      MOTIONS LIKE TILT TO ZOOM, TURN OVER TO MUTE/PAUSE, PALM SWIPE TO CAPTURE, DIRECTLY CALL THE NO DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN BY JUST HOLDING THE PHONE TO YOUR EAR! ETC;
      
      SMART ONE HAND OPERATION,
      
      VIEWING HD VIDEOS FROM HANDSET ON MY PC SCREEN VIA WI-FI,
      
      
      9) ONLY PROBLEM - 2100 MAH BATTERY MAKES YOU RECHARGE IT, EVERY DAY. :-(
      
      BUT IF THAT REALLY BOTHERS ONE, THEN ONE MAY BUY ADDITIONAL BATTERY, I GUESS! :-)
      
      
      THIS PHONE, 'SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND DUOS I9082' HAS BECOME MY COMPANION, SINCE LAST 2 AND A HALF MONTHS....!
      
      
      JUST LOVE IT!"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I HAVE USE THIS PHONE ONLY THIS IS THE BEST PHONE ON OTHER COMPANY MODELS.. SURELY WE CAN SPEND THIS AMOUNT ON THIS PHONE.THOSE WHO COMPARE PREMIUM BRANDED PHONES LIKE APPLE, SAMSUNG, HTC ETC, PLEASE USE THOSE PHONES AND THEN WRITE THE REVIEW."
Galaxy Grand,5,"I JUST LOVED IT THERE'S NO PHONE LIKE THIS AND SO STUPID THE HATERS FOR THIS MOBILE ARE.IT HAVE AMAZING FEATURES AND THE FLIP COVER IS DAMN AWESOME. LOVLIEST MOBILE AT NOT SO GREAT PRICE.OVERALL IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH THIS GREAT MOBILE. ITS A MUST BUY THING.
      
      
      HOPE THIS HELPS YOU. :)"
Galaxy Grand,5,"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE ABOUT 2 WEEKS BACK AND HAVE SUBJECTED IT TO ALL KINDS OF STRENUOUS TASKS SUCH AS GAMES, GRAPHICS, VIDEO RECORDING, WIFI ETC. AND CAN NOW SAFELY SAY THAT THIS PHONE IS ""AN OUTSTANDING VALUE FOR MONEY AND THE BEST DUAL SIM PHONE TILL DATE"". TILL NOW ALL DUALS SIM MOBILES HAVE BEEN GROSSLY UNDERPOWERED BUT NOT THIS ONE.
      
      PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CRITICIZING THIS PHONE JUST LOOKING AT IT'S SPECS NEED TO EITHER GET HOLD OF THIS DEVICE AND USE IT THEMSELVES IN WHICH CASE I AM SURE THE GRAND WILL WIN THEM OVER OR SIMPLY SHUT UP AS THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.
      
      FOR STARTERS, THE DISPLAY OF THE PHONE DESPITE BEING ONLY 187 PPI ON PAPER, IS EXCELLENT. I MYSELF HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE DISPLAY PRIOR TO BUYING IT BUT I FOUND THE DISPLAY TO BE  CRISP, CLEAR AND SHARP. WITH NAKED EYES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN IMAGINE THAT IT IS NOT HIGH ON THE PPI INDEX. EVEN DURING WEB BROWSING OR GAMES YOU DO NOT FEEL THE NEED FOR A BETTER DISPLAY. INDOORS THE DISPLAY WORKS AND FEELS GREAT. HOWEVER, OUTDOORS IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY. SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY IS VERY POOR AND THAT IS ONLY WHEN YOU WOULD KNOW THE DISPLAY IS NOT QUITE WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE. HOWEVER, INDOORS WITH THE NEW TOUCHWIZ UI ON JELLY BEAN ANDROID OS IT LOOKS FANTASTIC. KUDOS TO SAMSUNG. THE UI IS SMOOTH AND THE PHONE NEVER LAGS. EVEN WHILE PLAYING DEMANDING GAMES LIKE NOVA 3...YES IT DOES RUN ON THIS DEVICE TO THE SURPRISE OF MANY CRITICS WHO WERE SCEPTICAL OF THE NEW AND HITHERTO UNKNOWN CHIPSET AND GPU, THE PHONE PERFORMS ADMIRABLY. POP UP PLAY AND MULTISCREEN MULTITASKING IS A TREMENDOUS ADDITION. OVERALL THE PHONE LOOKS AWESOME AND FEELS GREAT TO USE. IT WILL REALLY SURPRISE YOU WITH ITS CAPABILITIES ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING ALL THE NONSENSE THAT SOME ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS DEVICE WITHOUT ACTUALLY USING IT. ONLY DOWNER WOULD BE THE BATTERY. THOUGH IT IS RATED AT 2100MH, IT IS NOT QUITE ENOUGH AS WITH SUCH A POWERFUL CPU AND GPU ONE WOULD BE TEMPTED TO PLAY A LOT OF GAMES WHICH WOULD DEPLETE THE BATTERY FAST. IF YOU WANT A PHONE WITH A SLICK AND SMOOTH UI, ENOUGH POWER TO RUN DEMANDING GAMES AND GOOD LOOKS THEN GO FOR IT."
Galaxy Grand,5,"I RECEIVED THIS PHONE ON 21ST MAY 13, THROUGH FLIPKART.COM. FIRST OF ALL THANKS TO FLIPKART TEAM FOR EXCELLENT PACKAGING AND TIMELY DELIVERY.
      
      I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE THE MOMENT I OPENED THE BOX. THIS PHONE IS TRUE VALUE FOR MONEY NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF LOOKS, IN TERMS OF FEATURES &AMP; SPECIFICATIONS ALSO."
Galaxy Grand,5,"I RECEIVED THIS PHONE ON 29TH JUNE 2013 FROM FLIPKART. THE DESIGN &AMP; THE MAKE IS REALLY SUPERB..!! THE APPS, THE SPEED THAT THIS BEAST HAS...! I'M GLAD TO HAVING PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR AFTER HUNTING A MONTH ON VARIOUS SMART PHONES.. :)
      
      
      THANKS A LOT FLIPKART..!!"
Galaxy Grand,5,"IF MULTIMEDIA IS WHAT MATTERS TO YOU, THEN THE GALAXY GRAND IS A BETTER PURCHASE.
      
      
      I PERSONALLY USE A NOTE N 7000, TWO OF MY TEAM MATES USE SAMSUNG GRAND DUOS 19082. VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE SUPPORT.
      
      
      I WAS IN ETTUMANOOR, A PLACE IN KOTTAYM DISTRICT OF KERALA AND MY PHONE GOT WET IN RAIN. I TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL SERVICE CENTER WHO CLEANED IT UP AND RETURNED IN AN HOUR FOR FREE.
      
      
      WHAT YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER HERE IS THAT SAMSUNG IS A TRIED-AND-TESTED BRAND, KNOWN FOR ITS QUALITY AFTER-SALES SERVICE AND SUPPORT.
      
      
      IT INSPIRES MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE EVENT OF THINGS GOING WRONG AS COMPARED TO MICROMAX, WHICH DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT TRACK RECORD IN AFTER-SALES SUPPORT, NOR THE SAME NUMBER OF SERVICE CENTERS."
Galaxy Grand,5,"IN THE FIRST LOOK, THE DISPLAY IS HUGE AND IT IS VERY LIGHT TO HOLD! FROM MY EXPERIENCE, THE PROS ARE: JELLYBEAN MAKES THIS PHONE FUNCTION VERY INTERESTING. IMAGE CLARITY IS GOOD, BUT ON ZOOMING TO MAXIMUM, THE QUALITY IS NOT THAT GREAT. CAMERA HAS A LOT OF EFFECTS AND THE FRONT CAMERA IS ALSO GREAT. GENERALLY, SCREEN RESOLUTION IS DECENT.. IF YOU ZOOM IN ALSO, THE QUALITY IS GOOD. THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD, MUSIC OUTPUT AND VOICE CALLING IS VERY PLEASING. VERY CRISP SOUND ON CALLS. AS FOR THE CONS, THE CAMERA'S ZOOM-IN WAS A LITTLE POOR AND THE PROCESSOR MAKES IT SLOW AT TIMES. GALAXY GRAND DOESN'T SUPPORT USB HOST, NO SUPPORT FOR EXTERNAL PENDRIVE.. WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IT COULD SUPPORT S-PEN TOO. THE PRICE IS REASONABLE AND I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY DISAPPOINTING FEATURE FOR ITS COST"
Galaxy Grand,5,"IT AMAZED ME. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T REVIEWING BUT CRITICIZING. BUT NEVER BOW TO THEM .
      
      
      I HAVE GOT THIS PRODUCT 2 MONTHS BACK. SO FAR, IT NEVER FAILED TO AMAZE ME. EVERYDAY I USE IT AS IF IT IS NEW PHONE. SCREEN IS TOO AWESOME AND YOU WONT WANT TO HAVE AMOLED AFTER YOU SEE THIS. IF YOU ARE MOVIE-WATCHER OR A BOOK READER, YOU SHOULD HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO BUY THIS!!!"
Galaxy Grand,5,"IT IS WORKING FINE. I INSTALLED A LOT OF APPS WHEN I GOT IS NEWLY DUE TO WHICH IS WAS GET HANGGED SEVERAL TIME. THEN UNINSTALLED UNNECESSARY APPS AND NOW IT IS WORKING FINE. NEVER FACED ANY PROBLEM THEN AFTER. MUSIC, CAMER, FLAS LIGHT ALL ARE OK. IT IS A VALUE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY PAID."
Galaxy Grand,5,"ITS A GOOD PHONE. BOUGHT IT FROM FLIPKART TODAY ONLY... BEST IN THE SEGMENT. GUYS I JUST WANT TO ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION TO ALL THE CRITICS THAT IF IT IS A BAD PHONE THEN WHY THE SAMSUNG DISCOUNT SCHEME WAS FINISHED JUST IN FEW HOURS 2-3 DAYS BACK. THE REASON IS THAT IT IS A GOOD SMART PHONE IN MEDIUM BUDGET. GUYS I PURCHASED IT FOR 17.5 GRAND AND NOW CHECK THE PRICE IT IS 19.5 GRAND..
      
      
      THANKS"
Galaxy Grand,5,I'VE USED IT FOR MORE THAN MONTH  AND ITS PRETTY GOOD AND EXCELLENT. .AND I DONT FINE ANY LAGS  ALL THE GAMES PLAY VERY SMOOTH I'VE INSTALL MORE THAN 11 GAMES AND APART OF THAT SOME ARE ABOUT 700MB TO 1.8 GB ..SO GO FOR IT AND IT IS A GOOD BIG SCREEEN ENTERTAINMENT..
Galaxy Grand,5,"JUST DONT LISTEN TO ANYONE SAYING MICROMAX IS BETTER THAN GRAND. FIRST GO N TRY BOTH THE PHONE IN STORE, U WILL DEFINITELY GO FOR GRAND, IM DAMN SURE, ONLY ONE ISUUE WITH GRAND IS BATTERY BACK UP, REST ALL IS PERFECT, IM A PROUD OWNER OF GALAXY GRAND :)"
Galaxy Grand,5,"MY 3RD BUY FROM FLIPKART.
      
      MY 1ST ANDROID.
      
      MY 1ST SAMSUNG.
      
      
      I DON'T WANT TO PRAISE AND APPRECIATE FLIPKART ANYMORE BECAUSE EVEN THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE THE BEST.
      
      
      REVIEW:
      
      
      PEOPLE KEEP REVIEWING WITH THE PROS AND CONS, BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS 100 TIMES BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS PHONES.
      
      
      IT IS A BIG DEAL FOR ME THAT I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND I DON'T WANT TO SHOW-OFF MY TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THIS REVIEW WHICH CAN MAKE A NEW BUYER THINK AND COMPROMISE THE DESIRE TO BUY A PHABLET.
      
      
      IT IS A PHABLET SO IT OUGHT TO BE SUPER BIG AND IF YOU KEEP MESSING AROUND WITH INTERNET AND THAT TOO WITH 3G IN THIS PHONE, THAN BATTERY WILL BE USED. FOR ME THE CON IS THAT THEY GIVE WHITE HEADSETS EVEN WITH METALLIC BLUE COLOR AND THAT MAKES AN ODD COMBINATION.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE WISE IT'S AWESOME.
      
      
      SO IF YOU WANT TO BUY THIS PHONE, DON'T CARE ABOUT THE TECHNICAL CONS AS THEY DEPENDS ON OUR USE.
      
      
      PROS ARE WELCOMED AND CONS DON'T MATTER. THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE!
      
      
      BUY IT AND STAY HAPPY!

      DUSTBIN AND CHEAP
      
      
      ITS TOY NOT A PHONE
      
      ITS NOT A PHONE , ITS TOY WHICH U PLAY , 5 MOST IMPORTANT THINGS MISSING FROM S4
      
      1- MICROSOFT OFFICE IS NOT AVAILABLE
      
      2- NO XBOX GAME INTEGRATION
      
      3-NO OFFLINE NAVIGATION AND NO WIRE LESS CHARGER

      5- LAST AND IMPORTANT NONSENSE AND NOT REQUIRED HARDWARE WHO USE OCTA PROCESSER BUSHIT ,ITS NOT A HIGH END COMPUTER ,
      
      
      THIS IS WHAT SOME PEOPLE ARE WRITING AS REVIEW. THE ABOVE ALL ARE WINDOWS PHONE FEATURE HOW CAN THEY BE AVAILABLE IN ANDROID PHONE???? WHAT U WILL DO WITH XBOX GAMING INTEGRATION WITH ANGRY BIRD???? AND WHEN U R USING SONY PS3 (MOSTLY USED). OTHER OFFICE SUITES ARE SIMILARLY CAPABLE OR EVEN MORE CAPABLE THAN MICROSOFT IN PHONES. U HAVE TO COPY AND DOWNLOAD EVERY THING FROM SKY DRIVE IN A WINDOWS PHONE... WHAT THE ""*"" AND PEOPLE GIVEING NEGATIVE REVIEW TO SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 IN GRAND PAGE...
      
      
      DO YOU BELIEVE THIS TYPE OF REVIEW....?????  WATCH REVIEWS BY IGYAAN, GADGET PORTAL OR WATCH THE PHONE IN ACTION IN YOUTUBE ... U WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PHONE IS CAPABLE OF.. I AM NOT A SAMSUNG FAN RATHER I AM NOKIA LOYALIST BUT THIS PHONE REALLY ATTRACTED ME.."

Galaxy Grand,5,"THIS REVIEW IS IN RESPONSE TO MR. SRINIVAS M'S REVIEW. AFTER READING YOUR REVIEW, I CAME TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE SIMPLY BOASTING ABOUT YOUR SO CALLED KNOWLEDGE.
      
      1. YOU DO NOT OWN THIS PHONE.
      
      2. YOU CANT EVEN SPELL BROADCOM CORRECTLY(YOU SPELLED BROADCOMM)
      
      3. YOU ASKED 'WHY WOULD SAMSUNG USE THIS PROCESSOR INSTEAD OF THEIR OWN PROCESSOR'?
      
      YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT SAMSUNG USES QUALCOMM PROCESSORS( SNAPDRAGON 400, 600 &AMP; 800 ARE EXAMPLES) AS WELL. PERHAPS YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING IN DETAIL ABOUT THE PROCESSORS WHICH ARE USED IN MOBILE PHONES. BROADCOM VIDEOCORE PROCESSORS ARE POWER EFFICIENT THAN OTHER PRCOESSORS WITH SAME CAPABILITY(MAY BE SAMSUNG COULD NOT ACHIEVE THE POWER EFFCIENCY OF BROADCOM PROCESSOR). YOU CAN READ ABOUT SAMSUNG GALAXY SII PLUS (TRY WWW.GSMARENA.COM. TRY THE REVIEW) WHICH USES THE SAME BROADCOM PROCESSOR.
      
      4. YOU DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BROADCOM. THEY ARE ONE OF THE TOP SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. IF YOU HAVE GOT A WIFI/BLUETOOTH/GPS/NFC DEVICE, THERE IS MORE CHANCE THAT IT IS A BROADCOM CHIP.
      
      5. SAMSUNG DOES NOT NEED TO TELL YOU(YOU IN PERSON) ABOUT THE PROCESSORS THEY USE. YOU CAN SEARCH IT IN THE NET AND FIND OUT YOURSELF. THE PROCESSOR HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN MANY WEBSITES.
      
      6. THIS PHONE HAS ENOUGH POPULARITY AND IS LIKED BY MANY PEOPLE WHO OWNS IT. IF YOU EXPECT THE BEST DISPLAY CLARITY, THEN DON'T BUY IT. THIS PHONE IS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIKES BIG SCREEN AND THOSE WHO WANT GOOD BATTERY LIFE. WHEN SCREEN RESOLUTION INCREASES, THE POWER NEEDED INCREASES. THE DISPLAY QUALITY IS NOT BAD AFTER ALL OF THIS PHONE.
      
      
      PS: I DO NOT OWN THIS PHONE. BUT, I USE IT EVERYDAY."
Galaxy Grand,5,"TRUST ME FRIENDS&GT;&GT;
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND I AM SURELY LOVING IT. I DID EVERY POSSIBLE RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING THIS PRODUCT AND ONCE I RECEIVED IT I AM IMPRESSED BY THIS PRODUCT...
      
      
      THE MAIN THINGS THAT I WILL POINT OUT WILL SURELY HELP YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT PRODUCT&GT;&GT;&GT;
      
      
      1. RECHARGE THE BATTERY WHEN U BUY THIS PRODUCT BUT BEFORE RECHARGING PLEASE DRAIN THE FULL BATTERY AND THEN CHARGE IT FULLY..FOLLOW THIS FOR 1-2 WEEK...U WILL LOVE THE BATTERY LIFE IN THIS CASE.
      
      
      2. DISPLAY IS GREAT, BEST AMONG THE OTHERS..MICROMAX IS NOWHERE NEAR IT..5/5
      
      
      3. PROCESSOR SPEED IS SUPERB, BETTER THAN OTHERS 5/5
      
      
      4. RAM IS QUITE LARGE AND I GIVE A 4.5/5
      
      
      5. STORAGE IS ALSO GOOD, IF ONLY THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN 8 GB FREE INBUILT, WHEREAS U WILLL GET 4GB FREE ONLY...4/5
      
      
      6. THE BEST WAY TO SUSTAIN ITS BATTERY LIFE IS BY KEEPING THE BATTERY IN POWER SAVING MODE, AND TRUST ME GUYS IF U KEEP THE MOBILE IN POWER SAVING ALL APPS AND FUNCTIONALITY WILL WORK AS IT WORKS, BUT IF U WANT TO PLAY GAMES THEN U NEED TO TURN OFF POWER SAVING.
      
      
      7. LOOK IS VERY GOOD AND FLIP COVER IS THE EBST.5/5
      
      
      8. HD VIDEOS ARE FANTASTIC..BELIEVE ME FEW OF THOSE WHO SAID MICROMAX IS BETTER, THEY ARE REALLY MISING THE GAME...HD VIDEO IN MICROMAX CUTS AT SOME MOMENT, BUT SAMSUNG PLAYS A SMOOTH VIDEO PLAYBACK. 5/5
      
      
      9. BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO GOOD IF U FOLLOW THE PROCESS I MENTIONED..4.5/5...BUT DO REMEMBER EVEN IF BUY A S4 OR S3 STILL THE BATTERY LIFE IS SAME AS THIS MOBILE...
      
      
      10. CAMERA IS AWESOME AND 8 MEGAPIXELA AND I DID OBSERVE THAT AT LOW LIGHT CONDITION THE CAMERA IS LITTLE NOT TO MY EXPECTATION..WELL I CANT BLAME TO SAMSUNG, BCOZ I DO HAVE A 14MPX CAMERA FROM CANON AND I OBESERVE THE SAME THERE...SO ITS NORMAL..4.5/5
      
      
      11. PRICE IS WELL ENOUGH FOR ITS FEATURES..AND I AM PROUD TO BE A OWNER OF THIS MOBIE.
      
      
      &GT;&GT;&GT;REMEMBER ITS WASTE TO COMPARE A CHINESE OR LOW HARDWARE MADE MOBILE WITH SAMSUNG GRAND, BCOZ I HAVE OBSERVED THE DIFFERENCES"
Galaxy Grand,5,"WELL EVEN I HAD READ ALL THE REVIEWS FROM FLIPKART AND HAD JUST ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT NOT BUYING THIS PHONE, BUT THEN I WENT TO A SAMSUNG SHOP AND TESTED IT OUT. YOU PEOPLE COMPARE IT TO A MICROMAX CANVAS, ITS WAY BETTER THAN THE CANVAS I HAVE USED 2 MICROMAX PHONES TILL NOW AND IT DID NOT LIVE UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS AND BEFORE U ASK ME TO USE THE CANVAS I ACTUALLY DID TEST IT. STILL I FOUND THIS ONE WAY BETTER.
      
      
      THE SCREEN IS A BIT OF A TURN DOWN, BUT SURPRISINGLY BECAUSE OF SAMSUNGS PIXEL OVER PIXEL TECHNOLOGY IT DOES A LOT OF JUSTICE TO THE MONEY SPENT.
      
      IT IS A PRETTY FAST DEVICE AND PLAYS ALL THE GAMES I HAVE THROWN AT IT, IT EVEN HAS A GOOD QUADRANT BENCHMARK SCORE.
      
      
      EVERYTHING WORKS VERY WELL ON THIS PHONE AND IT EVEN LOOKS NICE.
      
      
      SO THOSE WHO SAY MICROMAX IS BETTER, PLEASE GO OUT USE A PHONE WHICH IS NOT IN SOME STORE BECAUSE THE PHONES ON DISPLAY THERE ARE USED BY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO DOWNLOAD SHIT APPS AND FILL UP THE INTERNAL MEMORY, USE THE PHONE OF ONE OF YOUR FRIEND AND SEE THE DIFFERENCE :)"
Galaxy Grand,5,"WHOEVER IS PLANNIN ON BUYING THIS PHONE THEN PLS GO AHEAD...
      
      ITS AS GOOD AS A NOTE2 EXCEPT FOR A FEW FEATURES
      
      ITS WORTH ITS PRICE
      
      AND IF U HAV A CONFUSION BETWEEN GRAND AND CANVAS OR ANY OTHER PHONE OF ITS LEVEL THEN GRAND IS TA BEST!!
      
      THE WEBSITES SAY TA DISPLAY IS BAD BUT ITS REALLY GOOD
      
      DOESNT HANG!
      
      PRETTY FAST
      
      VERY COMPATIBLE AND HANDY
      
      WORTH THE BUT
      
      COMPARED TO CANVAS AND AL ANYDAY GRAND IS BETTER NOT ONLY BCOZ OF ITS BRAND BUT BCOZ OF ITS PERFRMANCE!!
      
      CHEERS ;)"
Galaxy Grand,5,"YOU ARE READING THE REVIEW COZ YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT BUYING THIS OR SOME OTHER DEVICE. BELIEVE ME, THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR!
      
      
      I FIRST USED MICROMAX CANVAS HD, I GOT REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE PHONE, I WAS ABOUT TO BUY IT BUT THEN.......
      
      
      I REALIZED, IF YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT A BRAND, DON'T VISIT ITS STORE, GO VISIT ITS SERVICE CENTER! I DID THAT FOR MICROMAX, IT WAS HORRIBLE! THE SERVICE STATION HAD HORRIBLE PEOPLE AND HORRIBLE SERVICE QUALITY!
      
      
      THEN I TRIED GRAND AT A STORE AND I BOUGHT IT FROM FLIPKART. AFTER USING GRAND... I REALLY WANT TO CLEAR SOME THINGS-
      
      1) SCREEN IS AWESOME! PUT A MATTE FINISH SCREEN GUARD AND YOU ARE DONE!
      
      2) IT HAS ALL THE SMART FEATURES LIKE IN S3 (MOTION FEATURES, SMART FEATURES AND S VOICE)
      
      3) 50GB OF DROPBOX SPACE IS AMAZING!
      
      
      JUST GO FOR IT, ITS VALUE FOR MONEY
      
      NEVER EVER COMPARE SAMSUNG WITH ANY LOCAL BRAND..
      
      
      AND LASTLY, FLIPKART, THIS IS NOT GOOD. THE PRICE HAS DROPPED, I CALLED THE FLIPKART CUSTOMER CARE A DAY BEFORE BUYING THIS DEVICE TO KNOW IF THE PRICE WILL FURTHER DROP OR NOT, THEY SAID THEY HAD NO INFORMATION ON THIS. BUT NOW IT HAS DROPPED 1K! I AM NOT HAPPY. BUT STILL DELIVERY WAS GOOD, WILL KEEP BUYING :) CHEERS!"
Galaxy Grand,4,"A DECENT PHONE WITH VERY NICE FEATURES.. PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE DISPLAY RESOLUTION !! IT'S NOTHING,,,,, QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD THANKS TO SAMSUNG.. IF YOU ARE SO TENSED WITH YOUR DISPLAY RESOLUTION THEN TRY TO DO LITTLE BIT CUSTOMIZATION BY YOUR OWN... LIKE FONT SIZE AND ALSO DOWNLOAD GOOD FONTS... NOW MY PHONE LOOKS AWESOME..  NO MORE PIXALATION PROBLEM... DISPLAY RESOLUTION IS VERY GOOD WHAT WAS I LOOKING FOR... I LOVED IT...
      
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD SPECIALLY THE PANORAMA MODE... LOVED IT....
      
      
      GAMING IS AWESOME... NO LAGS WITH ANY KIND OF GAME... LOVED IT
      
      
      USER INTERFACE IS PRETTY GOOD.... LOVED IT
      
      
      BATTERY IS OK... BUT SAME AS ALL SMARTPHONES.. HEAVY USERS WILL GET UP-TO 6-8HRS  AND NORMAL USERS WILL GET A FULL DAY, SOMETIMES MORE THAN THAT..... OK WITH IT
      
      
      ITS NOT A SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY BUT A GOOD DISPLAY WITH GOOD VIEWING ANGLE... IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER THEN IT'S A BEST SMART PHONE AVAILABLE FOR YOU AS PER MY OPINION.. ULTIMATE DECISION IS OBVIOUSLY ON YOU, FULFILLING YOUR NEEDS... THIS PHONE IS DEFINITELY PERFECT FOR A BEGINNER OR A NORMAL USERS...
      
      
      AM HAPPY WITH MY PHONE....
      
      LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST THANKS TO FLIPKART...."
Galaxy Grand,4,"A GREAT BUYING EXPERIENCE - AS I RECIEVED MY PRODUCT, THE NEXT DAY AFTER PLACING MY ORDER. I MYSELF NEVER IMAGINED A DELIVERY SO FAST!!! THE PRODUCT WAS IN GREAT CONDITION.
      
      
      ABOUT SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND, ITS A GREAT PHONE AT A GREAT PRICE (I BOUGHT THIS PHONE WITH 15% CASHBACK OFFER). AND THAT TOO COMES WITH SAMSUNG GUARANTEE. TO BE HONEST I WAS CONFUSED BETWEEN MICROMAX CANVAS HD AND GALAXY GRAND - AS CANVAS HD IS FULLY LOADED AS COMPARED TO GRAND - BUT WHEN MICROMAX INCREASED THE PRICE OF CANVAS HD AFTER ITS INITIAL LAUNCH SUCCESS AND THE PRICE DIFFERENCE NARROWED DOWN TO SUB 4000 BUCKS I CHOOSE GRAND BECAUSE OF ITS SERVICEABILITY.
      
      
      THERE IS A HANG ISSUE WITH GRAND BUT ITS NOT THAT OFTEN AND I AM KIND OF OKAY WITH THAT. I AM USING THIS PH SINCE 15 DAYS AND IT HANGED ONLY 2 OR 3 TIMES AND THAT TOO WHEN I OPEN MULTIPLE HEAVYWEIGHT APPS. SO THAT'S OKAY. REST EVERYTHING IS COOL. I AM EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH MY BUY... HOPE THIS HELPS...!!!"
Galaxy Grand,4,"AFTER 3MONTH'S OF USING THIS PHONE I AM WRITING THE REVIEW FOR THIS ONE.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      GOOD LOOKING WITH DUAL SIM PHONE
      
      BIG IN SCREEN SIZE WITH DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND 1GB OF RAM
      
      YOU CAN WATCH ALL HD MOVIES
      
      YOU CAN PLAY ALMOST EVERY GAMES
      
      SUPPORTS MAXIMUM APPS.
      
      LAG PROBLEM IS LESS COMPARED TO OTHER SAMSUNG PHONES
      
      
      CONS:
      
      OVERALL THIS PHONE IS GOOD IF YOU ARE NOT A GAMER THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE THINKING OF PLAYING GAMES ON THIS MOBILE THEN IT WILL USE UR MAXIMUM BATTERY LIFE AND IT WILL LAST FOR MAX 3-4 HRS IF FULLY CHARGED.
      
      IT ALSO TAKES A LONG TIME TO FULLY CHARGE THE BATTERY."
Galaxy Grand,4,"AWESOME PHONE. TOTALLY WORTH THE DOUGH AND EVEN MORE ACTUALLY, THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE BATTERY LIFE, WHICH DRAINS REAL QUICKLY. IF SAMSUNG CAN MAKE A BETTER BATTERY FOR THIS IT WOULD BE A KILLER COMBO !"
Galaxy Grand,4,"BATTERY BACKUP GOOD
      
      DISPLAY CLARITY NOT SO GOOD
      
      BETTER SOUND FOR HEARING SONGS

      MARIGINED PRICE TAG
      
      MODERATE WEIGHT
      
      EXCELLENT SCREEN SIZE
      
      GOOD STORAGE SIZE
      
      OVERALL 4-OUT-OF-FIVE"
Galaxy Grand,4,"BOUGHT THIS ON FLIPKART BOUT A MONTH BACK FOR 18K APOX. ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS A FRIEND BOUGHT MICROMAX CANVAS HD. I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR A MONTH NOW. HERE'S MY OPINION.
      
      
      WHILE NOT IN THE SAME BALL PARK AS A S3. IT GETS THE JOB DONE FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE. MORE THAN SUFFICIENT CHIP, RAM AND PROCESSING POWER FOR THE AVERAGE ENTERTAINMENT USER. THE MUCH MALIGNED SCREEN IS MORE THAN DECENT. PIXELATION IS VISIBLE BUT ONLY ON CLOSE INSPECTION. CASUAL GAMERS WILL FIND THE PERFORMANCE ADEQUATE. HEAVY GAMERS WILL FIND IT A LIL LAGGY. THE REASON BEING IT DOES NOT SUPPORT APP2SD. ALL APPS ARE STORED ON THE INTERNAL MEMORY WHICH SLOWS PERFORMANCE. EXCELLENT CAMERA. WHAT REALLY SWEETENS THE DEAL IS 50GB DROPBOX SPACE. ALL MY PICS ARE UPLOADED TO CLOUD SO NO WORRIES OF SYSTEM CRASHES OR LOST PHONES. ALSO THE SAMSUNG APPS ARE AWESOME.  NIFTY STUFF LIKE SMART STAY (SCREEN NOT DIMMING AS LONG AS UR LOOKING AT IT), MULTI WINDOW (SIMULTANEOUSLY USING TWO APPS TOGETHER EG WATCH MOVE N TEXT)..ECT MAKE THE PREMIUM THAT YOU PAY FOR THE SAMSUNG BRAND WORTH IT. I FEEL THAT THOU CANVAS HD OFFERS A GR8 SCREEN AND COSTS LESS. THE GRAND MAKES UP WITH MORE INTERNAL MEMORY. SAMSUNG APPS, BETTER CAMERA, DROPBOX STORAGE N A BETTER BATTERY. PLUS PAYING EXTRA FOR THE SAMSUNG HAS 2 ADDITIONAL BENEFITS.
      
      1) I FEEL SAMSUNG IS A MORE PREMIUM BRAND WHERE AS MICROMAX IS AN ECONOMY BRAND. I FEEL BETTER WHIPPING OUT MY PHONE IN A CROWDED BAR.
      
      2) TECH GETS OUTDATED FAST AND IN A FEW MONTHS I PLAN TO SELL OFF THE GRAND AND UPGRADE. AND I KNOW THAT I CAN SELL IT FOR A DECENT PRICE AND FIND BUYER'S EASILY."
Galaxy Grand,4,"EVERYONE IS NOW COMPARING SAMSUNG WITH MICROMAX AND I WAS ALSO ONE AMOUNG THEM. BUT AFTER GOING THROUGH A REVIEW PROCESS FINALLY SELECTED SAMSUNG. THIS PHONE IS AWESOME IN ITS RANGE. THE FEATURES ARE TOO GOOD AND THE DISPLAY IS ENJOYABLE.DIDN'T FIND MUCH ISSUE WITH THE 480 X 800 PIXEL RESOLUTION DISPLAY.
      
      
      IT HAS GOT A GOOD BATTERY BACK-UP AND SUGGEST USING WIFI WHERE EVER POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO HAVE A LONG BATTERY BACK-UP. THE MOBILE DATA OPTION WILL SIMPLE EAT AWAY THE BATTERY BACKUP. THE AUDIO QUALITY IS VERY GOOD AND THE 2 MP FRONT CAMERA IS GOOD FOR VIDEO CHAT. THIS PHONE HAS PROBLEM WITH GPRS SETTINGS AND IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO CONFIGURE IT MAY HAVE TO TAKE HELP OF SOME EXPERT OR HAVE TO VISIT THE NEAREST SERVICE CENTRE. IT TOOK A DAY FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND IT AND HAVE WASTED MY TIME IN SHOUTING AT THE MOBILE SERVICE PROVIDER.
      
      
      NO MUCH PROBLEMS OTHER THAN THIS AND RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO TRY THIS OUT."
Galaxy Grand,4,"EXCELLENT FEATURED MOBILE.
      
      GOOD PERFORMANCE IN MULTI-TASKING.
      
      CAN GIVE A MAX OF 1 DAY BATTERY BACKUP WITH BEST USAGE.
      
      
      COMPETITIVE PRICE COMPARED TO OTHER ONLINE STORES.
      
      NICE DEAL IN FILPKART WITH ADDED FREEBIES."
Galaxy Grand,4,"FIRST OF TNX TO FLIPKART FOR THERE ROCKING PACKAGE AND QUICK DELIVERY WITHIN 2 DAYS....
      
      
      BUT I M LITTLE DIS-APPOINT BCZ THE THE DAY I PURCHASED THAT THAT IT COST 19.5K BUT THE NEXT ITS PRICE WAS 5%DISCOUNT SO I LOST 1K APPROX..
      
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PHONE, ITS A NICE WORK BY SAMSUNG...
      
      PH SPEED, CAMERA, HANDY AND GRT OTHER FEATHERS ARE MARVELOUS ... I AM ENJOYING THE PHONE...
      
      
      FULL HD PHOTO, VEDIO AND A LOTS OF THING.... HV THIS AND SEE THE MAGIC...."
Galaxy Grand,4,"FLIPKART'S SERVICE IS EXCELLENT. WITHIN 24 HOURS OF ORDERING I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT EVEN THOUGH THEY INDICATED 3-4 BUSINESS DAYS IN THEIR SITE.PACKING WAS VERY GOOD. COMPONENTS IN THE PRODUCT WERE ALSO ORIGINAL. IT IS A RELIABLE SITE FOR ONLINE PURCHASE.
      
      
      GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.
      
      THE PRODUCT IS LITTLE HEAVY AND DOES NOT FIT INTO POCKET. DURATION OF BATTERY CHARGE IS VERY LESS(NOT EVEN ONE DAY)."
Galaxy Grand,4,"GOOD LOOKING PHONE,  SCREEN SIZE IS HUGE WHICH MAKE IT TO LOOK LIKE S3.
      
      
      SAME PHONE IS NOW IN MARKET FOR EBAY LESS IN PRICE. MY FRIEND SHOWED AFTER I RECEIVED :-(
      
      
      BOTH MEMORY CARD AND PHONE WAS SHIPPED DIFFERENTLY, WHICH MADE ME PISSED OF ON FLIPCART"
Galaxy Grand,4,"GOOD PHONE WITH LARGE SCREEN. ITS OK IF YOUR USAGE IS NORMAL AND RESTRICTED TO FEW SIMPLE GAMES, CALLS AND MESSAGES. BUT IF YOU START DOWNLOADING HD GAMES OR VIDEOS OR FEW MULTITASKING, IT STARTS TO HANG A LOT.
      
      
      BUT THE FLIPKART SERVICE WAS AS USUAL, THE BEST. PHONE REACHED IN 3 BUSINESS DAYS."
Galaxy Grand,4,"GOT THIS PHONE A WEEK BACK TO REPLACE A SAMSUNG WAVE III AND EXPERIA SOLA, MUST SAY THAT THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SATISFACTORY TILL DATE. A LOT HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE DISPLAY BUT BELIEVE ME - I WOULD CONSIDER THIS AT PAR WITH WAVE III AND EXPERIA WITH ITS BRAVIA ENGINE. THE UI IS SUPER SMOOTH AND FAST - I HAVE A HOST OF MAILS SERVICES AND OTHER THINGS RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND WITH ABSOLUTELY NO HICCUPS OR ANY LAG WHAT SO EVER. I AM A HEAVY USER OF 3G AND THE RESULTS THAT I GET FROM SPEEDTEST.NET HAS ME SURPRISED - I AM AVERAGING 3.1 - 3.2 MBPS WHERE AS THE SAME CONNECTING IN MY EARLIER DEVICES NEVER RAN MORE THAN 2 MBPS. IT IS NOT AS BIG AS NOTE AND CAN BE CONVENIENTLY CARRIED IN YOUR TROUSER POCKET. IT HAS NEARLY ALL THE FEATURES AVAILABLE IN A MUCH EXPENSIVE MODEL LIKE NOTE2 EXCEPT THE S PEN.
      
      I CAN NOT COMMENT ABOUT MICROMAX BUT I BELIEVE IT IS A DUAL BAND PHONE AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO CARRY IT ALL OVER THE WORLD.
      
      IN MY OPINION RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE BEST DUAL SIM PHONE AVAILABLE THAT I CAN USE OUTSIDE INDIA AS WELL.
      
      
      THE ONLY THING THAT I BELIEVE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IS THE BATTERY - HEAVY USAGE DRAINS THE BATTERY IN 8 -10 HRS."
Galaxy Grand,4,"HAVE BOUGHT IT ON CASH BACK OFFER AT 18.2K
      
      
      DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE. MICROMAX HD - COMPLAINTS ABOUT SOFTWARE BUGS AND ALSO WITH LOW SERVICE QUALITY.
      
      
      I HAVE DOWNLOADED ALMOST 300 APPS AND THE PHONE IS SMOOTH DESPITE MANY APPS OPERATING
      
      
      AS PROS ARE ALREADY KNOWN, FEW CONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
      
      
      1. TRANSFER OF APPS TO SD CARD IS NOT POSSIBLE AS OF NOW. SO HIGH MB GAMES UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T GEL WELL.
      
      
      2. IF YOU ARE USING INTERNET ON SIM 2 NO APP WILL MEASURE THE USAGE. INTERNET USAGE WILL ONLY BE MEASURED ON SIM 1
      
      
      3. VODAFONE FREE OFFER OF 2G &AMP; 3G INTERNET DOESN'T WORK. ALREADY THEIR 3G IS NOT PERMITTED FOR NEW SIMS IN MANY CIRCLES. THE 2G FREE OFFER ALSO DOESN'T WORK AND THE VODAFONE CALL CENTRE DOESNT RESPOND.
      
      
      4.ITS VERY HARD TO OPERATE WITH ONE HAND
      
      
      5.GRAND QUATTRO IS PRICED AT 16570 !
      
      
      DESPITE THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO TRANSFER APPS TO SD CARD, REST ALL ARE ACCEPTABLE. HOPE SAMSUNG COMES UP WITH A SOLUTION."
Galaxy Grand,4,"HELLO EVERYONE,
      
      
      I CAME ACROSS THIS PHONE FROM ONE OF MY FRIEND WHO EXPLAINED IT EACH AND EVERY AMAZING FEATURE. THEN ITSELF I DECIDED TO GET ONE OF THIS FOR MYSELF..
      
      
      THESE ARE THE OBSERVATIONS BY ME AFTER USING THIS FOR A MONTH.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      ALL THE FEATURES ARE COOL.
      
      
      THE MUSIC-PLAYING QUALITY IS HIGHLY WORTH-NOTICING EVEN WHEN PLAYED THROUGH MUSIC SYSTEM AND HEADPHONES.
      
      
      THE CAMERA IS SO GOOD THAT IT CAN CLEARLY TAKE HIGH QUALITY PICTURES WITHOUT ANY TIME-DELAY. RECORDING VIDEO IS FUN.
      
      
      THE TOUCH WORKS SO PERFECTLY THAT WE CAN SURF THROUGH THE MOBILE WITHIN NO TIME.
      
      AND THE SCREEN SIZE IS VERY GREAT FOR VIEWING VIDEOS AND PICTURES. EVEN THE 1080P VIDEOS ARE BEING PLAYED VERY SMOOTHLY (EVEN IN THE MINIMISED MODE).
      
      
      THE FRONT CAM ALSO HAS A GREAT QUALITY OUTPUT THAN MANY BIG SMART PHONES.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      ANYWAY, I'M LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE UI THAT IS PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG FOR CALLING AND MESSAGING.
      
      
      THE PHONE APP (WHICH IS USED TO MAKE CALLS) LACKS SOME OF THE BASIC FEATURES LIKE VIEWING LAST DIALED NUMBERS WHEN IT IS IN THE DIALER MODE, ONE HAS TO MOVE TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AN PRESS 'CALL LOG' FOR VIEWING THEM. THE PRESENTATION OF THE LISTS IS ALSO A BIT MORE HISTORIC.
      
      
      I DONNO WHY THE 'CALL LOG' RECORDS THE HISTORY OF INCOMING AND OUTGOING MESSAGES, MAKING THE CALL LOG PAGE A BIT MORE HEAVILY LOADED. ALSO, IT DOESNT GROUP THE LOGGED ENTRIES, EACH LOG MAKES A NEW ENTRY IN THE 'CALL LOG' PAGE. (FOR EXAMPLE, IF I MADE SUCCESSIVELY 10 CALLS TO THE SAME PERSON, IT RECORDS AS 10 ENTRIES INSTEAD OF GROUPING).
      
      
      COMING TO THE MESSAGING PART, THE TEXT EDITOR HAS NO T9 MODE. IT DOESN'T CHECK FOR SPELLING MISTAKES EVEN IN ENGLISH. THE INTERFACE FOR TYPING AND SELECTING TEXT ARE NOT WELL DESIGNED. (NO SETTINGS FOR VIBRATION FEEDBACK WHILE TYPING EACH ALPHABET OVER KEYPAD)
      
      
      SO, OVERALL CONCLUSION IS THAT- THIS MOBILE IS ENRICHED WITH MANY NEW FEATURES, BUT I FEEL SAMSUNG FAILED TO UPDATE ITS OWN VERSION RELATED TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE MOBILE.
      
      ANYWAY, THESE CALLER AND MESSAGING FUNCTIONALITIES CAN BE SUBSTITUTED BY APPS FROM PLAY STORE.
      
      
      (I WAS PREVIOUSLY A HTC MOBILE USER AND THESE CALLING AND MESSAGING FUNCTIONALITIES ARE EXCELLENTLY DESIGNED IN HTC, AND THAT IS WHAT MADE ME FEEL THIS...)
      
      
      FINALLY, I WISH TO SAY THAT IF U R ACCUSTOMED WITH THE INTERFACE PROVIDED FOR SAMSUNG FOR CALLING AND MSG'ING, THEN THIS IS A VERY GOOD CHOICE OF MOBILE IN THIS PRICE RANGE..."
Galaxy Grand,4,"HELLO PEOPLE I HAD PURCHASED GRAND DUOS FROM FLIPKART AT THE TIME IT WAS JUST LAUNCHED..
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME.. AND I BELIEVE ITS A GOOD PHONE.. 1.2GHZ DUAL CORE 1 GB RAM IS A PRETTY DESENT CONFIGURATION FOR ALMOST ALL YOUR DAILY TASKS. IT ACTUALLY HANDLES ALMOST EVERY ESSENTIAL APP VERY EFFICIENTLY.. YOU DONT HAVE LAGS AND DONT HAVE TO OFTEN RESTART THE PHONE. WITH SOME MINOR TWEAKS YOU CAN HAVE AN ANTUTU BENCHMARK SCORE OF 8500+.
      
      
      **NOW MANY BELIEVE THAT ~180 PIXEL DENSITY WILL MAKE FOR A VERY BAD DISPLAY IN TERMS OF RESOLUTION.. BUT THE DISPLAY INFACT LOOKS VERY GOOD. THERE IS NO OBSERVABLE PIX-ELATION THE 5INCH SCREEN IS BRIGHT HAS GREAT VIEWING ANGLES AND BRIGHT.
      
      
      **ABOUT HD GAMING.. I PLAYED NOVA 3,GTA VICE CITY AND MOSTWANTED... IT JUS PLAYS THESE GAMES SUPERB EVEN BETTER THAN MANY OTHER EXPENSIVE PHONES..
      
      (THE REASON IS IT PLAYS GAMES ON A LESS RESOLUTION IE QVGA AND FOR THAT REASON 1.2GHZ PROCESSOR WITH 1 GIG RAM IS PRETTY MUCH FINE) THE BROADCOM VIDEOCORE 4 GPU IS NEW AS COMPARED TO SAMSUNGS CONVENTIONAL CHOICE OF MALI 400MP'S.!!! BUT STILL YOU WILL BE CONVINCED. AND PS CONTRARY TO THE MYTH SUBWAY SURFERS WORKS ON GRAND WITHOUT ANY HASSLE.
      
      
      **THE BATTERY ON THE PHONE HOWEVER FALLS HORT LASTS 8 HOURS ON DUAL SIM AND 3G NET.. BUT THATS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO WITH.
      
      AND PS IF YOU WANT A GAMING DEVICE GO FOR PHONES HAVING NVIDIA TEGRA 3..BUT THEN A MOBILE IS NOT MEANT FOR GAMING AND GRAND BEING A DUAL SIM.. IT STILL MANAGES TO PLAY WELL!!
      
      
      ** THE DISAPPOINTING THING IS IT HAS GOT ONLY 8GB OF INTERNAL STORAGE OUT OF WHICH ONLY 4G IS AVAILABLE THAT CAN BE A CONCERN BUT AGAIN IF U CAN ROOT IT THEN YOU CAN SWAP INTERNAL TO EXTERNAL MEMORY.
      
      
      ** THE PHONE DOESN'T COME WITH A GORILLA GLASS BUT THE BUILD QUALITY IS SUPERB AND IS ALMOST SIMILAR TO NOTE 2. IT FEELS GOOD IN THE HAND AND IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE S4 THE CURRENT FLAGSHIP.
      
      
      ** I MISS HAVING AN HDMI OUT BUT THAT IS LESS REQUIRED FOR MY INTENDED PURPOSE.
      
      
      ** ABOUT THE OS.. TOUCHWIZ UI ON JELLYBEAN ITS FLUID UNLESS U MESS IT UP WID A ZILLION WIDGETS. YOU HAVE REGULAR UPDATES.. TALKING ABOUT ANDROID DEVELOPMENT ITS TAKING PACE YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF MODS TO INTEGRATE NOTE2 FEATURES AND A COUPLE OF CUSTOM ROMS.
      
      
      SO THESE ARE SOME THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE ABOUT THE GRAND.OVERALL ITS A GOOD PHONE. FLIPKART HAD GIVEN ME A GREAT COMBO DEAL WHICH MADE ME EVEN MORE HAPPY. IF YOU WANT TO PURCHASE IT GO AHEAD IT SURELY WONT DISAPPOINT YOU.
      
      
      COMPARING IT WITH MICROMAX. WELL I DONT OWN A MICROMAX SO I CANT COMMENT BUT I HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT OWNING A SAMSUNG!! =)"
Galaxy Grand,4,"HI ALL, I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART ON 18TH MARCH, 2013 &AMP; WAS EXPECTING MY ORDER BY 20TH. BUT FLIPKART GAVE ME A SWEET SURPRISE BY DELIVERING THE GRAND ON THE VERY NEXT DAY I.E, 19TH MARCH. FELT V.V.HAPPY. VERY GOOD SERVICE FROM FLIPKART CHEERS!!!!
      
      
      COMING ABOUT THE GRAND EXPERIENCE:
      
      
      THE EXPERIENCE IS SIMPLY AWESOME. FIRST OF ALL THE SCREEN WAS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE AS MANY WERE EXPECTING &AMP; COMPARING IT TO MICROMAX CANVAS HD. THE SCREEN MAY NOT BE HD BUT IT IS CLEAR &AMP; BRIGHT - GAMES, SITES, EVERYTHING LOOKS REALLY GOOD NOT AS GOOD AS AMOLED BUT DEFINETLY GOOD &AMP; NOT A DEAL BREAKER.
      
      
      COMING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CONFUSED TO BUY GRAND OVER CANVAS HD - GOOD BRANDS LIKE SAMSUNG, HTC, SE ETC USE GOOD CHIPSETS &AMP; PROCESSORS SO THE PHONES WILL NOT HEAT UP QUICKLY EVEN AFTER NICE USE OF NET, GAMES, ETC. BUT PHONES LIKE CANVAS HD &AMP; ALL THEY USE NORMAL CHIPSETS &AMP; PROCESSORS WHICH WILL CAUSE THE PHONES TO HEAT UP AFTER A CERTAIN POINT OF TIME. BELIEVE ME THIS HAPPENS A LOTTT..
      
      
      THE PROCESSOR IN GRAND IS REALLY GOOD &AMP; MULTI-TASKING IS FLUID. BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY GOOD. DON'T GO WITH THE BENCHMARK RESULTS GUYS THIS PHONE IS AWESOME. I'M A GADGET GEEK &AMP; I USE A LOT OF PHONE'S BUT WAS LOOKING FOR A NICE DUAL SIM PHONE FROM A GOOD BRAND HENCE BOUGHT THE PHONE &AMP; BELIEVE ME MANY WOULD LOVE THIS PHONE.
      
      
      NOW COMING TO THE CONS PART - ONE CANT MOVE THE APPLICATIONS FROM INTERNAL MEMORY TO SD CARD. PRICING SHOULD BE AROUND 18K. OTHERS ARE VERY NEGLIGIBLE AS COOL APPS &AMP; MOTION SENSORS WE GIVEN BY SAMSUNG.
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT: GO FOR IT GUYS!!! GRAND ROCKS."
Galaxy Grand,4,"HI ALL,
      
      
      GOT THIS PHONE IN THE MONTH OF MAY AND HAVE BEEN USING IT SINCE. BELOW ARE MY OBSERVATIONS.
      
      
      1. BATTERY LASTS FOR A DAY WITH NORMAL USAGE LIKE CALLS, SKYPE ON 3G, CAMERA .ETC. WHICH IS OK
      
      2. TOO LESS INTERNAL MEMORY AND AS A RESULT NOT MANY APPS CAN BE INSTALLED. NEED TO PURCHASE A MEMORY CARD WHICH IS EXTRA
      
      3. TIME TAKEN TO ACHIVE A 100% CHARGE IS ABOUT 2.5 HOURS WHICH I FEEL IS ON THE HIGHER SIDE
      
      
      OVERALL I WOULD SAY THAT THE PHONE IS GOOD FOR THE PRICE WE PAY. HOPE THIS MINI REVIEW IS HELPFUL.
      
      
      AS REGARDS FLIPKART IS CONCERNED I SAY THAT THEY PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE. EVEN THEIR PPL ON THE PHONE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR QUERIES ARE ANSWERED TO. I GOT THE PHONE WITHIN 3 DAYS OF ME ORDERING IT. IT CAME IN A PROPERLY SEALED OUTER PACKAGE. THE INSIDE PHONE PACKAGE WAS ALSO SEALED. HATS OFF TO FLIPKART FOR A GREAT SERVICE.
      
      
      CHEERS..."
Galaxy Grand,4,"HI HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ALMOST A MONTH NOW. THE PHONE IS EXCELLENT FOR THIS PRICE RANGE WITH ALMOST ALL FEATURES YOU CAN THINK OFF.. DUAL SIM EXPERIENCE IS SEAMLESS AND BATTERY BACK UP IS GOOD LASTS FULL DAY WITH GOOD USE. WIFI IS SMOOTH AND WITH 1GB RAM ALL APPLICATIONS WORK VERY SMOOTH ON THIS PHONE. METALLIC BLUE COLOUR IS STUNNING AND THE FLIP COVER GOT FREE WITH THIS PHONE IS OF HIGH QUALITY.. VIDEO PLAY BACK IS STUNNING WITH 16M COLOUR.. THE PHONE LAGS A BIT SOME TIMES WHEN TOO MANY APPLICATIONS ARE WORKING BUT COME ON WHICH PHONE DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM EVEN APPLE PHONES HAVE PROBLEMS..
      
      
      SO ITS JUST GO FOR IT... CHEERS !!!!!"
Galaxy Grand,4,"HI, FIRST OF ALL FLIPKART IS AWESOME FOR FAST DELIVERY &AMP; AT REASONABLE PRICES. I PLACED THE ORDER ON 12TH MARCH &AMP; THEY DELIVERED IT ON 14TH OF MARCH 2DAYS BEFORE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE. PACKAGING WAS ALSO GOOD.
      
      
      I BOUGHT IT IN COMBO OFFER WITH SAMSUNG WIRELESS HEADSET. ITS A GREAT DEAL &AMP; THE HEADSET IS AWESOME THOUGH I DIDN'T USE IT MANY :P
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PHONE. THE PHONE IS AWESOME. IT SHOULD NOT BE COMPARED WITH CANVAS HD. BOTH OF THEM HAVE SAME SPECS BUT GRAND HAS SO MANY FEATURES THAT U NEVER LEFT THE PHONE, U WILL BECOME FAN OF IT. PRO'S ALL R THE THINGS WHICH CERTIFY BUYER MENTION IN OTHER COMMENTS(I ALSO OVERVIEW SOME OF THEM). I WANT TO DRAG A CONCLUSION ON THE CON'S......
      
      
      1. BATTERY BACKUP IS REALLY POOR. IT BARELY LAST FOR ONE DAY WITH 2-3 HOURS GAMING, 2-3 HOURS INTERNET, 30MIN CALLING &AMP; PUTTING THE SCREEN IN AUTO MODE. ONLY FOR BATTERY I M GIVING IT 4 STARS. THOUGH U CANT EXPECT MORE FROM THIS PRICE... :D
      
      2. EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT ITS DISPLAY. I WANT TO SAY THAT ITS GOOD. SAMSUNG MANAGE THE PIXELATION VERY WELL IN THIS PHONE THAT THE WVGA DISPALY WONT BOTHER U... BUT THE ISSUE IS FADE SCREEN. SOMETIME AUTOMATICALLY THE SCREEN FADE( MAYBE ONCE IN A DAY OR 2) WHEN IT WAS IN AUTO MODE, WHICH SAMSUNG FIXED BY LATEST FIRMWARE UPDATE (YESTERDAY'S UPDATE). NOW NO MORE COMPLAIN REGARDING FADE SCREEN.
      
      
      PRO'S ARE---
      
      1. UTTERLY BUTTERLY SMOOTH PHONE. GREAT CPU PERFORMANCE.  SCREEN TOUCH N GAMING EXPERIENCE IS AWESOME.
      
      2. SO MUCH OF RAM AVAILABLE IF U R NOT INSTALLING MANY APPS &AMP; INTERNAL STORAGE IS ALSO HUGE  FOR ME.
      
      3. CAMERA IS FABULOUS &AMP; COMAPREABLE WITH NOTE 2 AS IT HAS ALL FEATURE OF NOTE 2 CAMERA.
      
      4. FEW MOTION WHICH ARE THE INVENTION OF SAMSUNG ARE GREAT.
      
      5. SCREEN IS GOOD FOR STUDY E-BOOK WHICH IS MY MAIN NEED &AMP; ITS SATISFY ME.
      
      6. MULTITASKING IS REALLY A GREAT FEATURE WHICH SAMSUNG ADD ON THIS PHONE. U CAN MESSAGE, SURF NET, CHECK UR EMAIL FROM A SINGLE 5 INCH SCREEN.
      
      
      IF U ARE A MODERATE USER &AMP; A BUDGET OF 20-25 K BLINDLY GO FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND. ITS REALLY GRAND!!!!!"
Galaxy Grand,4,"HI,
      
      
      VERY USEFUL INFORMATION SHARED BY SOME GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET ME SHARE MINE.
      
      
      I GOT THIS PHONE SOON AFTER RELEASING THE OFFER OR 15% CASH BACK.
      
      
      MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS IS TOO GOOD EXCEPT SOME PROBLEMS.
      
      
      IF I KEEP THIS PHONE IDLE FOR A LONG TIME (5 TO 6 HRS), SOMETIMES, IT GETS SWITCHED OFF AUTOMATICALLY AND THE POWER BUTTON STOPS WORKING. I HAVE TO REMOVE BACK COVER AND RESET THE BATTERY TO SWITCH ON. THIS HAPPENED THRICE IN 7 DAYS. WHEN I CALLED THE SUPPORT TEAM OF SAMSUNG, I CAME TO KNOW THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM OF SOFTWARE UPDATES. EVEN AFTER UPDATING THE SOFTWARE WITH THE HELP OF 3G INTERNET SERVICE, IT HAPPENED ONCE. I AM WAITING TO HAPPEN IT FOR THE 4TH TIME SO THAT I CAN CARRY THE PHONE TO SERVICE CENTER TO SHOW THE SITUATION.
      
      
      SOME TIMES IT HANGS. IF YOU USE A HD LIVE WALLPAPER, THE SYSTEM WORKS VERY SLOW.
      
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS BAD. I SHOULD SAY.
      
      
      APART FROM THE ABOVE ISSUES, I HAVE NOT FACED ANY OTHER PROBLEMS YET."
Galaxy Grand,4,I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE PHONE BUT WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED COS FLIPKART PROMISED TO DELIVER IT BY THE 4TH OF APRIL AND DID SO ONLY ON THE 8TH... BUT OTHERWISE THE PHONE IS KICKASS.. TOALLY WORTH EVERY PENNY. FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A MID RANGE PHONE U CANNOT GET A BETTER DEAL... BRILLIANT PROCESSOR.. THE PHONE'S REALLY FAST... THERE ARE NO PROBS WITH THE RESOLUTION AS IS THE COMMON NOTION.. ITS EVERYTHING U CAN WANT!!!
Galaxy Grand,4,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR THE PAST ONE MONTH. IT IS GOOD PHONE EXCEPT THAT THERE IS LAG IN ITS RESPONSE FOR ANY OPERATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU OPEN A APP, IT WILL TAKE FEW SECONDS TO OPEN IT.. THE DISPLAY IS OK.  BEST PHONE IN DUAL SIM CATEGORY."
Galaxy Grand,4,"I AM USING THIS PHONE SINCE 14 DAYS.ACCORDING TO PHONES PERFORMANCE ITS VERY GOOD BETTER THAN EXPECTED. I HAVE DOWNLOAD AROUND 60-70 APPS.GAMES LIKE DEAD TRIGGER, TEMPLE RUN 1-2, FRONTLINE COMMANDO, BLOOD &AMP; GLOORY ETC.IT PLAYS BUTTERLY THERE IS NO LAG IN GAMING. OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD &AMP; BEST AMONG ALL MIDRANGE PHONE CATEGORY. I PERSONALLY LOVE SAMSUNGS TOUCHWIZ UI, IT GIVES USERS MORE OPTIONS TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR PHONE.MY  FREIND HAS MMX A116 WITH STOCK UI, ACCORDING TO ME GRAND  IS MORE COMFORTABLE TO USE (SOFTWARE WISE).THOUGH MMX A116 IS SIMPLY GOOD, NOT LIKE GRAND.I HAVE CHECKED MANY REVIEWS MENTIONING THAT GRAND DISPLAY IS NOT VERY GOOD.BUT WHEN PHONE COMES TO MY HAND I REALIZE THAT ITS DISPLAY IS QUITE GOOD &AMP; COLORS ARE VIBRANT.I LIKE SAM'S APPS, MULTIWINDOW, POP UP PLAYER.
      
      THERE ARE SOME CONS ALSO:
      
      1) SOMETIMES GOOGLE PLAY STORE STOPPED WORKING CRASHES 4-5 TIMES.
      
      2) BATTERY LIFE IS AROUND 14-15 HOURS IN SINGLE CHARGE.
      
      3) ITS INTERNAL MEMORY AVAILABILITY FROM 8 GB I GET ONLY 4.04 GB THOUGH ITS ENOUGH.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1) GRAND PERFORMANCE.
      
      2) RICH SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE BETTER THAN ALL STOCK RUNNING PHONES LIKE MMX A116, XOLO, KARBONN ETC.
      
      3)CAMERAS PERFORMANCE IS QUITE WELL.
      
      
      SO , SAMMY HAS DONE VERY GOOD JOB BY BRINGING  ALMOST ALL S3 &AMP;NOTE 2 FEATURE IN LESSER PRICE.I'LL RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.ITSGR8 BUY.
      
      FIRMWARE VERSION : I9082XXXAMD1"
Galaxy Grand,4,"I BOUGHT IT 10 DAYS AGO ITS THE BEST PHONE IT WORKS SUPER FINE, GREAT CAMERA, SUPER FAST GAMING, MULTI-TASKING IS EASY THE ONLY THING IS ITS A LIL HEAVY BESIDE THAT THERE IS EVERYTHING IN THIS PHONE THAT U CAN ASK FOR. PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT ITS LOW RESOLUTION DONT WORRY ABOUT IT. I BARELY NOTICED THAT THING EVER SCREEN IS SUPER FINE. THOSE WHO CANT AFFORD BUYING S3 &AMP; S4 CAN OPT FOR THIS GRAND.
      
      
      I ORDERED IT IN FLIPKART ON 21ST APRIL BY 22ND APRIL IT IS IN MY HANDS.. FLIPKART PACKING AND DELEVERY IS SO FAST.."
Galaxy Grand,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2 WEEKS BACK AND OBSERVED PHONE AUDIO THRU EAR PHONE WAS NOT WORKING. THEN I WENT TO SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT, PROBLEM WITH AUDIO JACK AND SHOULD BE REPLACED. THEN I CALLED FLIP KART CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND INFORMED THEM ABOUT THE DEFECT. IMMEDIATELY, THEY HAVE SENT REPLACEMENT MOBILE.
      
      
      THANK YOU SO MUCH FLIP KART.
      
      
      CONS : SOME TIME IT IS SLOW EVEN IF U TRY TO OPEN CONTACTS, REST ALL LOOKS FINE FOR ME"
Galaxy Grand,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART ON 4TH APRIL.
      
      I HAVE READ SO MANY REVIEWS OF PEOPLE GIVING 'EXCELLENT' RATING TO FLIPKART SERVICE. HOWEVER, I HAD MY WORST EXPERIENCE WITH FLIPKART DELIVERY SERVICE ON THIS ORDER.
      
      BEING A RESIDENT OF DELHI, AND ORDER BEING SHIPPED FROM NOIDA (PART OF NCR), IT TOOK FLIPKART ALMOST 5 DAYS TO COVER THIS DISTANCE OF BARELY 25 KMS???!! MOREOVER, THEIR SELF-ESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE WAS 8TH APRIL, WHEREAS, ON NOT RECEIVING THE DELIVERY TILL 8TH APRIL 1600 HRS ALSO, I HAD TO CALL THEIR CUSTOMER CARE TO EXPEDITE THE DELIVERY. FINALLY, GOT DELIVERED ON 9TH APR- NOON TIME.
      
      BTW THIS WAS PURCAHSED AS GIFT FOR MY WIFE, AND PEOPLE WHO ARE MARRIED WOULD BE ABLE TO RELATE HOW EMBARRASING IT GETS WHEN YOU CAN'T MANAGE TO HONOUR A GIFT ON RIGHT DAY &AMP; TIME..!!!
      
      HOPE IT'S AN EYE OPENER FOR ALL THOSE WHO SWEAR BY FLIPKARTS SERVICE.
      
      
      NOW COMING TO THE HANDSET; WELL IT'S A PRETTY DECENT HANDSET, EXCEPT ONLY FOR ITS BATTERY PERFORMANCE, AS THE CHARGING TIME IS HIGH, AND THE BATTERY DOESN'T LAST TOO LONG EVEN ON IN-BUILT POWER SAVING MODE. IT DOESNT LAST EVEN A DAY WITH EVEN MODERATE USE, SAY 30-45 MINS OF BROWSING, 20-30 MINUTES OF VIDEO STREAMING (3G), 3 HR OF TALKTIME, PROBABLY 30-45 MINS OF GAMING AND SOME WHATS APP CHATTING &AMP; SHARING. I THINK THAT'S QUITE MODERATE USAGE.
      
      APPARENTLY, TO SUPPORT SUCH USE ALSO,I HAD TO INSTALL BATTERY SAVER APPLICATION, SO THAT IT LASTS A FULL DAY.
      
      OTHER THAN THIS, ALL FEATURES ARE GOOD. CAMERA IS QUITE OKAY, THOUGH YOU CANNOT COMPARE IT WITH A 8MP SONY OR IPHONE CAMERA. JELLY BEAN IS VERY SMOOTH, NO LAGS FOUND IN BROWSING/ MULTI-TASKING. MULTIPLE WINDOW FEATURE, PARTICULARLY FOR VIDEO VIEWING IS GOOD.
      
      ALSO, DUAL STAND-BY OF TWO SIMS (FORWARDING OF CALL TO OPERATIONAL SIM) WORKS WELL IN THIS HANDSET, WHICH IN MOST HANDSETS DOESN'T REALLY WORKS, AND PROMPTS THE CALLER THAT THE NUMBER IS NOT REACHABLE.
      
      HAVE UPGRADED ROM THROUGH A 32 GB UHS MICRO CARD, WHICH IS WORKING PERFECTLY FINE.
      
      OVERALL I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS PHONE 4 OUT OF 5. 1 POINT TO BE DEDUCTED FOR BATTERY AS WELL AS PRICING OF THIS PHONE. (DONT FORGET WE HAVE MICROMAX CANVAS HD3 AND KARBONN TITANIUM ETC PRICED BETTER FOR SIMILAR FEATURES. I FEEL AFTER THIS 15% CASH BACK &AMP; OWN NOW SCHEME ENDS, SAMSUNG MAY BRING DOWN THE PRICE OF THIS PHONE BY 15%).
      
      BUT CONSIDERING FLIPKART'S LOUSY SERVICE, I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT DOWN MY RATING TO 3.5/5. (4 STARS ARE ONLY FOR HANDSET).
      
      
      I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELP BUYERS TO DECIDE."
Galaxy Grand,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM RETAIL STORE..
      
      THE CONFIGURATIONS ARE FINE.. BUT PERFORMANCE IS LOW.
      
      RAM IS 1GB BUT ANDROID OS AND AUTOSTART APPS EATS UP THE ENTIRE RAM
      
      BATTERY IS THE MAIN ISSUE .. YOU HAVE TO CHARGE IT TWICE FOR CONTINOUS USE INCLUDING INTERNET, GAMING
      
      BESIDES CHARGING TAKES APPROX 2.5 HRS FOR COMPLETE CHARGE..
      
      
      SCREEN RESOLUTION IS NOT A PROBLEM. U CAN USE LAUNCHER IF YOU FEEL ICONS ARE STRETCHED..
      
      SUNLIGHT HAS A LITTLE IMPACT ON SCREEN.. BUT THATS NOT THE ISSUE.
      
      PERFECT PHONE FOR TRAVELERS.. DUAL SIM WITH DUAL STANDBY..
      
      I HAVE ROOTED THE PHONE.. FOR THE ISSUES DISCUSSED ABOVE(BATTERY AND RAM).."
Galaxy Grand,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 3RD MARCH AND SINCE THEN I DON'T REGRET MY DECISION OF GETTING THIS ANDROID PHONE FROM SAMSUNG. AS THE NAME SAYS.. THE PHONE IS INDEED 'GRAND'.  THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE AND I RESEARCHED A LOT BEFORE ZEROING ON THIS ONE. THE PHONES I COMPARED WITH THE GRAND WERE MICROMAX CANVAS HD A116, HTC ONE S, SONY XPERIA SL, HTC DESIRE X AND SAMSUNG GALAXY S2. WELL TO BE HONEST, THE CANVAS OFFERS ALMOST THE SAME OR SLIGHTLY BETTER FEATURES THAN THE GRAND BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A PREMIUM FEEL. ALSO I READ ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH THE AFTER SALES SERVICE OF MICROMAX AND SO DIDN'T BUY IT. THE ONE S IS A DECENT PHONE BUT THE LIMITED 16GB INTERNAL STORAGE (12GB - USABLE), THE S3 PROCESSOR AND A SLIGHTLY HIGHER COST (24000) DISAPPOINTED ME. EVEN THE DESIRE X DIDN'T IMPRESS ME MUCH. I WENT TO THE STORE FOR GETTING MYSELF THE SONY XPERIA SL. I LOVED THE FEATURES - 1.7GHZ PROCESSOR, 32GB INTERNAL STORAGE(26 GB - USABLE), 4.3 INCH SCREEN AND THE 12MP CAMERA. THE ONLY CONS WERE A BOXY DESIGN AND A MICRO-SIM (ADD NO DUAL SIM TO THAT). MORE ON SONY HAD NO IMMEDIATE PLANS FOR A JELLY BEAN UPGRADE. FINALLY IT WAS THE GRAND THAT HAD ALMOST ALL THE FEATURES IN IT. A 5 INCH SCREEN (187PPI - SO WHAT ? I NEVER FELT THE SCREEN WAS BAD), 8GB INTERNAL STORAGE (4GB USABLE - I WISH I HAD 16GB INTERNAL STORAGE), JELLYBEAN (IT IS BUTTER-SMOOTH) , 1GB RAM (SHOWS AROUND 800MB) DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, DUAL SIM (3G+2G), EXTERNAL EXPANDABLE MEMORY SLOT UPTO 64GB, 8 MP REAR AND 2MP FRONT LED FLASH CAMERA AND THE PREMIUM FEELING.
      
      CONS -
      
      1. YES THE BATTERY DRAINS OUT PRETTY FAST.
      
      2. CAMERA IS GREAT BUT NOT AWESOME.
      
      3. I WISH THE INTERNAL STORAGE WAS ATLEAST 16GB.
      
      4. NO GORILLA GLASS AND AMOLED SCREEN.
      
      5. DISPLAY PROBLEMS WITH GAMES LIKE SUBWAY SURFER.
      
      
      BUT THESE ARE NOT SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND I HOPE YOU WILL LOVE THIS PHONE."
Galaxy Grand,4,I GOT  ANEW PHONE FROM FLIPKART AND VIDEO FILES COPIED FROM INTERNAL MEMORY TO SD CARD ARE NOT THROWING AUDIO. IT COULD BE A BUG WITH SAMSUNG SOFTWARE. LET US KNOW IF IT A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL. OTHERWISE THIS PHONE IS WORTH BUYING FOR VARIOUS FEATURES.
Galaxy Grand,4,"I GOT THIS PHONE ON 25TH MARCH 2013. FLIPKART SERVICE WAS FINE AS USUAL?:)
      
      ABOUT THE PHONE:
      
      PROS:
      
      1.	DAMN BIG SCREEN, EVEN S3 OWNERS WILL ENVY?. :)
      
      2.	ANDROID JB IS AWESOME.
      
      3.	GOOD CAMERA
      
      CONS:
      
      1.	INTERNAL MEMORY IS ONLY 4GB NOT 8GB, SO OBVIOUSLY NOT SUITABLE FOR GAMERS AND GUYS WHO USE LOTTA APPS.
      
      2.	A BIT HEAVY AND BULKY"
Galaxy Grand,4,"I HAD USED THIS MOBILE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH NOW. THE MOBILE IS JUST FANTASTIC - TRUST ME, I HAD BOUGHT THIS MOBILE AFTER A LOT OF RESEARCH BY READING EXPERT REVIEWS.
      
      
      MOST OF THE USERS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MOBILE PHONE GETTING HANGED - IT'S JUST BECAUSE RAM IS ALMOST FULL (YES, MOST OF THE PRE INSTALLED APPS EAT UP A LOT OF RAM; GOOGLE AND SAMSUNG APPS FILL UP MOST OF THE RAM CAPACITY).
      
      BUT THERE IS A WAY TO KEEP IT UP AND RUNNING. NEED TO INSTALL ANY THIRD PARTY APP TO MANAGE THE STARTUP APPS AND ALSO NEED TO KILL UNWANTED APPS AS AND WHEN REQUIRED.
      
      
      BATTERY: BATTERY LASTS GOOD ENOUGH FOR 2 FULL DAYS FOR ME. USE WIFI CONNECTIVITY WHEREEVER POSSIBLE AND SWITCH OFF THE 'MOBILE DATA' OPTION, IF NOT REQUIRED. ALSO THERE ARE CERTAIN TWEAKS AVAILABLE TO ENSURE GOOD BATTERY BACKUP, BY TURNING OFF UNWANTED MOTION SETTINGS.
      
      
      DISPLAY: I HADN'T FOUND ANY ISSUE WITH THE 480 X 800 PIXEL RESOLUTION DISPLAY. EVERY TEXT IS READABLE OR EVERY VIDEO IS ENJOYABLE, EXCEPT FOR VERY VERY MINUTE PIXELATION EFFECTS THAT ARE  NOT ALWAYS NOTICEABLE.
      
      
      THE ONLY MAJOR ISSUE I FOUND IS THE DELAY IN OPENING THE CAMERA APP - YOU NEED TO WAIT FOR 4-5 SECS (OR EVEN HIGHER SOMETIMES) TO OPEN THE CAMERA APP AND START CLICKING PHOTOS..
      
      
      OVERALL IT'S A WORTHY MOBILE WITH THE DISCOUNTED PRICING AVAILABLE IN FLIPKART (I BOUGHT IT WITH 15% CASH BACK OFFER)."
Galaxy Grand,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT MICROMAX ACCIDENTALLY. ACTUALLY WAS TRYING TO BUY SUMSUNG WHICH HAD THE SAME CONFIGURATION WITH MICROMAX A73, BUT THE PRICE OF SUMSUNG WAS  HIGHER THAN THE MICOMAX. SO, THE SELLER TOLD ME TO SELECT THE MICROMAX A73 WITH THE SAME CONFIGURATION BUT MUCH CHEAPER PRICE, S AT THE END I BOUGHT MICROMAX A73.. IM TELLING YOU FRIENDS, THIS MICROMAX SMARTPHONE REALLY IS A CRAP...TOO SLOW, TO LAGGY, AND IT DIDN'T SUPPORT MANY GOOGLE APPS ETC. NOW, AFTER USING IT FOR 4 MONTHS I CAN'T PICK UP THE CALLS, CAUSE I CANT DRAG IT IN. THE KEY BOARD ALSO HAS PROBLEMS, S KEY, R KEY, ETC ETC ETC ETC ETC ETC ETC ETC....AND MORE ARE NOT WORKING.
      
      
      DO NOT COMPARE MICROMAX AND SUMSUNG FOR GOODNESS SAKE!"
Galaxy Grand,4,"I HAVE JUST PURCHASE IT FROM FLIPKART AND I MUST SAY THAT IT IS UP TO THE MARK ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT INVESTED BUT IF SOMEBODY IS WILLING TO BUY THIS IT SHOULD BE COMPARED WITH OTHER AVAILABLE MODELS.
      
      TALKING ABOUT THE PHONE BY USING IT IN A SHORT SPAN I FOUND THAT IT SHOULD HAVE THE SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY WHICH IS MUST FOR A GOOD SMART PHONE, HOWEVER IT IS STILL HAVING A GOOD WVGA RESOLUTION WHICH IS SATISFACTORY. OTHER FEATURES ARE GOOD LIKE CAMERA,PROCESSING SPEED ETC.
      
      
      LASTLY IT IS A GOOD DEAL ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT INVESTED &AMP; FEATURES PROVIDED.
      
      
      PRAMOD KUMAR"
Galaxy Grand,4,"I HAVENT BOUGHT THROUGH FLIPKART. I AM USING GRAND SINCE 5 WEEKS. I HAVEN'T CAME ACROSS ANY PROBLEMS YET.
      
      DON'T COMPARE THIS PHONE WITH MICROMAX CANVAS HD BECAUSE MICROMAX SUPPORT IS VERY LESS THAN SAMSUNG IN INDIA. GO FOR THIS PHONE IF U R GAMER. I AM PLAYING REAL FOOTBALL, CONTRACT KILLER(ALL VERSIONS) ETC. SUCH A HEAVY GAMES WITHOUT ANY LAG. TOUCH IS VERY SMOOTH AND YOU WILL BE AMAIZE WITH ITS MOTION FEATURES.
      
      THOUGH I DON'T LIKE THE PHOTO QUALITY AFTER ZOOMING. 4X DIGITAL ZOOM IS NOT THAT GOOD ENOUGH."
Galaxy Grand,4,"I ORDERED THE GALAXY GRAND METALLIC BLUE THROUGH FLIPKART. THIS WAS MY FIRST DEALING WITH THE FLIPKART TEAM. BEFORE PURCHASING I HAD DOUBTS REGARDING IT'S DELIVERY AS I WANTED IT DELIVERED AT A HOTEL ADDRESS, THE CUSTOMER CARE WAS VERY HELPFUL IN RESOLVING  MY QUERY AND GAVE ME CONFIRMATION OF DELIVERY AT HOTEL, BECAUSE OF WHICH I COULD BUY THIS PHONE UNDER THE 15% CASH BACK OFFER AND IT COSTED ME RS 17,765/- WHICH IS THE CHEAPEST DEAL. THE PHONE WAS DELIVERED WITHIN TWO DAYS IN AN EXCELLENT PACKING AND ABSOLUTELY SAFE MANNER. NOW GOING TO THE PHONE, IT IS AN EXCELLENT PHONE FROM THE SAMSUNG STABLE AND ALL MY DOUBTS OF BUYING EITHER THIS OR A116 HD ARE NOW CLEARED. THE PROCESSOR SPEED AND THE MEMORT(3.7 GB USER) TAKE IS WAY AHEAD OF CANVAS HD WHICH OFFERS A MERE HD DISPLAY. I BELIEVE A SMARTPHONE HAS TO BE SMART IN FEATURES AND PROCESSING AND NOT JUST A BETTER SCREEN WITH DUMB FEATURES. THE CUSTOMISATION OF ANDROID BY SAMSUNG IS UNBEATABLE. A HOST OF PREMIUM FEATURES LIKE THE MOTION, ONE HAND USAGE, CUSTOMISED KEYBOARD ALL MAKE THE PHONE A GRAND SMARTPHONE. I AM HAVING A FEW ISSUES WITH THE SOFTWARE AS OF NOW
      
      1. THE MESSAGE ICON SHOWS 1 EVEN IF I HAVE READ AND DELETED A MESSAGE.
      
      2. THE CAMREA SHORTCUT ON SWIPE LOCKSCREEN IS NOT WORKING WITH TAP AND FLIP MOTION.
      
      3. THE LIFT TO ANSWER FEATURE IS NOT WORKING.
      
      4. THE HORIZONTAL GYROSCOPE CALIBERATION IS NOT WORKING.
      
      I HOPE THESE PROBLEMS ARE RESOLVABLE BY TAKING IT TO SAMSUNG CENTRE WHILE THE PHONE IS UNDER WARRANTY AND THESE PROBLEMS ARE FROM SAMSUNG SIDE AND NOT FLIPKART SIDE WHO I BELIEVE WOULD NOT HAVE SHIPPED ME A DAMAGED PHONE."
Galaxy Grand,4,"I PURCHASE GRAND,
      
      I FOUND A PROBLEM IN GPS,
      
      SO I VISIT TO THE SERVIC CENTER AND TELL HIM FOR THE PROBLEM.
      
      SO EVERY ONE CHECK THIS PROBLEM AND GO FOR IT.
      
      I LIKE THIS MOBILE.
      
      CAMERA IS GOOG.
      
      LARGE DISPLAY.
      
      ALSO HAVE A FRONT CAMERA.
      
      INTERNAL STORAGE IS GOOD."
Galaxy Grand,4,"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE ON FLIPKART READING THE SPECIFICATIONS. WHILE THE PHONE IS A GOOD DUAL SIM OPTION AND SERVES MY PURPOSE. BUT AS THEY CLAIM THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS 8 GB, ITS ACTUALLY 4 GB. I DONT KNOW WHERE DID THE BALANCE 4 GB VANISH..."
Galaxy Grand,4,"I WANTED A DUAL SIM PHONE WITH A BIG DISPLAY AND WITH USEFULL FEATURES HENCE, I BOUGHT SAMSUNG GRAND IN MONTHS OF MARCH AND TILL TODAY I HAVE TRIED OUT ALL ITS FEATURES, PLAYED HARDCORE GAMES, WATCHED FULL LENGTH HD MOVIES BACK TO BACK TILL THE BATTERY COMPLETELY DRAINED OUT. I HAVE USED PHONE'S CAMERA A LOT AND I HAVE ALSO DONE FULL HD VIDEO RECORDING  AND  I MUST SAY THAT I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.
      
      BUT, THERE IS A NEVER A PRODUCT MADE WITHOUT ANY KIND OF FLAWS. :) HERE ARE THE FLAWS THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCE TILL NOW:
      
      THOUGH THE DISPLAY IS GREAT PRODUCING SATISFACTORY COLOURS AND CONTRAST, BUT THERE IS A SATURATION PROBLEM. I MEAN IF THERE IS AN IMAGE WITH RED COLOUR ON IT, THEN THE RED BECOME TOO  SATURATED.
      
      WHEN YOU ARE ON THE STREETS DURING DAYTIME, THEN IT BECOMES LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE THE DISPLAY UNLESS YOU INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS TO 70%. NOW, IF YOU KEEP THE DISPLAY BRIGHTNESS TO 70% ALL DAY LONG, THEN ITS GOING TO DRAIN PHONE'S BATTERY A LOT FASTER.
      
      I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH OTHER ANDROID PHONES, WHEN I CLICK ON THE GREEN LOG ICON ON THE HOMSCREEN, IT TAKES 2-3 SECONDS TO SHOW THE CONTENTS OF THE LOG. I APPROACHED THE SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE AND INQUIRED REGARDING THE SAME, HE SAYS THIS IS COMMON FLAW WITH THE SAMSUNG PHONES.
      
      WELL, SAMSUNG CLAIMS THAT PHONE HAS AN INBUILT MEMORY OF 8GB BUT WHEN YOU USE THE PHONE, YOU'LL BE SHOCKED TO SEE THAT IT OFFERS ONLY 4 GB OF USABLE MEMORY. SO, YOU ARE FORCED TO BUY AN EXTERNAL SD CARD IF YOU NEED TO STORE LOT OF SONGS AND MOVIES.
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY IS THE AREA WHERE SAMSUNG REALLY NEEDS TO IMPROVE A LOT. WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF USE, I STARTED TO SEE SCRATCHES ON THE BACK PANEL. WHEN YOU HOLD THE PHONE, IT FEELS FLIMSY. STILL, THE METALLIC PAINT ON THE BACK PANEL DOES LOOK UPMARKET.
      
      THE CAMERA OF PHONE IS GOOD BUT EVEN WITH THE ANTI-SHAKE FEATURE ACTIVATED, STILL PHOTOS DO COME SLIGHTLY SHAKY. LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY IS NOT ITS STRENGTH AT ALL. THE COLOUR RE-PRODUCTION IS GREAT AND EVEN THE HD VIDEO RECORDING IS GOOD.
      
      
      OVERALL, EVEN THOUGH WITH THE FLAWS, I FEEL RS. 19,000 PRICE TAG IS WORTH IT WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO MICROMAX CANVAS HD. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DUAL SIM PHONE AND IF YOU ARE READY TO COMPROMISE A LITTLE. THEN YOU WILL HAVE SMILE ON YOUR FACE. :)"
Galaxy Grand,4,"I WON'T TALK ABOUT ANY TECHNICAL SEPCS OF THE PHONE. ONLY THE IN HAND EXPERIENCE OF THE PHONE
      
      FIRST OF ALL GOT THE PHONE FOR 19800 IN BANGALORE.
      
      
      ALL THE  CONS THAT I COULD FIND ON THIS PHONE
      
      * RESOLUTION IS LESS YES, WVGA , IF YOU ARE A USER OF  PHONES LIKE XPERIA S,SL,SOLA, P. SAMSUNG S2,S3,IPHONE 4,4S  AND OTHERS U WILL IMMEDIATELY NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SCCREEN,THE ICONS,FONT,WIDGETS ETC. ARE BIGGER AND UGLY ELSE U WONT FIND A DIFFERENCE
      
      
      *YES THE PHONE HANGS (OR I MUST SAY FREEZES), IT FROZE THREE TIMES SO FAR,  MOSTLY WHEN U DO MULTI TASKING. WHEN IT FREEZES U DONT HAVE ANY OPTION BUT TO DETACH THE BATTERY AND RESTART (REMEMBR IT DIDNT LAG OR HANGED IN ANY CONDITION ,IT FROZE)
      
      
      * INTERNAL MEMORY IS A DISSAPOINTMENT , ONLY 4 GB OF AVAILABLE MEMORY. AND SINCE IT COMES WITH JELLY BEAN  YOU CANT REALLY TRANSFER UR APPS/GAMES TO SD CARD. SD CARD IS JUST FOR MOVIES,VIDS,MUSIC,PICS. (YES U CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY ROOTING IT)
      
      
      * CAMERA IS OHKAY, NOT THAT GREAT BUT ABOVE AVERAGE.
      
      
      *YOU ARE LEFT WITH  AROUND 680 MB OF RAM AFTER RESTARTING OF YOUR DEVICE
      
      
      * FEW SIMPLE GAMES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE LIKE LINE RUNNER 2, VECTOR ETC
      
      
      * NO NFC, MAKES IT AN OLD GRANDPA :(
      
      
      *DON'T BUY THE ELEGANT WHITE VARIETY OF THE PHONE, THE FLIP COVER LOOKS DIRTY IN ONE WEEK :( UNLESS LIKE GIRLS U KEEP IT IN A PURSE/ OR BAG
      
      
      *EAR PHONE QUALITY NOT THE BEST (IF U R A MUSIC LOVER, U'LL NOTICE IT INSTANTLY)
      
      
      NOW THE REASONS I LIKE THIS PHONE
      
      *IT GIVES A GRAND FEELING, MOST OF THE PEOPLE WILL MISTAKE IT WITH NOTE2, S3. TRUST ME IT FEELS GUD
      
      
      *THE PROCESSOR IS QUITE FAST, IT NEVER LAGS ,HANGS, (OTHER THAN FREEZING THRICE SO FAR), RAM IS SUFFICIENT TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC, SURF INTERNET AND AT THE SAME TIME DRAW SOMETHING IN SMEMO (USING MULTI WINDOW)
      
      
      *MULTI WINDOW, DIDNT REALLY USE IT SO FAR, OTHER THAN WHILE SHOWING OFF TO MY FRIENDS, BUT TELL ME HOW MANY PHONES IN THE MARKET HAS THIS FEATURE IN THEIR DEVICE.
      
      
      * CAMERA IS FAST. THE SHUTTER SPEED IS QUITE GOOD, NO LAG  . THE LED FLASH IS THE BEST IN THAT RANGE. THE VIDEO RECORDING IS ONE OF THE  BEST IN THE MARKET
      
      
      * THE UI OR THE TOUCHWIZ IS THE BEST PART OF THE DEVICE. YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH THE UI ASA U WILL HOLD THIS PHONE. EVERYTHING IS SO OPTIMIZED FOR ENHANCED USER EXPRIENCE. I M SURE THERE ARE LOT OF CHEAP PHONES WITH BETTER HARDWARE SPECS BUT SAMSUNG GRAND DEFEATS EVERYONE WITH ITS INTERFACE.
      
      
      * FEATURES TAKEN FROM NOTE2,S3 LIKE SMEMO, SVOICE, BUDDYSHARE, ETC ARE A GOOD INCLUSION
      
      
      *THE SCREEN DESPITE OF 187 PPI, LOOKS GREAT, THE COLORS WITH AMPLE SATURATION MAKES ITS SCREEN QUITE AWESOME.
      
      
      * LOVE WHAT THEY DID WITH THE MUSIC PLAYER, U NEVER HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ANY 3RD PARTY MUSIC PLAYER.
      
      
      SO , I CONSIDER GALAXY GRAND IS DECENT BUY, CONSIDERING YOUR NEEDS,
      
      IF YOU ARE NORMAL STUDENT OR FRESHER IN INDUSTRY AND CANT SPEND ABOVE 30 K TO GET THE PREMIUM SMART PHONES, AND IF YOU LISTEN TO THE MUSIC, PLAY ALL THE  POPULAR GAMES, CLICK AND INSTAGRAM/FB POST YOUR PICS, DO A LOT OF GOOGLING AND WIKIPEDIA, NEED MAP DIRECTION EVERY NOW AND THEN AND ARE INTO MESSAGING AND WHATSAPPING
      
      AND WANT TO CARRY A  PREMIUM LOOKING DEVICE WITH YOU, THAT GRABS ATTENTION EVERYTIME YOU CHECK YOUR PHONE
      
      THEN THIS IS THE PHONE FOR YOU .
      
      
      ALTERNATIVES : GHOSTLY MMX CANVAS HD(ALTHOUGH LESS INTERNAL MEMORY AND NO UI LIKE TOUCH WHIZ) , AND MAY BE XPERIA ION( WITH SERVER PRO WARRANTY)"
Galaxy Grand,4,"I?M USING THIS MOBILE FOR LAST 3 WEEKS AND I?M FEELING GREAT THAT I BOUGHT, REALLY WELL FOR THIS PRICE.
      
      SMALLER.
      
      
      AND PLEASE, FOR FUTURE COMMENTERS, PLEASE WRITE A REVIEW, ONLY IF YOU HAVE ACTUALLY USED THIS DEVICE. EVERYBODY KNOWS THE SPEC. YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT REDUNDANCY HERE.
      
      
      I LOVE MY GALAXY GRAND AND OF COURSE BEST MOBILE EVER FOR THIS PRICE
      
      
      BUT THE FLIPCART COURIER SERVICES ARE WORST IN NON-METROS CITY IT IS TAKEN 6 DAYS TO DELIVERED THEN ALSO NOT WITH OFFER (TRANSCEND MEMORY CARD MICROSD 16GB) FULLY DELIVERED AFTER 12 DAYS FROM ORDER DATE.
      
      LOOKS PRETTY MUCH LIKE NOTE II, MARGINALLY"
Galaxy Grand,4,"IF U HAVE TO PLAN A MIDDLE BUDGET SMARTPHONE THEN HERE IS THE BEST PHONE FOR YOU, DONT WORRY ABT THE DISPLAY WHICH IS COMPARED TO CANVAS HD, SAMSUNG GRAND DOESN'T DISAPPOINT WITH DISPLAY IT HAS DECENT DISPLAY AND BETTER BATTERY LIFE. GO FOR IT U WOULD EXPERIENCE SAMSUNG S3 OR NOTE WITH THIS GRAND."
Galaxy Grand,4,"IF YOU GO FOR 15% CASH BACK OFFER, ITS VERY WORTH BUYING. THE VIDEO RESOLUTION IS BIT LOWER COMPARED TO S3. BUT YOU WILL GET A WIDE AND BIG DISPLAY. JUST STARTED USING IT AND STARTED LOVING IT. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SMARTPHONE OF A MID RANGE WITH FRONT CAMERA AND DUAL SIM, THIS PHONE IS A PERFECT PICK."
Galaxy Grand,4,"IM USING THIS MOBILE FROM LAST ONE MONTH AND RESOLUTION OF THE SCREEN IS VERY GOOD COMPARED TO S ADVANCE(DESPITE SMALL SCREEN SIZE IE MORE PIXEL DENSITY). DONT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TECHNOLOGY SAMSUNG GUYS USED TO COVER THE LESS PPI. AND I HAVEN'T FACED ANY LAGS WITH THIS MOBILE SO FAR. HAVE SEEN MANY OF THE REVIEWERS ARE SAYING THAT THE RESOLUTION IS A DRAWBACK FOR THIS MOBILE. YOU CANNOT IDENTIFY PIXELS TOO. BUT I DONT COMPARE THE RESOLUTION  WITH THAT OF HIGH END DEVICES LIKE S3.
      
      ANY HOW THANKS FLIPKART FOR PROMPT DELIVERY..AND  THANKS SAMSUNG............"
Galaxy Grand,4,"ITS A NICE DEVICE.....GOT A METALLIC BLUE ONE.....LOOKS MARVELOUS....GOOD SPECS.....CAM IS 8 MP BUT THE IMAGE OUTPUT DOES NOT LET YOU FEEL THE SAME ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SHOOT THE PICS AT NIGHT WITH FLASH....DESPITE OF HAVING SUCH GREAT SPECS FOR A PHONE OF THIS PRICE RANGE, GAME LIKE SUBWAY SURFERS IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS DEVICE FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE....YOU CAN GET THAT FROM THIRD PARTY OF COURSE BUT THEN YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET AN UPDATE FOR THE SAME....NO FLASH PLAYER. THE DISPLAY IS PRETTY GOOD....DO NOT GO BY THE REVIEWS MENTIONING THAT THE DISPLAY IS WEAK OR SOMETHING....OVERALL A GOOD PACKAGE APART FROM THE ABOVE MENTIONED ISSUES."
Galaxy Grand,4,ITS BEEN A WEEK M USIN DIS FONE... AND MUST SAY IT ROCKS... EVRY ONE IS SAYIN ABT D SCREEN RESOLUTION.. EVN I ACCEPT BT ITS NOT DAT BAD.. HD MOVIES R AMAZIN TO WATCH ON DIS BIG SREEN.. BAD THING ABT IT IS D BATTERY LIFE.. BT ITS AN ISSUE ON ALL D ANDROID PHONES.. WID HEAVY USAGE IT LASTS FOR 12 TO 14 HRS.. AND V CAN PLAY SUBWAY SURFERS.. PLAY STORE WILL SHOW U NOT AVAILABE ON DIS DEVICE.. BT U CAN SHARE IT THRU APP SHARER FRM A FRND AS I DID.. WORKS CHARM... GO FOR IT.. DONT HESITATE.. :D
Galaxy Grand,4,"LOTS OF PEOPLE ASKED ME WHY I BOUGHT THE GRAND AND NOT THE S3. I DON'T OWN AN S3, BUT I DON'T THINK THE GRAND IS ANY LOWER. VERY GOOD FEATURES, LOVE THE BIG SCREEN, MOST OF THE APPS COME ON IT AND VERY EASY TO DOWNLOAD ALL THE FREE APPS. FREEZES ON SOME OF THE GAMES, LIKE ATLANTIC PEARL"
Galaxy Grand,4,"MY 1ST BUY FROM FLIPKART. BOOK MY GRAND ON 25 JUNE 13 NIGHT FOR RS. 16,626 DELIVERED ON 28 JUNE 13. ALL I CAN SAY THAT THIS ONE OF THE BEST MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN GET WITHIN THIS PRICE RANGE. MMX PHONES ARE ALSO GOOD AS LONG AS IT WORKING."
Galaxy Grand,4,"OK,FOR THOSE MICROMAX CANVAS LOVERS OUT THERE, I HAD A CHINA HANDSET WITH SIMILAR SPECS AS STATED ABOVE,LIKE SCREEN,DUAL CORE PROCESSOR ND 1GB RAM(2500MAH) WITH ICS,WORTH JUST 8 GRAND, I USED IT  FOR LIKE 4 MONTHS NW, ND LEMME TELL U THE PHONE USED TO LAG ALOT NOT IN GAMES,BUT IN EMERGENCIES,LIKE I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY SEND A PPT TO SOMEONE ND THE BLUETOOTH WAS NOT EVEN TURNING ON FOR LIKE 30MINUTES, ND THE DIALER TOOK LONG TIME TO OPEN,SO IM SURE U WUD HAV FACED SUCH CONSEQUENCES.
      
      
      NOW COMING TO GRAND
      
      ITS AN AMAZING PHONE,ITS BEEN 3 DAYS NW,NICE FLIPKART DELIVERY BT TOOK 4 DAYS,THE PHONE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS NOT THAT BAD,I MEAN U WONT SEE ANY PIXEL PROBLEMS AT ALL,0 LAG IN ALL GAMES,MULTITASKING IS BUTTER SMOOTH (U R PLAYING A GAME ND WANNA GO TO FACEBOOK, U R JUST A BUTTON AWAY ND WITH THE SCREEN U LEFT IT PREVIOUSLY) ND OBOVSLY JELLY BEAN IS AMAZING,IITS LIKE A BREAKTHROUGH OF ICS WITH THE S VOICE ND ALL.ND GUYS BUY THE METALLIC BLUE DONT GO FOR WHITE,CZ WITH BLUE PHONE U GET A BLUE COVER, WHICH JUST MATCHES ITS STYLE.
      
      ND BATTERY LIFE IS PRETTY NICE,ND CHARGING TIME NEEDED IS JUST 1 ND HALF HOUR(IN THE EARLIER CHINA PHONE I HAD TO CHARGE WHOLE NIGHT FOR 100% BATTERY) AND I GOT AROUND 10 HRS BATTERY LIFE(BELIEVE IT R NOT!) THATS AMAZING CZ I HAD BEEN USING GAMES ND FACEBOOOK ND  FR A PHONE AS BIG AS THIS,THE PHONE IS REMARKABLE,
      
      
      NOW COMING TO THE DOWNSIDE OF THIS PHONE,THE FRONT CAMERA DOES PROVIDE 2MP RESOLUTION,  IT,BUT THE REAR CAMERA GIVES WAYY LESS RESOLUTION THAN  8MP,U MIGHT SAY IT IS 5MP.AND REGARDING THE FLASH,THE FLASH IS REALLY BRIGHT,SOO BRING U CUD USE IT AS A FLASHLIGHT(LITERALLY) BUT WHEN U USE FLASH THE PHOTOS DONT GET AS BRIGHT AS EXPECTED.THE PHONE IS PRETTY SMOOTH IN PERFORMANCE,BUT THERE WAS 2 FREEZES TILL NW, ND I HAD TO TAKE OFF THE BATTERY(ITS NOT OFTEN BUT EXTREMELY RARE).
      
      
      THE CAMERA WAS PRETTY DISSAPOINTING AS I HAD EXPECTED AN AMAZING 8MP QUALITY IT MAYBE BE DUE TO THE LOW SCREEN RESOLUTION, OTHER PHONE IS PRETTY SWEET"
Galaxy Grand,4,"ON THE WHOLE, SAMSUNG IS CAPTURING THE MARKET JUST A COMMERCIAL FLICK. BUT IS IT WORTH THE MONEY?
      
      WHAT ARE WE PAYING FOR?
      
      THE BRAND, SAMSUNG, LET'S ACCEPT WHICH ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO SAY I HAVE THIS BRAND.
      
      SAMSUNG IS A TESTED AND TRIED COMPANY AND ANY DAY I WOULD VOUCH FOR THE MODEL THAN TO TRY OTHER LESSER BRAND AND WEEP FOR THE WHOLE MONEY I SPENT.
      
      
      DOES IT PERFORM WELL?
      
      
      LETS NOT GET INTO THE DETAILS OF WHETHER THE PROCESSOR IS GOOD, RAM IS OPTIMUM,WHETHER THE DISPLAY RESOLUTION IS JUSTIFIABLE OR NOT. STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BOX YOU HAVE A 5"" DISPLAY AND YOU SWITCH IT ON, THE FIRST THING YOU SAY WOW AND YES FOR THE PRICE TOO. RUN THROUGH THE GRAND, OPEN AS MUCH APPS AS YOU WANTS, YOU STILL HAVE 180 SORTS OF RAM FREE, WHICH I WOULD SAY IS AWESOME. BUT YES IT HAS ITS OWN GLITCHES, BLAME IT ON THE OS I WOULD SAY, RATHER THAN GOING ON ABOUT BLAMING THE SPECS. EVERY ANDROID DEVICE I HAVE USED HAS ENCOUNTERED SOME OR THE OTHER GLITCHES BUT THIS BY FAR HAS BEEN THE MOST STABLE DEVICE. BATTERY LIFE IS PRETTY DECENT TOO.
      
      
      WHO SHOULD BUY IT?
      
      
      I WOULD SUGGEST THIS MODEL FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR AN ANDROID DEVICE, NOT BOTHERED ABOUT SPECS, RATHER FOCUSSED ON A DEVICE WHICH CAN DELIVER THE GOODS AT ITS BEST,THE DISPLAY, THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING A 5"", THE MULTIMEDIA SUPPORT AND SAMSUNG. GO FOR IT !!!"
Galaxy Grand,4,"ORDERED THIS PHONE ON 18TH JUNE EVENING. RECEIVED IT ON 21ST JUNE AFTERNOON.

      ALL FEATURES &AMP; FUNCTIONALITIES ARE GOOD EXCEPT FEW CONS. CAMERA IS NOT GOOD UNDER LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS. VOLUME IS A BIT ON LOWER SIDE. BATTERY IS NOT OF MUCH USE. EVEN UNDER MODERATE USE, YOU WILL NEED TO CHARGE IT ATLEAST TWICE A DAY.
      
      
      HOWEVER, LIMITATIONS APART, OVERALL IT'S A GOOD PHONE. BETTER TO CONTRIBUTE 4K MORE INSTEAD OF MICROMAX CONVAS HD. ATLEAST YOU NEED NOT HIDE THE MANUFACTURER."
Galaxy Grand,4,"SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND DUOS IS THE BEST MOBILE PHONE AVAILABLE IN 20K RANGE. GO FOR IT...
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FROM LAST 1 MONTH.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      LOOKS AMAZING
      
      TOUCHSCREEN RESPONDS PERFECTLY
      
      8 MP PRIMARY CAMERA, 2 MP SECONDARY CAMERA
      
      5 INCH SCREEN, QUALITY DISPLAY
      
      FULL HD RECORDING
      
      HIGH RESOLUTION VIDEOS PLAY SMOOTHLY
      
      BEST DUAL SIM PHONE
      
      MULTI-WINDOW OPERATION IS FUN
      
      FLIP COVER (IN THE BOX)
      
      1.2 GHZ DUAL CORE + 1 GB FOR ANY APPLICATION
      
      ANDROID V4.1 (JELLY BEAN) IS FAST
      
      
      CONS:
      
      BATTERY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
      
      SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY INSTEAD OF WVGA
      
      
      FLIPKART DELIVERED WITHIN 2 BUSINESS DAYS WITH USUAL GREAT PACKAGING. GREAT SERVICE"
Galaxy Grand,4,"SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND DUOS ROCKS..IT IS AN AWESOME PHONE AND HAS A 5 INCH SCREEN WHICH MAKES IT MORE HANDSOME..HAD SUPERB EXPERIENCE WHILE USING IT ..AND ABOVE ALL THE FLIP KART DELIVERY WAS GREAT.
      
      I WOULD RATE THE PHONE 4 OUT OF 5 BECAUSE OF THE REASON THAT THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS 4 GB ONLY YET IT IS EXPENDABLE TO 64 GB. BUT IT SHOULD HAVE AN INTERNAL MEMORY OF AT LEAST 8 GB.
      
      REST, ITS A GR 8 BUY..GO FOR IT WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.

      PRICE 19K
      
      DATE OF PURCHASE : 24/05/2013
      
      
      PREVIOUS PHONE : LG OPTIMUS 4X HD
      
      
      PROS
      
      1) WELL I LIKED MANY UI TWEAKS ND APPS SUCH AS ASSISTIVE LIGHT,SWIPE TO CALL ND NUMEROUS OTHERS. THERE ARE IN FACT MANY INBUILT APPS WHICH ELIMINATE THE TOTAL NEED FOR THIRD PARTY ONES.
      
      SAMSUNG IN MY OPINION HAS THE COOLEST UI SO FAR IN ANDROID PHONES.
      
      2) BIG SCREEN. YEAH SINCE I'M A BIG MAN AND HAVE BIG HANDS AND FINGERS, I FELT VERY COMFORTABLE USING THIS PHONE.ESPECIALLY TYPING. MAY NOT APPEAL TO MANY BUT A BIG THING FOR ME.
      
      3) GLONASS. SINCE I LIKE AND LOVE TO TRAVEL AND ALSO I USE GPS SERVICE EXTENSIVELY I WANTED BETTER ACCURACY FOR MY TRACKS. MY LG WAS NOT HAVING GLONASS AND NOW USING BOTH I FEEL BETTER WITH  THIS GLONASS COUPLED PHONE.
      
      4) I HATE TO ADMIT : LOOKS
      
      NEVER IN MY PAST I HAVE CONSIDERED LOOKS AS A CRITERIA FOR PHONE SELECTION. BUT THE LG PHONE WHICH I BOUGHT HAD  MEDIOCRE LOOKS AND PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT I PAID 28K FOR THAT.
      
      5) DUAL SIM IS PRETTY GOOD AND WE CAN GET CALLS IN BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. IT ALSO LETS US TO PUT DIFFERRENT WALL PAPERS FOR DIFFERENT SIMS.
      
      
      CONS
      
      1) RESOLUTION
      
      SINCE IT HAS A LOW RESOLUTION THE ICONS AND TEXTS LOOK BIGGER AND LESS CRISPY. THIS IS A LET DOWN WHEN WE ARE READING TEXT IN WEBSITES OR READING E BOOKS.
      
      
      I HAVNT WRITTEN ABOUT THE PROCESSING POWER AND RAM SINCE I HAVENT INSTALLED LOADS OF APPS AND GAMES IN THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS EXPERIANCE. I INSTALLED ABOUT 150 APPS IN MY LG OPTIMUS 4X, AND IT HANGED VERY OFTEN AND WHAT I NOTED WAS, EXCEPT FOR A HANDFUL FEW APPS, I DIDNT USE MUCH. SO HERE IN DUOS I HAVE INSTALLED ONLY ABOUT 10 MOST USED APPS AND IT IS RUNNING FINE WITHOUT HANGING"
Galaxy Grand,4,"SAMSUNG GRAND GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY , EXCELLENT DISPLAY,CAMERA IS SUPERB. PLUS BATTERY BACK IS ALSO VERY GOOD. IN 20K ITS BEST PHONE IN THE MARKET. I DID RESEARCH ON VARIOUS PHONES MICROMAX HD,A110 ARE ALSO GOOD BUT THEY ARE OUT OF STOCK ON MOST OF THE SITES AND STORES.
      
      AND MOREOVER IF WE COMPARE SAMSUNG AND MICROMAX AND THEN DEFINATELY SAMSUNG PRODUCTS ARE FAR FAR BETTER. I WOULD SAY ITS MUST BUY PHONE."
Galaxy Grand,4,"SAMSUNG GRAND
      
      I ENQUIRD ABOUT ALL THE MOBILES WCH ARE AROUND 20K N FINALLY TUK GRAND
      
      
      I HEARD COMPLAINTS ABT THT ,,, IT OFTEN HANGS

      THS PHONE IS GUD IF U KNW ABT APPPS N HW 2 USE IT
      
      TAK IT N ENJY IT..........."
Galaxy Grand,4,"SAMSUNG HAS PUT IN LOT OF VALUE ON THIS PRODUCT. WORKS WELL BUT AS USUAL, BATTERY STANDS FOR JUST ONE DAY. I FIND 2G SPEEDS ABYSMALLY  SLOW IN GRAND WHILE 3G SIM WORKS NEATLY.  AS USUAL FLIPKART SERVICE WAS SMOOTH AND DELIVERY SPOT-ON"
Galaxy Grand,4,"THE DEVICE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ANDROID HANGS UP BUT WELL THE PROCESSOR IS SUPER FAST WHICH ENABLES ME TO PLAY HIGH GRAPHICS GAME.THE BEST PART THE BATTERY,MICROMAX CANVAS CAN'T LAST FOR PROPER 3 HOURS BUT WITH WIFI &AMP; 3G ON THIS SEXY PIECE GOES ON &AMP; ON.GOOD CAMERA,FAST,CHEAP...FELLAS JUST BUY IT!!!!"
Galaxy Grand,4,"THE PHONE IS AMAZING WITH 8MP CAMERA AND MULTI-WINDOW OPTION. PEOPLE SAY THAT THE RESOLUTION IS NOT GOOD, TRUST ME YOU WILL NOT MAKE OUT THE DIFFERENCE. USING A 5 INCH PHONE IS ALSO GREAT WITH 4 GB SPACE TO STORE YOUR APPS. I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND. I WIULD GIVE 5 STARS, BUT I WONDER WHY WHATSAPP IS NOT WORKING ON 2G ON THIS PHONE WHEN I CAN BROWSE AND CHECK MY MAILS IN GOOD SPEED."
Galaxy Grand,4,"THESE FEATURES ARE GOOD :
      
      1. SUPPORTING ALL GAMES
      
      2. 1280 * 720 MKV VIDEOS
      
      3. YOU CAN PLAY CONTINUOUS GAMES IT WONT HEAT UP.
      
      4. SCREEN BRIGHTNESS
      
      5. TOUCH SCREEN
      
      6. SOFTWARE IS ALWAYS UP TO DATE.
      
      
      ITS BETTER MOBILE IN THE RANGE OF 15000 TO 25000"
Galaxy Grand,4,"THIS IS A BRILLIANT PHONE WITH BRILLIANT FEATURES AND BETTER THAN MICROMAX CANVAS IN TERMS OF EITHER IT IS CAMERA,FUNCTIONING,TOUCH AND ALL OTHER THINGS..
      
      SO GO FOR IT AND BUY THIS SUPERB MOBILE.........."
Galaxy Grand,4,"THIS IS A NICE PHONE
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE RECENTLY AND AM HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAMERA QUALITY, PHONE SPEED, TOUCH SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS AND BATTERY LIFE.
      
      
      OVERALL PERFORMANCE IS GOOD AND ANDROID HAS GOOD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS AS WELL."
Galaxy Grand,4,"TO BE FAIR ENOUGH REGARDING THE PHONE SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND IS A GOOD MID RANGE PHONE AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. THE DELIVERY OF FLIPKART IS VERY NICE AND NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT.
      
      BUT EMI OFFER OF STANDARD CHARTERED BANK DID NOT WORK IN MY CASE . THE TRANSACTION TOOK PLACE ON 30/4/13 BUT STILL NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR.IT IS A TRAP BY STANDARD CHARTERED TO MAKE BIG BUDGET PURCHASE AND THEN LET YOU MAKE PAY THE ENTIRE AMOUNT AT ONE GO.IN FACT SEVERAL COMPLAINTS TO THE BANK AND EMAIL WERE IN VAIN AND I HAVE BEEN ADDED LATE CHARGES AND FINE FOR THAT  EVEN AFTER ASSURANCES BOTH FROM BANK AND FLIPKART.
      
      INFACT FLIPKART SAYS EMI SUCCESSFULLY PROCESSED AND BANK SAYS THERE IS NO SUCH INTIMATION.
      
      SO BEFORE CHOOSING EMI OPTION WITH STANDARD CHARTERED THINK AGAIN?"
Galaxy Grand,4,"VERY GOOD FONE WITH A REASONABLE PRICE.
      
      VERY MUCH EXCITED ABOUT THE FEATURES LIKE THE OS UI.
      
      YES EVERY ONE WHO WANTS TO GET SOME FEATURES LIKE A GOOD SMART FONE LIKE S3 AND S2 WITH SUCH A BIG SCREEN SHOULD GO FOR THIS FONE.
      
      I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM STILL NOW BUT HOPE THAT IT WILL END A VERY GOOD CHOICE.
      
      BUT I AM VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED BY THE FLIPKART DELIVERY AS THE DELIVERY DATE SHIFTED 3 TIMES."
Galaxy Grand,4,"WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS OF USAGE AND EXPERIMENTING WITH THIS PHONE. AS OF WITH THE  LOOKS WITHOUT FLIP COVER IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR ARE USING AN S3 IN YOUR HAND. DEFINITELY WILL MAKE YOUR SHOULDERS WIDER, BUT COMING TO ITS REALITY AT SOMETIMES YOU REPENT FOR BUYING THIS. AM NOT GONA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE SPECIFICATIONS AS ALL KNOW ABOUT IT. I'LL JUST REVIEW IT.
      
      
      GOING WITH PRO SIDE:
      
      
      -THE LOOK AND FEEL IS AWESOME.
      
      -THE BUILD QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD BIT PLASTICKY BUT OK.
      
      -EARPHONE EFFECTS (BASS) IS SUPERB.
      
      -NO PIXELATION  EVEN THOUGH HAVING WVGA DISPLAY.
      
      -CAMERA IS GOOD INFACT PRETTY GOOD.
      
      -TOUCH INTERFACE IS SMOOTH ENOUGH
      
      -WELL SPACED KEYBOARD
      
      
      GOING WITH CON SIDE:
      
      
      -THIS PART IS MORE INTERESTING AS COMPARED WITH PRO SIDE. DON'T KNOW FROM WHERE TO BEGIN WITH.MOVING ON THE PHONE ITSELF IS QUITE HEAVY WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER HIGHEND PHONES OF SAMSUNG + THE FLIP COVER ADDS EVEN MORE WEIGHT.
      
      -FLIP COVER BEING WHITE IT TENDS TO GET DIRTY VERY QUICKLY( IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU AREN'T CONCERNED ABOUT IT REMAINING WHITE)
      
      -THE BATTERY ISN'T GOOD. AT THE MAX IT WOULD LAST UP FOR 4-5HRS IF YOU ARE AN HEAVY USER ELSE YOU CAN MANAGE IT FOR THE ENTIRE DAY.
      
      -THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS SAID AS 8GB BUT OUT OF WHICH ONLY 3.96 GB IS AVAILABLE, REMAINING IS DEDICATED FOR ANDROID AND SAMSUNG PREINSTALLED SOFTWARES.  ITS OK IF YOU ARE GETTING FULL 3.96 GB FOR USAGE BUT THE CELL STARTS SHOWING WARNING WHEN THE MEMORY IS BELOW 300MB AND DOESN'T ALLOW INSTALLATION OF EVEN THE 2MB APPLICATION WHEN THE MEMORY IS BELOW 250MB. THIS IS PHATHETIC!!!!!
      
      - MOVING OF APPLICATION TO THE MEMORY CARD ISN'T AVAILABLE EVEN AFTER INSTALLING THIRD PARTY SOFTWARES.
      
      - BASIC GAMES LIKE SUBWAY SURFER SYDNEY AND MANY MORE AREN'T SUPPORTED BY THIS CELL WHERE IN TOP GAMES LIKE REAL RACING 3 ETC WORK BEAUTIFULLY IN XOLO Q800 AND CANVAS HD.
      
      -THOUGH 1.2GHZ IT DO HANGS FREQUENTLY THUS FORCING U TO RESTART!!!
      
      
      BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY AT ONE POINT YOU ARE DIGNIFIED WHEN YOU ARE AMONG THE GROUP OF PEOPLE AS THE BRAND MATTERS, ON  OTHER POINT FOR A GAMER LIKE ME EVEN THE FEATURES &AMP; RELIABILITY MATTERS.
      
      IF YOU ARE NOT AN HEAVY GAMER THEN THIS PHONES IS DEFINITELY THE BEST..ELSE THINK TWICE IF YOU ARE A GAMER
      
      
      CONSIDERING THE POINT OF BATTERY AND INTERNAL MEMORY AM GIVING 3.5(4) STARS."
Galaxy Grand,4,"YA.. I WAS USER OF SAMSUANG AND HTC IN PAST.. UNFORTUNATE I HAVE TO BUY DUAL SIM PHONE AND AS USUAL I ALSO THINK THAT MICROMAX PROVIDE SO MANY THING IS VERY LOW PRICE COMPARE TO HTC AND SAMSUNG.. EVEN THAT TIME DUAL SIM PHONE WAS COSTLY IN HTC.
      
      
      THATS WHY I SWITCH OVER TO MMX. AND PURCHASED A90S
      
      AND SUFFERING START FROM PURCHASE DATE
      
      COUNT MY SUFFERING
      
      1. MORE HEATED WHEN CHARGING
      
      2. SOMETIME AUTOMATICALLY START FUNCTIONING WITHOUT TOUCH THE PHONE..EG OPEN MENU.. CAMERA.. SHUTDOWN ETC
      
      3. HANG THRICE A DAY INFORM TO MMX SERVICE CENTRE WORST REPLY FORM THERE EVEN NO REPLY FROM MAIL SERVICE.
      
      4. VIDEO RECORDING ONLY IN .3GP MODE
      
      5. SAYS SUPER ALMOND SCREEN BUT NOT FEEL LIKE THAT
      
      6. BATTERY NEED TO CHARD TWICE A DAY
      
      7. EVEN I NEED TO MAKE CALL, HAVE TO WAIT ATLEAST 2 MINUTE TO OPEN CONTACT OR DIAL MENY.. EXTREMLY SLOW
      
      6. AND LAST 4 MONTH NEED TO FACTORY SETTING 3 TIMES
      
      AND SO MANY....
      
      MMX PHONE OLNY : KAJAG KE SHER HAI.

      BIG 0 STAR FOR MMX ( NOT OPTION AVAILABLE TO RATE 0 STAR SO I GIVE 1 STAR FOR MMX ONLY NOT GRAND) I M NOT USING GRAND AT THIS MOMENT BUT PAST EXPERIENCE ABOUT SAMSUNG I WILL GIVE 4 STAR TO GRAND"
Galaxy Grand,3,"1.DATA CONNECTION GETS LOST AUTOMATICALLY FOR FEW MINUTES AFTER EVERY FEW MINUTES.
      
      2.PHONE GETS SWITCHED OFF AUTOMATICALLY AT LEAST ONCE A DAY.
      
      
      EXCEPT THESE TWO ISSUES PHONE IS GREAT BUT THESE TWO ISSUES ARE MAJOR ISSUES AND HAVE ALSO FOUND ON VARIOUS FORUMS, PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT SAME BUT THIS ISSUE IS NOT WITH ALL THE HANDSETS BUT THERE ARE A FEW.SO YOU NEED TO HAVE A GOOD LUCK FOR GETTING A PROBLEM FREE GRAND. ITS LIKE BUYING A CHINESE PHONE WHICH MIGHT WORK FOR YEARS OR IT MAY SHOW UP THE PROBLEMS ON THE FIRST DAY ITSELF."
Galaxy Grand,3,"ACCOLADES FOR FLIPKART - TIMELY SHIPMENT, GOOD PACKAGING AND SMOOTH DELIVERY OF THESE ITEMS.
      
      
      STRAIGHT FACTS -
      
      
      POSITIVISM:
      
      
      1.DISPLAY, EVEN THOUGH NOT AMOLED OR IPS, IS REASONABLY DECENT- THAT'S WHERE CUSTOMERS COMPROMISE WHICH I FEEL IS FAIRLY JUSTIFIED.
      
      
      2.SNAPPY WITH LITTLE OR NO LAG ON A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR - GOOD ENOUGH FOR MULTI-PROCESSING AND TASKING.
      
      
      3.HANDLES 1080P VIDEOS SMOOTHLY WITHOUT THE NEED OF HARDWARE ACCELERATION - THE UNIT COMES WITH A BROADCOM GPU, DOING A HIGH FRAME RATE.
      
      
      4. HAS THE HARDWARE TO SUPPORT GLONASS ALONG WITH A-GPS, HELPS TO PIN POINT LOCATIONS EFFICIENTLY AND ACCURATELY.
      
      
      NEGATIVISM:
      
      
      1. BATTERY COULD HAVE BEEN BIGGER, DRAINS OUT QUICKLY, EVEN AFTER OPTIMIZING BATTERY PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      2. PRIMARY CAMERA 8MP - PICTURE QUALITY NOT THAT GREAT (OBJECTS AND NOT SUBJECTS AT TIMES ARE OUT OF FOCUS), 2MP SECONDARY CAMERA (FRONT) NOT CAPABLE OF HD RECORDING (NOT EVEN AT 720P).
      
      
      3.AT THIS PRICE, THE PHONE COULD HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH A MICRO/MINI HDMI PORT.
      
      
      4. 8GB INTERNAL MEMORY - DON'T GET ELUDED - OUT OF THE TOTAL DEVICE STORAGE, 4GB IS UTILIZED BY ANDROID OS, USERS'  HAVE ONLY 4GB (LESS THAN 3.84GB IN PRINCIPLE) BUT THEN AGAIN YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION OF EXPANDING IT UPTO 64GB.
      
      
      AS PART OF THE COMBO OFFER - THE TRANSCEND 16GB MICRO SDHC CARD HAS A POOR WRITE SPEED, THEREFORE, COPYING FILES TO THE STORAGE MEMORY FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE OVER THE DATA CABLE PROVIDED IS GROSSLY SLOW.SLIGHT PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT COULD BE SEEN IF THE CARD IS USED IN THE CARD READER SLOT OF A LAPTOP OR DESKTOP.
      
      
      ON A WHOLE - GOOD PHONE WHEN PRICE TO PERFORMANCE RATIO IS CONSIDERED.
      
      
      'BUILD QUALITY'  OF THE PHONE MIGHT BE GOOD..WHY I AM SAYING THIS AS I HAVE NOT USED ANY OTHER NEW GENERATION SMARTPHONES, BUT OVERALL QUALITY WOULD HAVE TO COUNT THE AFTER SALES SUPPORT THAT A COMPANY ASSURES A BUYER  EVEN AFTER END OF WARRANTY PERIOD..KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED ON THE SERVICE...AS I HAD A BITTER PAST EXPERIENCE WITH ONE OF THE SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRES IN KOLKATA."
Galaxy Grand,3,"ALL NEW INDIAN BRANDS ARE DOING PRETTY WELL AND IM HAPPY.BE INDIAN BUY INDIAN.
      
      WHY PAY 10 TO 15K EXTRA FOR THE SAME SPECS ? JUST COZ ITS SAMSUNG HTC OR APPLE ?
      
      START THINKING GUYS.ITS NOT LIKE SAMSUNG GIVES YOU LIFETIME WARRANTY.AND SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTERS ARE FULL OF DEFECTED PIECES.AND AFTER 1 YEAR SAMSUNG PHONES START GIVING YOU PROBLEMS.ITS RESTARTS ON ITS OWN, DNT CATCH SIGNALS ETC ETC.EXPERIENCED IT ALL.
      
      IN SHART WHAT IM SAYING IS INDIAN BRANDS R NOT CHEAP.QUALITY IS NOT CHEAP.GET THAT OUT OF YOUR HEAD.
      
      GRAND DUOS IS GOOD PHONE BUT DUAL PROCESSOR WHEREAS MICROMAX HD HAS QUAD.AND YES ITS 7K CHEAPER.BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD FOR BOTH.MAYBE MICROMAX BETTER.GRAPHICS R OFCOURSE BETTER IN MICROMAX HD.SAMSUNG PHONES ALSO HEAT UP WHILE PLAYING HD GAMES."
Galaxy Grand,3,"AS THE TITLE SAYS , ITS A GOOD PHONE .
      
      GALAXY GRAND DUOS HAS NO PROBLEM WITH LOW PIXELS , STILL THE THE PICTURE QUALITY ISNT THAT BAD .
      
      ALMOST ALL GAMES ARE WORKING FINE BUT THERE ARE ISSUES LIKE IN MOST WANTED , IF YOU PAUSE THE GAME AND/OR PRESS HOME BUTTON SOMETIMES IT MAY JUST HANG AND YOU WUD HAVE NO WAY TO RESTART TOO SOMETIMES SO  REMOVING BATTERY IS ONLY SOLUTION.
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PHABLET .
      
      
      WANTED TO GIVE 4 STAR BUT DUE TO SOME ISSUES I AM GIVING 3 STARS AND DO NOTE THAT GALAXY GRAND IS A GUD PRODUCT"

Galaxy Grand,3,"FIRST OF ALL.. A VERY BIG THANKS TO FLIPKART.
      
      I PURCHASED THIS PHONE 35 DAYS AGO..
      
      AFTER USING 4-5 DAYS FOUND MY PHONE HANG REPEATEDLY,TOUCHSCREEN WAS NOT RESPONDING WELL AND PHONE WAS VERY SLOW...
      
      ***FLIPKART ARRANGED A REPLACEMENT***
      
      PHONE WAS GOING WELL FOR 15 DAYS BUT WITH ONLY WHATSAPP,FACEBOOK,TEMPLE RUN OZ AND SKYPE.
      
      AFTER THAT MY BROTHER INSTALLED SOME APPLICATIONS FROM GOOGLE PLAY
      
      N MY GRAND IS NOT THAT GRAND NOW...
      
      VERY SLOW....
      
      EVEN OPENING THE DIALER PAD AFTER WAITING A LONG TIME.
      
      FLIPKART AGAIN GIVING ME A REPLACEMENT.
      
      BUT I THINK THERE IS THE GRAND'S PROBLEM NOT OF SOME PERTICULAR HANDSETS..
      
      IF MICROMAX HAD A GOOD AFTERSALES SERVICE THEN I WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED CANVAS HD."
Galaxy Grand,3,"GOOD PRODUCT AT THIS PRICE.
      
      THOUGH I HAVE BAD EXPERIENCE WITH SAMSUNG OF SELLING DEFECTIVE PHONE TO MY SON AND DENIED FOR REPLACEMENT THOUGH THEY CONFIRMED OVER PHONE AND STILL PHONE IS LYING WITH SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER.
      
      HOWEVER I LIKED THIS PHONE AT VALUE FOR MONEY. I HAVE SAMSUNG NOTE II WHICH IS AMAZING BUT AT ALMOST HALF PRICE GRAND DUOS IS A GOOD BARGAIN."
Galaxy Grand,3,GOOGLE NEXUS 4 IS ON ITS WAY TO INDIA.SO I ADVICE YOU GUYS TO WAIT FOR IT RATHER THAN GOING FOR THIS SAMSUNG'S LOW PERFORMANCE PHONE. IF ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS A ANDROID DEVICE WITH CAMERA FOR TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS AND POSTING THEM ON FACEBOOK YOU MAY VERY WELL GO WITH ANYTHING. IF YOU SERIOUSLY ARE GEEKY AND CARE ABOUT PERFORMANCE I ADVICE YOU TO WAIT
Galaxy Grand,3,"GUYS I AM USING BOTH GRAND AS WELL AS NOTE 2. DON'T EVEN TRY TO COMPARE THESE 2 PHONES. NOTE 2 IS FAR FAR SUPERIOR THAN GRAND IN ALL OTHER ASPECTS EXCEPT CAMERA MEGA PIXELS!!!
      
      
      DUAL CORE AND QUAD CORE ENGINES, DISPLAY QUALITY, RAM, INBUILT MEMORY, NFC(IN NOTE 2) WILL MAKE LOT OF DIFFERENCE.
      
      
      I AM NOT SAYING GRAND IS BAD. BUT, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOTE2 AND GRAND IS EQUAL TO THE DISTANCE FROM EARTH TO SUN !!!!!"
Galaxy Grand,3,"GUYZ ... THIS IS DEFINATELY A GOOD PHONE BUT VERY LESS FEATURES THAN ITS PREDESSORS.

      LCD DISPLAY IS NOT ATTRACTIVE
      
      LOW MEMORY
      
      VERY FUGILE

      LET ME TELL U .. I LOVE PLAYING GAMES AND HAVE PLAYED ALL D GAMES YOU HAVE MENTIONED IN YOUR POST.. BUT BELIEVE THIS PHONE HAS NEVER STUCK
      
      
      I USE MANY APPS ON MY PHONE AND DOWNLOAD AN ALMOST EVERY DAY AND BELIEVE IT NEVER GAVE ME A BAD EXPERIENCE.. I THINK THE MICROMAX U HAVE IS DEFINATELY DEFECTIVE OR MAY BE U R JST ASSUMING THESE THINGS...
      
      
      ALL MY FRIENDS USE MICROMAX AND ARE MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH ALL THE FEATURE..

      I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A LOW BUDGET ON PHONE KIND OF A PERSON AS SUB 10K S.PHONES SERVES MOST OF THE MOST USED FUNCTIONALITY THAT THESE PHONE CAN BE USED FOR. FINALLY I DECIDED TO RAISE THE BAR GET ON WITH 20 K+ PHONE (HAVE USED MICROMAX CANVAS 2, ITS SPEAKER BUSTED AND THANKS TO FLIPKART THEY TOOK IT BACK, I LOVE THEM FOR IT) WHICH I BOUGHT FROM FK AGAIN (I LOVE THEM). I SHOULD SAY I WAS EXCITED TO TAKE THIS BLUE PIECE OF SMART EQUIPMENT IN MY HAND, GIVES YOU BETTER FEELING AND IT WORKED REALLY WELL FOR FIRST TWO DAYS. THE MOMENT I GOT USED TO SWIFT TOUCHES AND SLIDES THIS THING OFFERS AND STARTED FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT, ITS PERFORMANCE STARTED DROPPING, I HAVE BEEN FACING ERRATIC BEHAVIOR. I PRESS CONTACTS AND IT TAKES ANYWHERE BETWEEN 3 TO 4 SECONDS, I TRY PLAYING TENNIS (STP) AND I GET ISSUES, I TRY SWAPPING BETWEEN HOME SCREENS IT JUST GETS STUCK FOR 1 TO 2 SECONDS, I AM TRYING FEW THINGS HERE AND HOPE THIS GETS BETTER ELSE FLIPKART WILL HAVE TO SAVE ME HERE..AND THIS TIME I WILL GO WITH I-PHONE. SAMSUNG YOU MIGHT END UP LOSSING ONE OF YOUR OLDEST CUSTOMERS! BUT FLIPKART WON'T"
Galaxy Grand,3,HEY FRIENDS I JUST BOUGHT THIS PHONE. FOUND THIS PHONE EXCELLENT IN ALL MATTERS. BUT STILL THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IN NOT AS GOOD DURING THE CAMERA OPTION. AND ALSO THE GAME SUBWAY SURFERS IS STILL NOT SUPPORTED FOR THIS PHONE. IT SHOWS FEW PROBLEMS WHILE PLAYING DURING THE GAME AFTER THE GAME IS INSTALLED.
Galaxy Grand,3,"HI GUYS ,
      
      FEATURES WISE AND DISPLAY SCREEN WISE GRAND IS THE BEST(ALSO INCLUDES MULTIWINDOW FEATURE) , BUT ONLY PROB IS PROCESSOR . SAMSUNG FIRST TIME INTRODUCING BROADCOM CHIP-SET WHICH IS REDUCE DEVELOPMENT COST SO WE R GETTING GRAND AT LOW PRICE.
      
      
      WE CAN'T EXPECT 1.4GHZ QUADCORE EXP AT THIS COST. ONE MORE FACT ABOUT DISPLAY IT IS HDPI RES FAMILY WITH LCD BUT NOT AMOLED BUT STILL BETTER QUALITY IF COMPARE OTHER PHONES AT THIS COST. GAMING LOVERS WILL GET DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE OF 1.2GHZ  PROCESSOR. FINALLY AT THIS LOW PRICE THIS IS BEST SMART PHONE FROM SAMSUNG."
Galaxy Grand,3,"HI I HAD PURCHASED YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE APRIL DURING OFFER OF 15% CASHBACK AND 12MONTHS EMI OPTIONS FROM STANDARD CHARTERED BANK CREDIT CARD. ITS ALMOST 20DAYS OVER TILL NOW THE AMOUNT IN THE CREDIT CARD HAS NOT BEEN CONVERTED IN TO 12 EMI AND THE CASH BACK AS WELL DIDNT RECIEVED. CAN YOU PLEASE SOLVE ME THIS ISSUE ASAP.

Galaxy Grand,3,"I  WAS LOOKING FOR A MID RANGE SMART PHONE. ON GRAND LAUNCH I FELT I FINALLY FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AT HIS PRICE POINT. BUT BEFORE I TAKE THE PLUNGE THOUGHT WILL CHECK IT ALL STORES. AFTER DOING 4 TO 5 HANDS ON EXPERIENCE FELT ITS A BIT BULKY.
      
      
      SPECS ARE GREAT, NO SECOND THOUGHTS ON THAT. BUT SCREEN SIZE OF 5 INCHES WITH WVGA IS NOT THAT GREAT. IF YOU COMPARE 4 INCH WVGA VS 5INCH WVGA, YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE FOR ITSELF, FRANKLY ITS DISAPPOINTING. AND EVERYONE WILL USE THE PHONE FROM 16 TO 20 INCHES FROM ONES EYES IRRESPECTIVE HOW BIG THE PHONE IS, WE DONT HAVE VERY LONG HANDS DO WE ;-). SO DISPLAY DEPARTMENT IS THE SORE POINT. THE ICONS FEEL A LITTLE WASHED OUT. IDEALLY SAMSUNG COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS A QHD OR LITTLE BIT BETTER AND MINUS ONE SIM SLOT TO KEEP COSTS DOWN. OR COULD HAVE KEPT IT A 4 INCHES OR 4.25 INCHES SO PPI IS STILL BETTER WITH THE SAME WVGA. WHEN YOU BUY A BIG SCREEN PHONE THE PRIMARY REASON IS DISPLAY SHOULD BE GREAT, BUT GIVEN THE REST OF THE SPECS ITS GREAT.
      
      
      ALSO THIS PHONE IS QUITE THICK AND BULKY TOO, I FELT S3 SIZE WAS PERFECT COMPARED TO THIS ONE., BUT CAN LIVE WITH THAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO HAVE A LOOK PHYSICALLY BEFORE TAKING THE PLUNGE."
Galaxy Grand,3,I AM NOT A CERTIFIED BUYER NOR HAVE PERSONALLY USED THE PHONE. BUT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GOOD DUAL SIM SMART PHONE FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. AND I HAVE ONCE AGAIN BEEN DISAPPOINTED. THEY ALWAYS LEAVE SOME QUALITY FEATURES IN THE DUAL SIM MODELS - GOD KNOWS WHY! THIS ONE AGAIN DOES NOT HAVE A GORILLA GLASS SCREEN WHICH MAKES THIS SCREEN VERY VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE SPECIALLY BEING SUCH A LARGE SCREEN!!
Galaxy Grand,3,I AM SUPER HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE. IT HAS A HUGE DISPLAY AND ALLOWS ME TO READ A BOOK EASILY. THE AUDIO QUALITY IS ALSO SPLENDID. A MUST BUY FOR SAMSUNG LOVER! ONLY DISADVANTAGE IS BATTERY LIFETIME. IT RUNS OUT OF POWER QUICKLY.
Galaxy Grand,3,"I AM USING GALAXY GRAND SINCE AROUND ONE MONTH. THE ONLY PROBLEM I FELT IS THE RAM.
      
      IN 1GB RAM 804MB IS ONLY USABLE. FROM THIS ANDROID WILL TAKE AROUND 480-500MB.
      
      
      THE REALITY IS,  325MB(+-10MB) OF RAM  IS ONLY FREE FOR APPS.
      
      
      MANY TIME, I GOT ""MEMORY LOW""  WARNINGS.
      
      ALL OTHER FEATURES ARE WORTH FOR MONEY. I LIKE THIS PHONE EXCEPT THIS RAM PROBLEM.
      
      (-2 STARS BECAUSE OF RAM)"
Galaxy Grand,3,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM 2 MONTHS.  THERE ARE BOTH PRO'S AND CON'S BUT I RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE LOOKING AT THE PRICE BAND TO GO FOR IT.
      
      
      BATTERY IS NOT THAT GREAT. FOR SOME IT IS GIVING MORE THAN 2 DAYS FOR ME 1 DAY. MAY BE I NEED TO BUY NEW BATTERY AND TRY.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE, SOMETIMES (RARELY) ALL APPLICATIONS ENDS UP :) AND NOT THAT FAST SPEED FOR BROWSING AND ALL.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE NOT USING MUCH FOR GAMES, BROWSING AND JUST TO KEEP STYLISH U CAN GO WITH THIS PRODUCT.
      
      
      I RECOMMEND TO THOSE WHO DONT CARE ABOUT BELOW THINGS TO GO WITH:
      
      1. SIZE IS LITTLE BIGGER - 5 INCH
      
      2. SPEED IS AVERAGE, SOMETIMES IT HANGS
      
      3. BATTERY IS ONE DAY, MAX 30 HOURS ON AVERAGE USAGE.
      
      
      THATS ALL. I FEEL THIS IS GOOD PHONE TO BUY."
Galaxy Grand,3,"I BOUGHT CANVAS HD 2 MONTHS AGO AND GALAXY GRAND RECENTLY. BUT BELIEVE ME, IF YOU ARE NOT A BRAND SUCKER YOU MUST GO FOR CANVAS HD.
      
      I GOT GRAND IN RS. 16624 FROM FLIPKART (ITS OK FOR THIS PRICE ONLY). NOW IT COSTS NEARLY 19K (VERY UNREASONABLE). ALTHOUGH ITS A NICE PHONE AS PER THE SPECIFICATIONS BUT IT CANNOT COMPETE WITH CANVAS HD."
Galaxy Grand,3,"I BOUGHT IT PHONE YESTERDAY FROM SAMSUNG SMART CAFE FOR A SIMILAR PRICE. THE SIZE, LOOKS WERE APPEALING BUT I THINK I HAVE MADE A MISTAKE. I WENT TO BUY LUMIA 820 BUT SETTLED FOR GRAND CAUSE OF ITS DISPLAY SIZE.
      
      
      AFTER A DAY OF TESTING AND USING IT, I CAN VERY WELL SAY THAT IT'S TOUGH TO USE A 5"" PHONE. YOU LL HAVE TO USE BOTH YOUR HANDS AND AT TIMES IT NOT CONFORMABLE. THE RESOLUTION IS LOW BUT SAMSUNG HAS DONE WELL TO COUNTER THAT ISSUE WITH SOME 'CLEAR' DISPLAY.
      
      
      I SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR LUMIA 829 AND AM REGRETTING MY DECISION. ANDROID IS USUAL AND NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT JELLY BEAN(I COME FROM GINGERBREAD).
      
      
      BIG DISPLAYS DONT MAKE A BETTER DEVICE. THINK BEFORE YOU MAKE A MOVE. CHOOSE A PHONES INSTEAD WHICH IS EASY TO HOLD WITH HIGH PPI. SLOWLY BUT STEADILY WINDOWS PHONES WILL RISE.
      
      WHY? BECAUSE THEY DONT MAKE COMPROMISES ON HARDWARE.
      
      
      GRAND IS FULL OF COMPROMISES. CAMERA IS AVERAGE AND FPS IS VERY LOW. SILVER LINING:DUAL SIM CAPABILITY AND GOOD LOOKS."
Galaxy Grand,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AS MY REQUIREMENT WAS A DUAL SIM PHONE. ITS BEEN 3 DAYS SINCE I HAVE RECEIVED THE PRODUCT AND I CAN SAY THAT THE PHONE IS VERY ORDINARY. PHONE PERFORMANCE IS ALSO NOTHING MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THE PHONE EVERY DAY WITHOUT FAIL EVEN IF THE USAGE IS NOT HEAVY.
      
      
      FLIPKART WAS VERY PROMPT AND I KEEP GETTING IMPRESSED BY THEM TIME AND AGAIN AS THIS PHONE WAS DELIVERED WITHIN 24HRS OF LOGGING THE ORDER.
      
      
      AWESOME SERVICE!!!"
Galaxy Grand,3,I BROUGHT THIS PHONE LAST MONTH BUT WHEN I SEE GALARY OR PLAYING GAME PHONE IS GETTING LITTLE BIT STRUCKING BUT IF YOU WANT 5 INCHS SCREESN WITH GOOD LOOKING THEN GO FOR THIS PHONE.IF YOU USE LOT OF APP AND GAMES DONT BUY THIS PHONE PROCESSOR AND RAM IS NOT SUPPROTING HIGHT END GAMES AND APPS.
Galaxy Grand,3,"I HAVE BEEN READING MANY REVIEWS AND COMMENTS OF MICRO MAX AND SAMSUNG HANDSETS.. FIRST OF ALL MICROMAX MUST ADMIT GIVES VALUE FOR MONEY SELLING CHEAP HANDSET,BUT ITS NO COMPARISON TO ANY SAMSUNG HANDSET.. ITS LIKE COMPARING CHALK (MICROMAX) WITH CHEESE (SAMSUNG) I HAVE NEVER USED A SAMSUNG HANDSET ,BUT THE FEW THAT I HAVE TOUCHED CAN BEST BE COMPARED TO BRANDS LIKE APPLE,NOKIA, SONY.
      
      I WOULD PLACE A MICROMAX HANDSET IN THE COMPETITION WITH KARBON,SPICE ETC.
      
      
      I OWN A MICROMAX A75,..ITS DEFINITELY A ANDROID HANDSET,BUT GOOD ENOUGH ONLY FOR A HANDSET TO MAKE CALLS SEND SMS ETC AND NOTHING MORE.
      
      IT LAGS,CANNOT PLAY A PROPER GAME,CRAZY BIRD DRIVES YOU CRAZY,AND IF PLAYING TEMPLE RUN 2 ON IT,IF THERE WAS A GANE CALLED TEMPLE WALK,IT WOULD HAVE PERFORMED BETTER ON ANOTHER HANDSET.
      
      RIGHTLY SAID BY A FEW OTHERS.IT TAKES ABT 30 SECONDS TO PULL UP THE CALL LOG. IT KEEPS LOADING AND NEED TO WAIT FOR ABOUT A MINUTE AT TIME TO BRING UP THE MAIN MENU.
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY IS A TRAGEDY..HONESTLY I PAID 8K FOR CRAP.
      
      
      SO DEAR FRIENDS PLEAS DON'T COMPARE A MICROMAX TO A SAMSUNG... AND IF YOU GENUINELY WANTS TO COMPARE THE TWO PHONES..TRY THIS FIRST..  EAT CHALK AND THEN TASTE CHEESE."
Galaxy Grand,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING MY SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND I9082 SINCE TWO WEEKS NOW. THE FEATURES ARE COOL, PRICE IS OKAY BUT COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LESS. THERE'S A LOT HULLABOO ABOUT POOR DISPLAY RESOLUTION BUT I COULD NOT SEE IT AFFECTING ME IN ANY WAY. THE PHONE PERFORMS QUIET WELL, HANDLES 3G WITH EASE AND SPEED. MOST OF THE GAMES I PLAYED WORK NICELY. THE CAMERA QUALITY IS AWESOME AND VIDEO PLAYBACK TOO IS VERY NICE.
      
      
      HAVING SAID ALL THIS, THE LAST TWO WEEKS OFFERED DISAPPOINTMENT IN AREAS WHICH I NEVER ANTICIPATED. THIS PHONE HANGS A LOT. ON AN AVERAGE 1-2 TIMEAS A DAY. MOST OF THE TIMES I HAD TO DO A HARD RESET (REMOVING AND INSERTING THE BATTERY AGAIN). AT THAT TIME PEOPLE CALLING ME WOULD LISTEN THE TONE IN THEIR PHONE BUT THE PHONE WONT RING. NEITHER WOULD THE CALLER'S DETAILS GET CAPTURED IN THE PHONE AND THAT CALL WOULD GET LOST.
      
      COMING ONTO DISPLAY, IN SUNLIGHT EVEN WITH MAXIMUM BRIGHTNESS, THE DISPLAY WONT BE VISIBLE.
      
      
      I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THIS PHONE SINCE IT HAS A LOT OF COOL FEATURES AND ANTICIPATING THAT SAMSUNG WOULD BRING A SOFTWARE UPDATE FOR ITS HANGING ISSUE SHORTLY.
      
      
      GIVING 3 STARS FOR NOW. CUT 1 STAR JUST BECAUSE OF THE HANG ISSUE."
Galaxy Grand,3,"I HAVE GOT THIS FOR LAST WEEK AND THE PHONE IS GOOD MEANS FEATURES ARE REALLY IMPRESSIVE. BUT ONE THING I WANT TO CLEAR YOU ALL THAT IT HAS ONLY 4GB MEMORY FOR OUR USE BUT SAMSUNG CLAIMS IT TO BE 8GB BUT WHEN I CHECKED I GOT ONLY 3.93GB THIS IS THE THING WHICH MAKES SAMSUNG NON-TRUST-ABLE THEN NOKIA AND HTC.
      
      BUT APART FROM THIS PHONE IS GOOD BECAUSE DISPLAY IS AWESOME AND YOU GOT DUAL SIM SLOT. CAMERA IS SO..SO..NOT VERY GOOD."
Galaxy Grand,3,"I HAVE HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE THAT IF YOU WNAT TO DOWNLOAD MANY APPS ON A JELLY BEAN PHONE........2GB RAM IS MINIMUM REQUIRED, BECAUSE JELLY BEAN ITSELF USES LOT OF RAM COMPARED TO ICS, TO RUN SMOOTHLY.
      
      
      SO HOW IS THE EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE USING THIS PHONE OR ANY OTHER JELLY BEAN PHONE WITH 1GB RAM?"
Galaxy Grand,3,I HAVE USED THIS CELL BUT ITS NOT SOOD NOR SO BAD..I HAVE USED THIS CELL BUT ITS NOT SOOD NOR SO BAD..I HAVE USED THIS CELL BUT ITS NOT SOOD NOR SO BAD..I HAVE USED THIS CELL BUT ITS NOT SOOD NOR SO BAD..
Galaxy Grand,3,"I LOVED THE SERVICE &AMP; CUSTOMER SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE FLIPKART...ONE CANNOT EXPECT MORE THEN THIS.
      
      HOWEVER I DID NOT LIKED THE PRODUCT FROM SAMSUNG. IT IS NOT THE VALUE FOR MONEY. DISPLAY &AMP; SOUND IS NOT GOOD.
      
      
      SUGGEST TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER OPTION."
Galaxy Grand,3,I M USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST 2 MONTHS..ONE THING I HAVE NOTICED THAT THIS FONE HANGS A LOT AND WHEN IT HANGS ...U HAVE TO REMOVE THE BATTERY TO BRING IT BACK TO NORMAL AND RESTART IT.SECONDLY THE SCREEN IS NOT SO GOOD LIKE GALAXY ACE DUOS...OVERALL 5 OUT OF 10.
Galaxy Grand,3,"I PURCHASED GRAND ON 2ND FEB. IN STARTING IT WAS AWESOME BUT WHEN I DOWNLOADED SOME APPLICATIONS IT GOES SLOW. SLIDES OPEN VERY SLOW AND PROCESSOR IS ALSO SLOW.
      
      
      I WENT IN SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE TODAY AND THEY SAID THAT THE PHONE HAS SOME PROBLEM WITH PROCESSOR AND SAMSUNG SHOULD IMPROVE BUT NOW WHAT,...... I HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED THE MOBILE AND IF ITS NOT ABLE TO DOWANLOD APPLICATION AND WORK FAST THEN HOW ITS USE TO BUY IT.
      
      
      TOTALLY DISPPOINTED WITH THE CAMERA QUALITY &AMP;  PROCESSOR.
      
      
      HEMANT"
Galaxy Grand,3,I WOULD RECOMMEND ALL OF YOU TO WAIT FOR A LIKE A MONTH OR SO BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS PHONE...IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE PRICE OF THE PHONE WOULD FALL DOWN BY 3K (CAUSE SAMSUNG HAS INCLUDED FLIP COVER AND OTHER INTRODUCTORY OFFERS WITH THE PHONES WHICH WOULD BE DISCONTINUED) MEANWHILE MICROMAX WOULD BE LAUNCHING CANVAS HD AND 2-3 OTHER PHONES...IN A MONTH YOU WOULD HAVE BETTER CHOICES!!!
Galaxy Grand,3,"IN PREVIOUS REVIEWS, HAVE READ SOME1 COMPARING GRAND FROM SOME UMIX2.... IF SPEAKING FRANKLY NEVER HEARD THIS MOBILE NAME ALSO..... ND THAT ALSO THEY R GOIN TO SELL THT PHONE IN 14K.... IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG WHERE SOME1 WILL TAKE IT FOR REPAIR......
      
      
      DO U HAVE ANY IDEA UMI SUPPORTER?????"

Galaxy Grand,3,"MICROMAX A116 HD IS BEING SOLD AT A PRICE MORE THAN IT IS WORTH NOW. IT STARTED SELLING AT 13999.

AND IT IS STILL BEING SOLD AT A HIGHER PRICE 16000 AND ABOVE.
      
      
      NOW SAMSUNG GRAND IS AVAILABLE FOR RS. 17765 (15% CASHBACK)- SO WHY BUY MICROMAX WHEN THIS PHONE IS AVAILABLE FOR LESS THAN 2000 MORE.

      1) LOADS OF FEATURES

      1) THE BATTERY COVER IS OF VERY LOW QUALITY.
      
      2) ON THE BOX YOU SEE A VODAFONE OFFER THAT SAYS 2GB 3G DATA FREE. PROBLEM 1: THIS IS APPLICABLE ONLY IF VODAFONE IS THE FIRST SIM YOU PUT IN THE SIM 1 SLOT. PROBLEM 2: VODAFONE 3G LICENSE IS SUSPENDED FOR THE MOMENT. AND SAMSUNG DOESN'T CARE TO REVIEW THE OFFER.

Galaxy Grand,3,"RAM OF THIS DEVICE IS ONLY 804 MBS... EVEN THOUGH IF I AM NOT RUNNING ANY APPS(ZERO APPS) THE  RAM USED IS 400MBS, SO WE LEFT WITH ONLY 404 MBS OF RAM.

Galaxy Grand,3,"RECEIVED THIS PHONE ON THE 6TH OF FEB. IT WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL, WAS SO GLAD USING A 5"" PHONE, THOUGH  I FOUND IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE THE PHONE WITH ITS FLIP COVER, BUT LATER ON IT BECAME A HABIT. I USED TO FEEL LOST W/O IT AS IT HAS ALL THE REQUIREMENTS IN IT.
      
      THE FREE VODAFONE 2G 3G  USEAGE, DROPBOX , MY SERVICES  PACKAGE WITH A LOT OF  MOVIES, EDUCATION, SONGS  ETC. WHEN MY FRIENDS SAW THE PHONE THEY ALL LOVED IT AND I WAS PROUD TO POSSESS IT.
      
      THE DRAWBACK NOW  THIS PHONE ON USING WAS GETTING HANGED. THIS HAPPENED A NO OF TIMES WITHIN A SPAN OF 19 DAYS. WHEN I COMPLAINED ABOUT IT THE SD CARD WAS BLAMED. THIS SANDISK CARD WAS CHECKED  AT THEIR SERVICE CENTER AND WAS FOUND OK. FINALLY ON 28TH FLIKART DID REPLACE MY PHONE, AND I WAS GLAD TO RECEIVE THE NEW PHONE.
      
      THIS  PHONE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND EVEN WORSE THE SCREEN WOULD  GO OFF FOR  A SPLIT SECOND AND COME BACK. THIS PHONE ALSO GETS HANGED SO FINALLY I AGAIN COMPLAINED TO FLIPKART AND THEY IMMEDIATELY  INFORMED ME FOR THE COLLECTION OF THE PHONE  REPAYING MY AMOUNT TO ME.
      
      WILL SAMSUNG COMPANY OR ITS SERVICE CENTER LOOK INTO THIS PHONE AND TRY TO FIND OUT  WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES. IT MAY BE  THAT MANY OTHER PHONES MAY BE GETTING  HANGED DUE TO FAULTY PROCESSOR OR OTHER TECHNICAL FAULT, BUT ARE ASHAMED TO  TELL THEIR FRIENDS THAT MY GRAND IS GETTING HANGED.
      
      ALSO APPS CANNOT BE SHIFTED  TO THE SD CARD, REASON EXPLAINED BY THE SAMSUNG SHOP THAT BECAUSE OF JELLYBEAN OS IT CANNOT SHIFT.
      
      IF IT WAS NOT FOR HANGING THIS PHONE WAS MARVELOUS."

      1) GOOD DISPLAY: THOUGHT I HAD PROBLEMS WITH SCREEN COLORS FADING AFTER A CONTINUOUS USE OF 15-20 MINS
      
      2) GOOD PERFORMANCE
      
      3) GOOD AUDIO\VIDEO PLAYBACK
      
      4) GOOD FOR READING \ BROWSING"
Galaxy Grand,3,"THE PHONE MAY BE GOOD. BUT THE PRICE OF THE PHONE IS ON HIGH SIDE.  SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS SHOULD DECREASE THEIR MOBILE PRICES TO BEAT NOKIA OR ANY OTHER CONTEMPORARY BRAND. IF THE PRICE IS LESS, THE PHONE MIGHT BE IN MY HAND."
Galaxy Grand,3,THE RESOLUTION OF THIS PHONE IS NOT WELL GOOD ... IT SHOULD BE HD LIKE 1080 X 800 AS COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES AND ITS TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT AMOLED WHILE OTHER PHONE OF THIS PRICE HAS SUCH FEATURES IN THIS PRICE. OTHER FEATURES ARE GOOD ..
Galaxy Grand,3,"THIS PHONE SPECS LOOK GOOD. AND THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS NOT A PROBLEM, UNTIL YOU ARE TAKING PICTURES AND REVIEWING THEM. AT THAT POINT, YOU START TO SEE THE SCREEN LIMITATION.
      
      
      DID ANYONE BUY THE BLUE METALLIC MODEL? DOES IT COME WITH WHITE FLIP COVER OR BLACK ONE?"
Galaxy Grand,2,"AROUND 23DAYS BACK I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND IT REALLY SUCKS
      
      REASONS
      
      
      1 IT GETS HOT OR HEATED AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT ANY REASON
      
      2 IT HANGS AUTOMATICALLY
      
      3 SOME TIMES CAMERA GET HUNG UP AND NEVER OPENS
      
      REALLY FED UP WITH THIS"
Galaxy Grand,2,"AS USUAL FLIPKART ROCKS, I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT ON THRUSDAY AND FLIPKART DELIVER IT TO ME ON NEXT DAY.
      
      
      ABOUT PHONE, PHONE IS GOOD AND LIGHTWEIGHT. AND FULL FILL ALL MY REQUIREMENTS THAT I WAS THINKING WITH NOTE2.
      
      
      GREAT PHONE AND GREAT DEAL."
Galaxy Grand,2,"BEFORE PURCHASING GALAXY GRAND ...I WAS REALLY VERY EXCITED TO HAVE THIS SO CALLED ""GRAND EXPERIENCE""...BUT FRANKLY SPEAKING ;NOW I AM TOTALLY FED UP WID THE DEVICE BECAUSE OF THIS ""HANGING PROBLEM"".
      
      EVERY DAY,I MEAN IT,EVERY SINGLE DAY AT ANY INSTANCE OF TIME MY PHONE GETS HANGED UP;SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN I UNLOCK MY DEVICE.LET ME BE CLEAR..""IT IS NOT APPLICATION SPECIFIC PROBLEM""(AS SAMSUNG GUYS MUST BE BLAMING).
      
      ONE MORE THING;SOUND QUALITY IS TOO POOR MAN.....IF U THINK MY SONGS MUST BE OF LOWER BIT RATE..THINK AGAIN....BECAUSE I CHECKED IT ON SAMSUNG PRE-LOADED RINGTONES/ALARMTONES TOO....THE SOUND TEARING.
      
      ALSO ONE MORE PROBLEM IS THERE;WHEN I MAKE A CALL FROM MY PHONE,AT TIMES I HEAR NOTHING AT ALL;I MEAN NO RINGING NOTHING..BUT THE CALL IS ACTUALLY GOING ON OTHER SIDE AND EVEN IF A PERSON PICKS PHONE ON THE OTHER SIDE....YOU HEAR NOTHING AT ALL.
      
      THIS IS JUST A SHAME ON ""SAMSUNG"" THAT THEY ARE BRINGING SUCH POORLY TESTED DEVICES IN MARKET,JUST TO MAKE FOOL OF WE AS CUSTOMERS.
      
      IN SHORT ...... A BIG NO NO TO THIS DEVICE......HANG HANG HANG!!!"
Galaxy Grand,2,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE A WEEK AGO AND WAS HAPPY WITH IT TILL I WENT ON TO TRY &AMP; INSTALL GAMES LIKE VECTOR &AMP; SUBWAY SURFER ON IT. GOOGLE PLAY STORE WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS DEVICE IS INCOMPATIBLE TO INSTALL SUBWAY SURFER AND VECTOR WOULD RUN LIKE A SLOW MOTION BLACK &AMP; WHITE MOVIE... REASON... NO GRAPHICS CARD.... COMEON SAMSUNG, ITS ONE OF YOUR HIGH END PHONES AND YOU DIDN'T THINK OF PROVIDING A GRAPHICS CARD OR HIGHER ROM LIKE YOUR MID RANGE GALAXY S ADVANCE.... A WEEK LATER, THE PHONE IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO LAG AND SAMSUNG HAS LAUNCHED ITS UPGRADED QUAD CORE VERSION, THATS A RIPPER. BUYING A 21K PHONE, YOU'D EXPECT TO HAVE EVRYTHING INCLUDING MORE RAM, HIGHER INTERNAL STORAGE AND BETTER PROCESSOR RATHER THAN JUST THE BETTER CAMERA PIXELS.
      
      A DISAPPOINTING PURCHASE BUT I'LL BE STUCK WITH IT FOR A WHILE CAUSE YOU CAN'T SPEND 20K ODD CURRENCY ON PHONES. IF THIS WAS THE PERFORMANCE SAMSUNG WAS OFFERING ON A 21K PHONE, THEN I'D SAY MICROMAX CANVAS HD WOULD BE A MORE ECONOMICAL CHOICE. AND GUYS THE INTRODUCTORY PACKAGE WORTH 10990 IS AN EYE WASH, DON'T FALL FOR IT. THE 15% CASH BACK OFFER ALSO APPEARS TO BE A STOCK CLEARANCE SALE NOW AS THEY LAUNCHED SAMSUNG GALXY WIN DUOS AND SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND QUATTRO ON 1 MAY 2013, A DAY AFTER THE CASH BACK OFFER WAS SUPPOSED TO END. DAMN YOU SAMSUNG!!!"
Galaxy Grand,2,"DISPLAY IS TOO BAD, DO HANDS ON BEFORE BUYING.
      
      ONLY ADVANTAGE IS OF SIZE AND SPECS BUT THE PICTURE QUALITY AND RESOLUTION IS TOTALLY WASTE OF MONEY FOR THIS PHONE. SO IF YOU WANT THE BETTER PHONE GO FOR S3."
Galaxy Grand,2,DISPLAY QUALITY IS NOT UP TO MARK.A WVGA DISPLAY IN D ERA OF HD DISPLAY.....NO ONE WANTS TO SPEND 21K FOR DIS TYPE OF DISPLAY QUALITY WHEN MICROMAX IS GOING TO LAUNCH A116 WITH SAME FEATURE AND HD DISPLAY .. I WILL SUGGEST TO GO FOR A116 RATHER THAN THIS ONE.
Galaxy Grand,2,"DONT EVER BUY THIS PHONE . THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE JELLY BEAN EXCEPT THE MULTI WINDOW. OTHER WISE IT IS SAME AS ICE CREAM SANDWICH. YOU SHOULD BUY THE CANVAS HD. IT IS WAY MORE POWERFUL.THE GRAND HAS DUAL CORES BUT THE HD HAS QUAD CORES. PLUS IT IS ALSO CHEAPER.CAMERA IS SAME TOO. ONLY THE MEMORY IS A ISSUE.
      
      THE GRAND COSTS 19K WHILE THE HD COSTS 14K. 5K LESS. WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING FOR"
Galaxy Grand,2,"EVEN HAVING THE HIGH END HARDWARE CONFIGURATION, IT'S TOO SLOW. ONLY GOOD THING IS HD PLAYBACK AND LARGE SCREEN, MY SUGGESTION IS GO FOR SOME HTC PHONE.......      .          .                          ."
Galaxy Grand,2,GETTING AN AWESOME GALAXY FOR JUST 21500 . THAT SOUNDS PRETTY DAMN COOL . BUT FRIENDS IF YOU ARE THINKINP TO BUY IT THEN THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN . IT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY . I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT JUST TODAY AND I'M THINKING OF GIVING IT TO MY COUSIN AND TAKING HIS LUMIA . IT'S QUITE SLOW . AND APPS ALSO DON'T RUN QUITE WELL . BUT I'LL PRAISE THE CAMERA . IT'S FUCKING AWESOME . BUT FULLY . IT AIN'T A GOOD DEAL
Galaxy Grand,2,"HELLO,I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT IT HAS THE BRAND NAME OF SAMSUNG WHICH CAN NOT BE COMPARED WITH MICROMAX BUT MY FRIEND THE REASON WHY MMX IS CHEAP IS THAT BECAUSE IT IS AN   INDIAN COMPANY,SAMSUNG IS ALSO CHEAPER IN S.KOREA AND WHAT IS IN THIS PHONE THAT I DNT LYK:-
      
      
      1)ITS DISPLAY ISNT SO SHARP, I TRIED BOTH MMX CANVAS HD IN ONE HAND AND GRAND ON THE OTHER, THE CHEAP DISPLAY FELT LIKE IT WAS A 6-7K PHONE AND THE COLOR DEPTH WAS ALSO VERY BAD SERIOUSLY MY NOKIA 603(8K PHONE)WAS WAY BETTER IN TERMS OF DISPLAY
      
      
      2)DUAL CORE PROCESSOR,EACH AND EVERY PHONE IS COMING WITH QUAD CORE THESE DAYS,DUAL CORE NOWADAYS IS ONLY FOUND IN MUSEUM AND GALAXY GRAND BUT NONETHELESS I ACCEPT THAT ITS  DUAL CORE WORKS AS GOOD AS MEDIATEK(MMX) QUAD CORE BUT IT IS SO SIMPLE THAT IF YOU PAY 8K MORE YOU DO EXPECT MORE
      
      
      3)RAM 1GB AS I SAID EARLIER THAT IF PAY MORE YOU MUST GET MORE
      
      
      @PEOPLE-I HAVE TIME AND AGAIN TOLD IT THAT MICROMAX IS INDIAN SO IT IS CHEAP FIND PRICE OF SAMSUNG IN SOUTH KOREA AND THEN TALK AND STILL IF YOU THINK THAT THIS IS BETTER THEN YOU ARE A FOOL AND I THINK YOU WILL ONLY CONSIDER MICROMAX GOOD IF THEY ALSO START HIGH PRICING
      
      
      ANYWAY IF YOU DO NOT LIKE MICROMAX THEN ALSO THERE ARE SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVES OF BRANDS YOU PEOPLE MAY LIKE
      
      
      1)NOKIA LUMIA 820
      
      2)SONY XPERIA ION
      
      3)HTC DESIRE SV
      
      
      I HAVE ONLY REVIEWED AFTER GOING THROUGH MMX CANVAS HD,GRAND,LUMIA 820,XPERIA ION
      
      I DNT KNOW ABOUT HTC DESIRE SV BUT SPECS LOOK GOOD"
Galaxy Grand,2,"HEY GUYS, EVEN IF YOU ARE NEW SMART PHONE USER  AND WANT TO BUY A NEW PHONE, DONT GO FOR THIS..!!
      
      SAMSUNG ONCE AGAIN PROVED THAT, ITS MAKING SUCH LOW QUALITY PRODUCT TO COMPETE WITH LOCAL COMPANIES ( MICROMAX , KARBAN .. ETC). IT'S NOT AT ALL LOOKING FOR THE OUT STANDING COMPETITORS (SONY, HTC..). YES, THIS PHONE HAS GOT VERY GOOD LOOK ( TO CHEAT!!) BUT AS USUAL IT'S A SAMSUNG'S VERY POOR QUALITY PLASTIC BODY, SCREEN IS MAJOR TOPIC TO CONSIDER, VERY BAD RESOLUTION, YOU WILL FIND WHEN SEE YOUR PHOTOS TOOK BY OTHER MOBILE/CAM. WHEN YOU WATCH NON HD VIDEOS, YOU WILL FIND DIFFERENCE!! ITS TOO BAD VIEW IN THIS PHONE TO COMPARE TO MICROMAX CANVAS A110. I TOOK THIS MOBILE (OUT SIDE THE FLIPKART) BECAUSE OF IT'S CONFIGURATION BUT I SOLD IT OFF WITH IN TWO DAYS FOR (18K). DUE TO-
      
      -WE GET ONLY ~4GB USER SPACE, ~800MB RAM
      
      -WE CAN'T MOVE APPLICATION TO SD CARD!!
      
      -IT'S LOOKS BETTER THAN S3 BUT ITS NOT THAT MUCH HANDY TO HOLD COMPARE TO S3!
      
      -YOU CAN FIND THE REAL POORNESS OF THE CAMERA IN THIS PHONE WHEN YOU TAKE PICTURE OF HALF PART FULLY BRIGHT AND HALF PART FULLY DARK !!
      
      -THE ONLY OUTSIDE PIECE WITH WHITE FLIP COVER LOOKS GREAT WHEN GIRLS HOLDS IN HAND ! BUT FOR A BOYS ITS TOO IRRITATING TO USE WITH A FLIP COVER. AND ITS WIDTH IS MUCH HIGHER SO NOT THAT MUCH HANDY TO HANDLE IN SINGLE HAND !! SPECIALLY WHILE U EATING OR DRINKING.
      
      -THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IS, WHILE YOU WATCH SOCIAL MEDIAS, NOT ALL FRIENDS UPLOAD THE SLR CAMERA QUALITY PICTURES IN FACEBOOK!! SO FRIEND'S PHOTOS LOOKS VERY POOR, U LOSE THE BEAUTY OF THE ORIGINAL PICTURE BECAUSE OF THIS PSEUDO SMART PHONE! JUST THE PHONE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL BUT IT KILLS THE REAL BEAUTY OF YOUR PICTURES, WALL PAPERS, VIDEOS, THEMES ETC.
      
      -THE APPLICATION ICONS LOOKS TOO BIG AND LOSSES THE GLOSSINESS AND ACTUAL LOOK.
      
      -IN CASE OF MALTY TASK , ITS NOT MALTY, ITS ONLY TWO AT A TIME.
      
      -THE SOUND OUTPUT OF THE PHONE SPEAKER IS NOT THAT MUCH LOUDER AS OF S2.
      
      -THE PEOPLE ARE BUYING THIS MOBILE BECAUSE OF BRAND NAME. BUT SAMSUNG PEOPLE FORGOT THAT AND COMPROMISED IN MANY WAYS (DISPLAY, DEISIGN, NAMING A PHONE, SPECIALLY BACK COVER, CAMERA) EXCEPT SIMPLY GIVING A GOOD CONFIGURATION!
      
      ITS JUST A MATTER OF 5K TO MAKE A BETTER CHOICE OF OTHER HIGHER MODEL OR SAVE 10K USE MICROMAX!
      
      THIS IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO CONCERNS THE ABOVE FACTORS! REST CAN ENJOY THE PHONE !
      
      
      WAS THIS REVIEW HELPFUL? YES / NO"
Galaxy Grand,2,"HEY GUYS,EVEN IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE SMARTPHONE SEGMENT AND WANT TO BUY A NEW PHONE,DONT'T BUY THIS ONE..JUST THINK OF WHAT ALL PHONES ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.IT HAS GOT GOOD LOOKS,GOOD CAMERA,BUT OTHER THAN THAT??NOTHING,PLAINLY NOTHING!!JUST GO FOR MICROMAX A116 HD.SAMSUNG RELEASED THIS PHONE ONLY IN INDIA JUST TO COMPETE WITH OVERGROWING MICROMAX..MICROMAX A116 CANVAS HD!!JUST LOOK AT ITS SPECS..IT HAS GOT A CORTEX A7 1.2 GHZ PROCESSOR COMPARED TO 1.2GHZ OF THIS ONE..AND ABOUT THE DISPLAY,THIS HAS GOT A WVGA DISPLAY WHEREAS THE A116 GOT A STUNNING HD DISPLAY(1280*720).THE CANVAS HD IS ALSO RS15000 ONLY..MICROMAX IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER..THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING CAUSE THE INVESTMENT IS LARGE AND YOU MUST NEVER REGRET IN FUTURE.IF YOU ARE SKEPTICAL,JUST GO,GOOGLE MICROMAX A116 VS SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND..YOU'LL COME TO KNOW..IF YOU FIND MY REVIEW USEFUL,VOTE IT HIGH AND MAKE IT STAY ON TOP SO THAT OTHERS TOO FIND IT :)"
Galaxy Grand,2,HEY I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART LAST WEEK.FLIPKART SERVICE IS REALLY SO FAST ND SUPERB.BUT THE PHONE IS TOO BAD.I FACED MANY PROBLEN IN GRAND.IT HANGS MANY TIME. PROCESSING IS TOO SLOW.ND NOW I AM FACING THE CHARGING PROBLEM.SOME TIME PHN IS SHOWING CHARGING SOMETIMES NOT..SO I RECOMEND NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE
Galaxy Grand,2,HI GUYS THE WORST THING OF THIS FONE IS ITS BATTERY.IT DIE ONLY IN FEW 2-3 HRS GAMING..OR EVEN IT CAN'T GO TILL EVE FOR NORMAL USE IF FULLY CHARGED IN MORNING.OTHERWISE SOMEHOW IT CAN FULFILL UR REQUIREMENT.
Galaxy Grand,2,"HI,
      
      
      I DON'T OWN THIS PHONE BUT WRITING THIS TO TELL A FEW FACTS ABOUT A GRAND.
      
      
      FIRST THING I WANT TO ASK IS HOW EVERYONE WAS ABLE TO REVIEW EVEN WITHOUT USING IT.
      
      I AM NOT SAYING IT IS A BAD PHONE BUT PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE AND READ THE BELOW FACTS ABOUT THIS PHONE THAT I KNOW WHICH NOT EVEN SAMSUNG IS NOT SAYING IT.
      
      
      DISPLAY: WVGA RESOLUTION. THIS IS THE SAME RESOLUTION AS ON GALAXY S2. BUT THIS PHONE HAS 5 INCHES VERSUS 4.3 ON S2.
      
      DUE TO SAME RESOLUTION ON LARGE SCREEN THE DISPLAY WONT BE SHARP. QUALITY WILL BE DEFINITELY LESS COMPARED TO 2 YEAR OLD S2.
      
      THIS IS NOT SUPER AMOLED. THIS PHONE HAS JUST LCD DISPLAY. QUALITY OF LCD DISPLAY WILL BE VERY BAD. UNDER SUNLIGHT SUPER AMOLED IS NOT GOOD BUT GOOD IN INDOOR USAGE.
      
      LCD WILL BE WORSE IN BOTH SUNLIGHT AND INDOOR USAGE.
      
      
      PROCESSOR: ALL SAMSUNG IS SAYING THIS PHONE HAS 1.2 GHZ DUAL CORE. IN S2 IT HAS ITS OWN POPULAR EXYNOS PROCESSOR.
      
      GRAND HAS BROADCOMM PROCESSOR. THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST PHONE WITH THIS PROCESSOR. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A PHONE WITH BROADCOMM PROCESSOR. I AM NOT SAYING ITS BAD BUT WE DON'T KNOW UNTIL ITS REVIEWED.
      
      THE REASON FOR USING THAT PROCESSOR MUST BE CHEAP PRICE. OTHERWISE WHY WOULD SAMSUNG USE OTHER COMPANIES PROCESSOR INSTEAD OF USING ITS OWN PROCESSOR.
      
      
      TWO MOST IMPORTANT SPECS OF ANY PHONE IS PROCESSOR AND DISPLAY. THESE TWO THINGS ARE BAD COMPARED TO 2 YEAR OLD GALAXY S2.
      
      
      THE ONLY REASON THIS PHONE GOT ATTENTION OF PEOPLE IS BECAUSE OF ITS SCREEN SIZE (5 INCHES).
      
      
      SO BE CAREFUL AND THINK A LOT BEFORE BUYING.
      
      
      I AM GOING TO RATE THIS PHONE 2 STARS BECAUSE SAMSUNG IS HIDING THE FACTS ABOUT DISPLAY AND PROCESSOR."
Galaxy Grand,2,"I  BUY GALAXY GRAND DUOS  FROM AUTHORIZE SHOP. FACT ABOUT THE PHONES (CONS) ARE :-  1.IT SHOWS LOW MEMORY WHILE MUCH SPACE.
      
      2. IT HAS ONLY 4GB INTERNAL DISTRIBUTED MEMORY.
      
      3. NO FACILITY TO MOVE APPS ON EXTERNAL SD CARD.
      
      4.ALL APPS AND SCANNED DOCUMENTS SAVE ONLY INTERNAL STORAGE.
      
      5. NO SUPPORT FOR OTG CABLE WHILE MICROMAX PROVIDE THIS.
      
      6.DUAL SIM NOT ACTIVE. WE HAVE TO SELECT SIM IN SETTING.
      
      7.ONLY ONE SIM HAS 3G FACILITY.
      
      8.ONLY 802 MB RAM AVAILABLE.
      
      NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE (21000)."
Galaxy Grand,2,"I AM FACING SOME PROBLEMS LIKE PHONE HANG, TOUCH NOT WORKING , MOBILE NO GOES NOT UNREACHABLE. I AM IN A REGULAR CONTACT WITH YOUR COMPANY BUT EVERY TIME THEY SAY TO VISIT YOUR CUSTOMER CARE. SINCE I HAD VISITED  YOUR SERVICE CENTER THEY ONCE REPAIRED MY HANDSET BUT AGAIN THE SAME PROBLEM. DON'T UNDERSTAND  SAMSUNG POLICY. NO WORTH VALUE."
Galaxy Grand,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 3 WEEKS B4. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS DEVICE IS ITS BATTERY!!! WORST BATTERY !! DONT THINK THAT IF U ARE A MODERATE USER THEN BATTERY WILL LAST LONGER. I AM A MODERATE USER AND BATTERY SEEMS TO DRAIN IN JUST 6 HRS. SAMSUNG SHOULD GIVE  US A GOOD BATTERY ATLEAST OF 3300 MAH !!! IF POSSIBLE TELL ME I WONT MIND BUYING A NEW BATTERY COZ THIS DEVICE IS REALLY AWESOME! !
      
      REST THE PHONE IS AWESOME PERFORMANCE PACKED . SOMETIMES HANGS AND SCREEN TURNS BLACK FOREVER SO U HAVE TO REMOVE THE BATTERY AND RESTART. CAMERA AND ELSE AWESOME!! AWESOME REALLY MEANS AWESOME GUYS NEVER HAD SUCH SMARTPHONE EXPERIENCE IN ANY OTHER DEVICE.
      
      
      SAMSUNG LOOSES TO MOTOROLA IN BATTERY AND OTHER SMALL FEATURES LIKE GOOD DICTIONARY WHILE WRITING OR CORRECTION MEASURES WHILE TYPING. SOUND IS BEST IN MOTOROLA.
      
      BUT GRAND IS REALLY A GRAND PACKAGE WITH LEAST BATTERY LIFE."
Galaxy Grand,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER MY NOKIA N 8 STARTED TO SHOW SIGNS OF AGEING. HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO BUY S 3 BUT THOUGHT TO TRY THE NEW ENTRANT.SADLY AFTER ONE DAY OF BUYING IT , THE HANDSET DEVELOPED FEW SNAGS. THE SPEAKER AND HEADSET STOPPED WORKING TOTALLY AND THE BATTERY BACK UP WAS DISMA. I HAD TO GET THE HAND SET REPLACED AFTER A LOT OF STRUGGLE WITH THE SAMSUNG CAFE I BOUGHT IT FROM. THEY DID REPLACE THE SET AND AFTER TEN DAYS OF USING IT , THE SAME PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED AGAIN. I HAVE TO SWITCH OFF THE SET AND ON AGAIN FOR THE SPEAKER TO WORK. ALSO MY SET IS NOT PICKING UP ANY WI FI NETWORK IN SPITE OF SHOWING THAT IT IS CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK. EVEN THE MOBILE DATA NETWORK ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE ITS OWN WILL, IT WORKS SOMETIMES AND THEN GOES OFF. I AM TOTALLY FED UP AS I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO RUN TO SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS WHICH KEEP CROPPING UP. I THINK THE COMPANY HAS SHORTCHANGED THE BUYERS BY USING SUBSTANDARD PARTS TO KEEP THE COST DOWN. I WOULD SUGGEST THE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS TO BE CAREFUL BEFORE INVESTING 21500 RS. IN THIS PHONE !!"
Galaxy Grand,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN A LOCAL SAMSUNG STORE IN HYDERABAD.
      
      
      MY ISSUES WITH THIS PHONE -
      
      
      LAGGING - THE USER EXPERIENCE IS SO HORRIBLE . AFTER I INSTALLED A FEW GAMES,IT STARTED TO LAG HORRIBLY EVEN IN SOME BASIC GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN 2 AND SUBWAY SURFERS.
      
      EVEN WHEN I LOAD A FEW WIDGETS ON THE HOMESCREEN,IT LAGS OCCASIONALLY . THE FRAME RATES DROP EVENTUALLY .
      
      
      DISPLAY - WORST EVER
      
      THE DISPLAY IS WVGA , NOT SUPER AMOLED.
      
      NOT UP TO THE MARK AT ALL. WITH THE SCREEN BEING SO BIG,THE PIXELS ARE NOTICED  A LITTLE BIT.
      
      
      I AM REGRETTING THIS PHONE NOW,NOW I WANNA SELL IT AND GET SOME OTHER PHONE.
      
      
      PLEASE PLEASE DONT FALL FOR THIS PHONE.
      
      THE LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING."
Galaxy Grand,2,"I HAD BOUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND DUOS. ITS GOOD...BUT EMI CONVERTION NOT DONE TILL NOW(30-05-2013)..I DOESNOT KNOW WHEN EMI CONVERTION WILL DONE
      
      DATE OF PUCHESED 24-04-2013
      
      I HAVE BAD EXPIRIANCE FROM FLIPCART"
Galaxy Grand,2,"I JUST PURCHASED THE PHONE A WEEK AGO HAPPY WITH FLIPKART BUT NOT HAPPY WITH SAMSUNG,
      
      SMS TONES ARE BAD AND CAN'T BE CUSTOMIZED THAT MEANS YOU CAN ONLY USE DEFAULT TONES PREINSTALLED YOU WILL DEFINITELY MISS MOST IMPORTANT SMS.
      
      PHONE DOESN'T RING IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU RECEIVE A CALL, MEANS YOU WILL MISS THOSE MISS-CALLS OF YOUR SWEETHEART AND RELATIVES.
      
      -DISPLAY IS NOT VERY SHARP BUT IT IS ACCEPTABLE.
      
      -LOTS OF UNWANTED SPACE BETWEEN ICONS AND WIDGETS.
      
      -VOLUME KEY IMPACTS THE RINGTONE VOLUME IN STANDBY.
      
      -VIDEO CAMERA LOSES FOCUS WHILE RECORDING.
      
      -PHOTO CAMERA IS OK.
      
      -SPEED IS GOOD.
      
      -BATTERY IS OK BETTER THAN WHEN WE HEAR THE NAME OF SAMSUNG.
      
      
      ---IF THESE SMALL THINGS ARE IMPROVED AT LEAST THE SMS TONE SHOUD CUSTOMISED, LATE RINGING OF RINGTONE ON CALL  AND FOCUS ISSUE ON VIDEO RECORDING SHOULD BE FIXED IT WILL BEAT THE MARKET.---
      
      OVERALL ITS MY MISTAKE TO TRUST SAMSUNG,, NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE ITS THE FIRST AND LAST SAMSUNG PRODUCT I SHALL I EVER USE."
Galaxy Grand,2,"I JUST RECEIVED THIS MOBILE, ITS A GOOD MOBILE BUT APPLICATIONS ARE NOT MOVING TO SD CARD, COMPANY CLAIMING INTERNAL MEMORY OF 8 GB BUT IT IS JUST 4.04 GB, THIS DEVICE IS NOT COMPATIBLE FOR THE GAME 'SUBWAY SURFERS'"
Galaxy Grand,2,I PURCHASED GRAND ON 4TH FEB.  WHEN I DOWNLOADED SOME APPLICATIONS IT WAS GO SLOW PROCESS. SLIDES ALSO OPEN VERY SLOW AND PROCESSOR IS ALSO MOVING SLOW. RAM WAS SLOW &AMP; NOT SUPPORT ADVANCED  GAMES ITS PLAYING SLOWLY.
Galaxy Grand,2,I THINK SAMSUNG GRAND IS NO BETTER THEN OTHER CHINESE PHONES AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET. WITHIN ONE 03 DAYS AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE IT STARTED HANGING. I IGNORED THE PROBLEM BUT THEN IT STARTED SENDING SECURITY MESSAGES TO THE NUMBER I HAD USED FOR PHONE TRACKING IN CASE OF THEFT WHERE AS THE PHONE WAS IN MY OTHER HAND &AMP; I DID NOT CHANGE THE SIM OR EVER OPENED THE BATTERY COVER. THE WORST IS STILL TO COME AFTER 26 SAYS OF PURCHASE IT TURNS OFF AUTOMATICALLY AFTER GOING INTO SLEEP MODE &AMP; I HAVE TO RESTART IT AGAIN IN ORDER TO WAKE IT UP. MY WORST EXPERIENCE EVERY :(((. PLEASE KEEP AWAY &AMP; GO FOR ANY OTHER MAKE.
Galaxy Grand,2,"I USED SAMSUNG SMARTPHONES FROM PAST TWO YEARS AND THEY LAGS I USED GALAXY ACE AND S3 SALA FUDU PHONE HAI ITNI HANGING PROBLEM.. AND BRO U SAID DONT COMPARE IT WITH MICROMAX I WILL SAY THAT MICROMAX DOING MUCH BETTER THAN SAMSUNG... THEY LAUNCHED THEIR CAVAS HD WITH SAME SPECIFICATIONS AT VERY GOOD PRICE(13999) CANVAS HD HAS FULLY HD DISPLAY,,,,GRAND ITS COST MUCH HIGH(21000) . SO IT IS FOOLISHNESS TO BUY GRAND ND EVER GO TO SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE THEY ALWYAS FULL OF CUSTMERS COMPLAINTS... LOTS OF COMPLAINTS OF LAGING ND HANGING PROBLEMS..AFTER WORST EXPERINCE WITH SAMSUNG NOW I AM USING MICROMAX CANVAS 2 AND I AM PROUD TO B MICROMAX USER. MY FRIENDS REALLY WONDERED TO SEE CNAVAS 2 WHICH IS OF ONLY 10000 WHAT IS SMART BUY CANVAS HD OR GRAND AT THE SAME SPECIFICATIONS..PLS BRO GROW UP ND TRUST ON INDIAN COMPANIES OR RHI BT MICROMAX CHINESE HAI MERE BHAI JB SAMSUNG NE APHONE LAUNCH KRE THE TB USE BHI LOG JAPNESE COMPANY BOLTE MARKET DHIRE DHIRE BNTI EKDM SE KOI NHI BNA PATA NOKIA PHLE TOP PE THA AB USE KOI PUAHTA BHI NHI MICROMAX NE SAMSUNG KI MRKET DOWN KRI TBHI GRAND BS INDIA MEI LAUNCH HUA HAI MMX KO COMPETE KRNE K LIYE..... THE ONLY PLUS POINT IN GRAND IS ITS 8 GB INTERNAL MEMORY REST OF ALL IS BEKAAR.... THUMBS UP TO MICROMAX"
Galaxy Grand,2,"I WENT TO BUY THIS PHONE 5 DAYS BACK. WAS ON THE VERGE OF PAYING FOR A SEALED PIECE TILL I THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD SEE AN OPEN PIECE. SO WENT TO THE NEXT THREE RETAILERS IN THAT AREA. TWO OF THEM HAD DISPLAY PIECES. ALL QUOTED DIFFERENT PRICES RANGING FROM RS 20400 TO 21500. ANYWAY, THE THING TO TELL IS THAT BOTH THE DISPLAY PIECES JUST HUNG WHEN I TRIED THEM OUT. IF THAT IS THE CASE WITH NEW PHONES OF THIS MODEL, I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN LATER. THOUGH I HAVE USED SAMSUNG PHONES EARLIER THIS MODEL HAS BEEN A COMPLETE PUT OFF. INFACT THE RETAILER ALSO TOLD ME TO GO FOR THE HTC DUAL SIM RATHER THAN THE GRAND DUOS. ANYWAYS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS ON THE NET, HAVE DECIDED TO GO FOR AN IPHONE 4 AS THEY ARE THE TOUGHEST WITH THE LEAST PROBLEMS."
Galaxy Grand,2,"I, HAVE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE FACTS ABOUT GRAND AND THEY HAVE JUST SHOCKED ME. PEOPLE ARE NORMALLY EXITED BY THE SCREEN ; BUT THEY DONT KNOW WHT IS BEHIND IT, WHAT SECRETS SAMSUNG IS HIDING. ASK URSELF-&GT;SCREEN OF S3 IS SMALLER THAN GRAND,AND S3 WAS OUT FOR 40K AND GRAND FOR 20K;STILL YOU THINK GRAND IS BETTER,HOW IDOTIC....! GRAND USERS ARE NOW EXPERINCING PROBLEMS. I SUGGEST NOONE SHOULD BUY A GRAND FOR FOLLOWING REASONS:-
      
      
      NEGITIVISM:-
      
      
      FIRSTLY:- GRAND'S ALL OUTTER LAYER OF WHATEVER COLOUR IS MADE OF PLASTIC. SO USERS BEWARE OF CRACKING IN THE PHONE OR DISPLAY BREAK + ITS DUAL SIM, WHICH GIVES A KINDA CHINA LOOK TO THE PHONE! ACTUALLY IT GIVES ME A LAUGH...HOW PEOPLE GET CRAZY AND BUY THE PHONE WHEN THE PRICE IS LOW!
      
      
      1.DISPLAY: WVGA RESOLUTION.A NORMAL XPERIA PHONE WORTH 12K HAS BETTER DISPLAY RESOLUTION(FWVGA) THAN GRAND! DUE TO SUCH RESOLUTION ON LARGE SCREEN THE DISPLAY WONT BE SHARP AT ALL! QUALITY WILL BE DEFINITELY VERY LESS COMPARED TO 2 YEAR OLD S2. GRAND IS NOT AMOLED. IT IS JUST LCD! LCD WILL BE WORST IN BOTH SUNLIGHT AND INDOOR USAGE. NOT WORTH PRICE!
      
      
      2.PROCESSOR: ALL SAMSUNG IS SAYING THIS PHONE HAS 1.2 GHZ DUAL CORE. GRAND HAS BROADCOMM PROCESSOR. THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST PHONE WITH THIS PROCESSOR. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A PHONE WITH BROADCOMM PROCESSOR. PROCESSOR DOESNT MATCH WITH THE SCREEN! BEWARE:MINOR/BASIC APPLICATIONS LIKE GOSMS ETC WILL GIVE A LAG.THE REASON FOR USING THAT PROCESSOR MUST BE CHEAP PRICE. OTHERWISE WHY WOULD SAMSUNG USE OTHER COMPANIES PROCESSOR INSTEAD OF USING ITS OWN PROCESSOR. NOT WORTH PRICE!
      
      
      3. BATTERY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. 2100 MH DRAINS IN 4 HOURS ONLY WITH ABOVE AVERAGE USE IN DOWNLOADING, GAMING, TEXTING. AGAIN A NORMAL XPERIA PHONE HAS 2X TIMES BETTER! A PHONE WORTH 20K MUST HAVE ATLEAST 9HRS BACKUP! NOT WORTH PRICE!
      
      
      4. FLIP COVER IS LOOKS OK BUT NOT A MAGNETIC COVER TO SWITCH OFF / ON THE DISPLAY AUTOMATICALLY WHEN CLOSED / OPEN. NOTHING INTERESTING IN IT!
      
      
      5. PRIMARY CAMERA 8MP - PICTURE QUALITY NOT THAT GREAT (OBJECT AND NOT SUBJECTS AT TIMES IS OUT OF FOCUS), 2MP SECONDARY CAMERA (FRONT) NOT CAPABLE OF HD RECORDING (NOT EVEN AT 720P).NOT WORTH PRICE!
      
      
      6. 8GB INTERNAL MEMORY - DON'T GET ELUDED - OUT OF THE TOTAL DEVICE STORAGE, 4GB IS UTILIZED BY ANDROID OS USERS' HAVE ONLY 4GB (LESS THAN 3.84GB IN PRINCIPLE).SAMSUNG WILL GIVE SOME JUNK DEFAULT USELESS APPLICATIONS, WHICH WILL OCCUPY HALF OF THE PHONE MEMORY. PEOPLE WHO HAVE GRAND CHECK FOR URSELF.
      
      
      7.PLUS - ADDITION TO THIS USERS ARE EXPERIENCING TOUCH PROBLEMS, AUTO TURN OFF, AND A BUZZ SOUND DURING CALL AFTER USAGE OF 9 TO 10 MONTHS !
      
      
      SO... HERE WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION...COMPARED TO THE PRICE GRAND IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE. I GIVE 2 STARS OUT 5 ( MAYBE 2 OUT OF 10) ABOVE POINTS GIVE A FEELING OF A CHINA PHONE ( ITS DUAL SIM) BETTER BUY AN XPERIA  ..IT WILL DEFINETLY SERVE BETTER!"
Galaxy Grand,2,"IF I WILL EXPLAIN ALL THE CONS AND PROS ABOUT THIS SAMSUNG GRAND THAT WILL BE TOO LENGTHY TO READ FOR REVIEW SEEKER THAT'S WHY I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW IN SHORT. THERE IS HANGING PROBLEM IN THIS SET WHEN EXTERNAL MEMORY IS REMOVED IT WORKS FINE SO I THINK I SHOULD USE CLASS 10 MEMORY CARD WHEN I USED CLASS 10 MEMORY CARD  THE PROBLEM DOESN'T RESOLVE, SAMSUNG GRAND WORKS FINE BUT OFTEN HANGS THAT IS VERY IRRITATING IF SUCH KIND OF PROBLEM OCCURS IN 20K SET. I USED SAMSUNG GALAXY S2, SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE, SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB 2 ALL ARE EXCELLENT IF COMPARE WITH SAMSUNG GRAND. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME YOU CAN EXPERIENCE YOURSELF BY SPENDING 20,000 OTHERWISE BEWARE OF SAMSUNG GRAND.
      
      NOTE: I AM NOT SINGLE USER MY OTHER FRIENDS WHO ARE USING SAMSUNG GRAND THEY ALL ARE SUFFERING."
Galaxy Grand,2,"IT HAS ONLY 4 GB INTERNAL MEMORY . BT IN ALL SITES PHONE INTERNAL MEMORY  SHOWS 8 GB .........................................................
      
      WHEN PLAYED GAME LIKE ZYNGA POKER IT SHOWS MEMORY LOW MESAGES................................."
Galaxy Grand,2,"NO COMPLAINS! AS PER THE FLIPKART GOES,  I CAN SAY THAT,  THEY ARE GOING TO CARRY FORWARD THE E-COM IN INDIA AND THE REASON BEHIND THIS CONCLUSION IS THE EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE AND IF THEY REMAIN SO,  I DON'T SEE ANY REASON OF COMPETION IN THE MARKET AND IN NEAR FUTURE PEOPLE MAY STOP GOING TO SHOWROOMS,  IF SUCH SERVICE CONTINUES.
      
      
      ALRIGHT NOW THE PRODUCT, I AM SURE THE PRICE THEY(SAMSUNG) ARE TAKING FOR THIS PRODUCT IS INDEED HIGH AS, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE BRACKET OF 16K TO 18KMAX, IF A PRUDUCT GOES BLANK, HANGS WITHIN 2 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF USAGE/DELIVERY 11/02/2013 THEN, PLEASE DON'T CLAIM IT TO BE A GOOD PRODUCT, I AM SALARIED AND INVESTED A AMOUNT THROUGH WHICH I CUD HAVE PURCHAED A NOTE BOOK(QUALITY OF DELL) A BEST CONFIGURED ASSEMBLED DESKTOP HOWEVER, I WENT FOR IT(GRAND) HOWEVER, I AM INDEED DISSAPOINTED, I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE BY JUST GOING WITH THE BRAND NAME,  I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE REVIEWS FIRST AND THEN THOUGHT OF SINCE, I ALREADY MADE THE SAME(MISTAKE) I WANT OTHERS TO BE VERY CAREFULL
      
      
      ISSUES FACING
      
      
      1.SCREEN GOES BLANK/BLACK AND EVEN THE POWER BUTTON REFUSES TO RESPOND.
      
      2.SCEEN IS HANGED GOING NOWHERE NOT ANY I.E. ANY OF THE THREE BUTTONS DON'T RESPOND
      
      NB: THE PRODUCT COST MORE THEN 26000.00 AFTER SD CARD AND SCREEN GUARD DECISION IS YOUR'S"
Galaxy Grand,2,"PLANNING TO BUY, BUT NOT ANY SOONER.
      
      AS MANY OTHERS REVIEWED I TOO BELIEVE THAT THE PRICE IS LITTLE HIGHER.
      
      
      I BOUGHT LG OPTIMUS 2X FOR JUST 18700/- A YEAR BACK WHILE IT WAS SELLING FOR AROUND 25-27K. NOW THAT MODEL OUT OF MARKET.
      
      
      SIMILARLY, GALAXY S2 WAS SELLING FOR AROUND 32K I THINK 6 MONTHS BACK. NOW IT IS RETAILING FOR JUST BELOW 25K.
      
      
      IF YOU COMPARE S2 WITH GRAND, I THINK GRAND HAS MUCH MORE FEATURES THAN S2 EXCEPT THE DISPLAY RESOLUTION. NOW I'VE A BETTER OPTION OVER S2 I WOULD SAY MY WAIT HAS BEEN REWARDED. IF ANYONE AGREE WITH ME OR NOT VERY SOON I'M EXPECTING A REDUCED VERSION OF NOTE 2. YES, WITH S-PEN AND 5"" DISPLAY (EASY TO CARRY) WITH ALL THE FEATURES AND MORE FOR A MUCH LESSER PRICE OF AROUND 25K. THIS MAY HAPPEN AFTER THE MID OF 2013.
      
      
      MY POINT, WHY SHOULD I JUMP IN WHEN THE PRODUCT IS SO NEW ONLY DEPENDING ON THE TECHNICAL SPECS AND BLOG REVIEWS.
      
      
      AS A REVIEWER SAID, I REQUEST THE NEW BUYERS TO WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW AFTER USING IT FOR 2 OR 3 MONTHS. BECAUSE THAT'S THE REAL TIME WHEN YOU COME TO KNOW COMPLETELY ABOUT YOUR MODEL'S PROS &AMP; CONS."

Galaxy Grand,2,"THE PHONE IS GOOD EXCEPT FOR THE BATTERY. I HAVE DUAL SIMS IN THE PHONE AND A FEW IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS LIKE SWIFTKEY, Y-MAIL,FACEBOOK ETC. ALWAYS RUNNING.

AND  IT DISCHARGES REALLY FAST, ESPECIALLY IF THE BATTERY LEVEL IS BELOW 30%. WORKS OUT TO

Galaxy Grand,2,"THEIR ADS SAYS SAMARTPHONE EXPERIANCE REDEFINED AND I FELT LIKE SAMSUNG TRYING TO FOOL ME AND TO SEE IT . REDEFINED IN WHAT WAY.IT IS WVGA ON A 5-INCHER 480X800 WITH 187PPI PIXEL WONT GIVE YOU AN HD EXPERIENCE. CHEAPER PHONES LIKE LUMIA 620 GIVES BETTER DISPLAY AT CHEAPER PRICE.
      
      PROCESSOR IS ANOTHER MINUS POINT IN THIS PHONE.AN UNKNOWN 1.2 GHZ DUAL CORE WHILE ITS COMPITITORS (ALMOST ALL OF THEM FROM MOTOROLA TO NOKIA INC HTC AND LG) HAVE SUPER PROCESSORS LIKE KRAIT ,CORTEX,S4 ETC.
      
      BUYING THIS PHONES WOULD MAKE SENSE ONLY IF YOU ARE KEEN ON BUYING A 5 INCH PHONE.I DONT KNOW WHY ANY BODY WOULD SACRIFICE THE OVERALL SMARTPHONE EXPERIENCES JUST TO HAVE BIG SCREEN SIZE WITH SUBSTANDARD VIEWING QUALITY.
      
      IF YOU UP YOUR BUDGET YOU CAN BUY 4.3 INCH LUMIA 820 OR MOTOROLA RAZR XT910 OR EVEN HTC DESIRE V.

Galaxy Grand,1,"FRIENDS, I AM TRULY WRITING MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE. SAMSUNG IS JUST CHEATING THE BY RELEASING THESE KIND OF WORST QUALITY EXPENSIVE MOBILES. I BOUGHT THIS ONE IN EMI, REALLY FEELING BAD THAT I HAD MADE A WRONG DECISION.
      
      
      AS AN ONLINE FRIEND AM SUGGESTING YOU, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS MOBILE. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE LUCKY THEY MAY NOT BE FACING ANY ISSUE. IF YOU ARE THE ONE LIKE ME. THEN YOU WILL FEEL THE SAME.  I NEED TO RESTART MY MOBILE MINIMUM OF 5 TIMES A DAY.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      1) DISPLAY IS WASTE - GALAXY S2 HAS MUCH BETTER DISPLAY THAN THIS.
      
      2) SOUND QUALITY IS QUITE NORMAL.
      
      3) MOBILE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHED OFF, SOME TIMES.
      
      4) DURING CALL THE MOBILE WILL AUTOMATICALLY DISCONNECT YOUR CALL.
      
      5) OUT OF 8 GB INTERNAL MEMORY ALWAYS 3.8 GB IS FILLED WITH DEFAULT APPLICATIONS.
      
      6) I AM USING LG OPTIMUS P500 BEFORE, THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS IN DURABILITY.
      
      7) THE PRICE IS DAMM EXPENSIVE, IT BETTER TO GO FOR NOKIA, KARBONN, MICROMAX IN 10,000
      
      YOU WILL GET ALL THE FEATURES.
      
      8)  MY PHONE DISPLAY WILL AUTOMATICALLY GO OFF AND SOME BUZZZZ KIND OF SOUND IS
      
      COMING FROM THE SPEAKER.
      
      9) YOU CANNOT MOVE YOUR APPLICATIONS TO EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD.
      
      10) BATTERY LIFE IS JUST AVERAGE
      
      11) SAMSUNG WILL GIVE SOME JUNK DEFAULT USELESS APPLICATIONS, WHICH WILL OCCUPY HALF OF THE PHONE MEMORY.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1) 5 INCH DISPLAY
      
      2) DUAL SIM
      
      3) GAMING

Galaxy Grand,1,"HEY GUYS
      
      
      I  BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 15TH FEB , SO THIS IS MY THIRD  DAY AND I`M  WRITING THIS REVIEW TO VENT MY ANGER AND FRUSTRATION.
      
      SO FAR I`M NOT HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE. SERIOUSLY I`M FED UP WITH SAMSUNG PRODUCTS.. THEY ARE CHEAP WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER PRODUCTS. TATS THE ONLY THING MOST OF US CONSIDERS IT BEFORE BUYING THIS CRAP. I EXCHANGED MY BEAUTIFUL,ELEGANT NOKIA C7 FOR 5K TO BUY THIS BIG SLATE.( USED MY NOKIA C7 FOR WHOOPING 750 HOURS TALK TIME)  I HAVEN`T EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT MOBILE, BUT THIS GRAND IS NOT A GRENADE FOR OTHER MOBILES .
      
      HERE I DON`T WANT TO EXPLAIN ABOUT THE PROS &AMP; CONS.. BUT BEFORE BUYING THIS JUST REMEMBER THESE...
      
      
      ***MOBILE FREEZES UP FREQUENTLY. SO FAR 8 TIMES
      
      ***BATTERY LIFE POOR - 6 TO 7.5 HRS  WITH POWER SAVING ENABLED MODE.

Galaxy Grand,1,"HEY GUYS...IT IS THE CRAPPIEST PHONE OF SAMSUNG. I BOUGHT IT ON THE BASED REVIEW OF IGYAAN..BUT AFTER THE USAGE OF 10-12 DAYS..I AM NOW DISAPPOINTED  AT THE SCREEN CLARITY OF THIS PHONE...BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE I WAS SURE THAT WVGA RESOLUTION ON 5 INCH PHONE WILL BE AVERAGE..BUT WILL BE MANAGEABLE..BUT NOW I REALLY REGRETTING MY DECISION OF BUYING THIS.
      
      ALSO PLAYING GAMES ON THIS PHONE IS A PUNISHMENT .DONT KNOW ABOUT ITS GPU..NOR ITS PROCESSOR BRAND..I PLAYED 4-5 GAMES AND IT STARTS LAGGING AND RESTARTING AGAIN AND AGAIN

Galaxy Grand,1,"HI DEAR ALL,

      SO PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. WAIT FOR THE NEW ONE. CHEERS FRIENDS."
Galaxy Grand,1,"HI,
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR A WEEK NOW. LOTS OF CONS, SOME PROS.
      
      CONS:
      
      HANGS. A LOT. AND CANNOT BE RESET THEN WITH POWER KEY...YOU HAVE TO PULL OUT THE COVER AND REMOVE THE BATTERY. BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO DO THIS ONLY ONCE IN A DAY. IF YOU ARE LUCKY, THIS MAY NOT HAPPEN IN AN ENTIRE DAY. IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY, YOUR PHONE MAY NOT RECEIVE CALLS FOR SEVERAL HOURS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW IT HAD HANGED IN YOUR POCKET. THIS DID NOT IMPROVE EVEN AFTER I DID THE LATEST FIRMWARE UPDATE USING KIES.
      
      
      CORPORATE EMAIL SYNCING PROBLEM: THIS I HAVE REALISED IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH SAMSUNG HANDSETS. EMAIL DOESN'T SYNC WELL. SOMETIMES IT SYNCS ONLY WHEN YOU HIT THE SYNC KEY MANUALLY, THOUGH YOU HAVE SET IT TO AUTO SYNC. SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T UPDATE FOR 3 OR 4 HOURS; SOMETIMES A FEW EMAILS NEVER COME (THOUGH THIS IS RARE)
      
      
      SCREEN: THIS IS NOT A DISAPPOINTMENT--ITS A GOOD SCREEN, BUT FEELS A BIT BAD IF YOU REALIZE THAT MICROMAX A110 HAS THE EXACT SAME SCREEN--YOU WANT SOMETHING A BIT BETTER AT THIS PRICE. BUT IS GOOD BY ITSELF, IF NONE OF YOUR FRIENDS HAS A MICROMAX A110 CANVAS2 (NO, ITS NOT COMPARABLE TO A116--ITS TOUCH AND FEEL AND PERFORMANCE IS LIKE THE A110, WHICH A CLOSE RELATIVE IS USING AND HAS NO PROBLEMS WITH)
      
      
      DATA NETWORK DOESN'T GET CONNECTED MANY TIMES, AND OTHER SAMSUNG PHONES TOO SEEM TO FACE THIS ISSUE. THOUGH THIS IS NOT AS SERIOUS AS EMAIL SYNC. MY OFFICE IT SUPPORT SAID THIS ISSUE CROPS UP MANY TIMES, BUT IT HAS NEVER COME ON A NON-SAMSUNG PHONE.
      
      
      ALARM DOESN'T RING SOMETIMES--SOME NOTIFICATIONS IN THE MORNING SHOWUP ONLY WHEN THE PHONE ALARM RINGS, EG. SOME WHAT'SAPP NOTIFICATIONS OR LOW BATTERY NOTIFICATIONS, CAUSING THE ALARM TO JUST STOP IN 2-3 SECONDS, THUS CAUSING YOU TO SLEEP. SIMPLE SOLUTION IS TO SET TWO ALARMS EACH MORNING. YOU WON'T FORGET TO DO THIS THE FIRST TIME YOU GET LATE FOR OFFICE DUE TO THIS BUG. SAW ANOTHER USER ON A FORUM FACING THE SAME ALARM PROBLEM. ALARM IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR ME, SO HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. IF YOU CAN'T DEPEND ON AN ALARM, ITS AS GOOD AS NOT THERE.
      
      
      FACED THIS THREE TIMES ON THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF USE: CALL COMES IN, BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ANYTHING. BUT HASN'T HAPPENED FOR PAST FEW DAYS; MAY HAVE BEEN FIXED BY THE FIRMWARE UPDATE, THOUGH I THINK IT HAPPENED ONCE EVEN AFTER THE UPDATE
      
      
      THIS ONE IS THE LEAST OF A CON--SCREEN IS OVERSENSITIVE, CAUSING THE DELETE BUTTON (ONSCREEN) TO BE PRESSED WHEN YOU TRY TO USE THE 'BACK' BUTTON AT PHONE LOWER RIGHT CORNER (IN THE ACTIVESYNC EMAIL APP).
      
      
      ANOTHER ONE: THE WALLPAPER DOES NOT MOVE LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN YOU MOVE THE HOMESCREENS. THIS HAPPENS FOR ALL CHEAPER NON-SAMSUNG PHONES, SO NO REASON WHY SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN BY SAMSUNG, ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS UI IS WHAT PEOPLE LOOK TO
      
      
      ALSO, SAMSUNG DISABLES YOUR ABILITY TO MOVE APPS TO SD CARD. BUT THIS APPLIES TO ALL SAMSUNG PHONES (S3, S4, NOTE II). ALL YOU CAN USE IS THE INTERNAL MEMORY. MANY HAVE A DOUBT ABOUT HOW MUCH THE GRAND HAS. WELL, IT HAS AROUND 3.9GB AVAILABLE TO THE USER, SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER SOMEONE SAYS IT 4GB OR 8GB. YOU GET THE FULL 3.9 GB.
      
      
      SCREEN FADES OUT WHILE READING, AND THEN AGAIN BECOMES FINE IN A FEW SECONDS. THE 'EYES' DETECTING FEATURE KEEPS THE SCREEN ON MOST TIMES (BUT FADES IN BETWEEN AS MENTIONED), BUT DISAPPOINTS SOMETIMES, ESPECIALLY IN LOW LIGHT, OR SOMETIMES IF YOU ARE WEARING SPECS
      
      
      PROS:
      
      LOOKS GOOD, LIKE A HIGH-END PHONE
      
      IS NOW AVAILABLE AT 18.2K IF YOU USE THE MONEY-BACK -EMI OFFER (ON STD CHARTERED AND ICICI BAND CREDIT CARDS)
      
      SMOOTH OPERATION. OUT OF BOX, I FELT IT LAGGED A BIT, BUT SINCE THEN, SOMEHOW I AM IMPRESSED BY SMOOTHNESS OF OPERATION. YOU WILL LOVE THE PHONE'S FEEL.
      
      HANGS ONLY ONCE IN A DAY. ONCE YOU GET USED TO REMOVING ITS COVER AND BATTERY, ITS A CHILD'S PLAY TO DO ONLY 30 TIMES A MONTH (HANGING IS NOT SPECIFIC TO CERTAIN UNITS--JUST DO A GOOGLE SEARCH FOR 'GALAXY GRAND HANGING PROBLEM' AND SEE HOW MANY RESULTS YOU GET)
      
      
      BOUGHT THIS THOUGH ON A TIGHT BUDGET, SINCE I HAD READ MICROMAX IS BAD IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY TO HAVE A FAULTY HANDSET, SINCE THEY HAVE BAD SERVICE. SAMSUNG HARDWARE IS GOOD, AND THIS ONE IS NO EXCEPTION. THE SOFTWARE ISSUE (HANGING, ETC) IS POINTED OUT SO COMMONLY ONLINE THAT SAMSUNG WILL EVENTUALLY ATTEMPT TO FIX IT IN THE NEXT FIRMWARE (UNLESS THEY AREN'T ABLE TO, OR THEIR SUPPORT TEAMS MOVE ON TO FOCUS ON THE NEWER MODELS).
      
      
      PLEASE RATE THIS REVIEW HIGHLY IF YOU FEEL IT IS USEFUL, SO THAT OTHERS MAY BENEFIT FROM IT. I FEEL NO ONE SHOULD FEEL THE PAIN THAT I FELT AFTER STRETCHING MY WALLET MORE THAN I COULD, ONLY TO GET RELIABILITY OF SAMSUNG OVER MICROMAX. NOW I THINK IT WASN'T WORTH IT...WILL BE BLESSED IF OTHERS ARE SAVED SOME PAIN."
Galaxy Grand,1,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT TO NOT BUY THIS PHONE AS I AM THE VICTIM.
      
      
      POINTS TO NOTE BEFORE PURCHASE:
      
      BATTERY BACKUP - TOO WORST
      
      DUAL SIM - WORKS ONLY FOR VODAFONE AND TATA DOCOMO AND NOT FOR OTHER NETWORKS
      
      SCREEN RESOLUTION IS NOT UPTO THE LEVEL.
      
      3G HAVE SOME ISSUES TO ACTIVATE"

Galaxy Grand,1,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR PAST 1 MONTH.WHEN WE KEEP ON DOING ANY APPLICATION CONTINEOUSLY SAY PLAYING GAMES, OR CHECKING EMAILS, SCREEN IS GETTING BLANK FOR A SECOND AND THEN THE BRIGHTNESS IS GETTING CHANGED.
      
      
      I VISITED THE SERVICE CENTER THEY DONT HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THIS.THEY FORMATTED MY PHONE AND INSTALLED SOME BINARY SOFTWARE STILL I AM FACING THE ISSUE.THEY TOLD ME I WILL GET A CALL FROM SAMSUNG.EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE OWN SERVICE CENTER THEY DONT HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THIS.THEY GAVE ALL BULL SHIT ANSWERS STILL MY PROBLEM NOT SOLVED.
      
      
      IT IS DEFINITELY FOR THE HARD WARE PROBLEM.AS HE UPDATED THE SOFTWARE AND I FACED THE SAME ISSUE.
      
      
      I SUGGEST NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT."
Galaxy Grand,1,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE, INITIALLY THE MOBILE IS SLOW SLIGHTLY EVEN I DIDN'T INSTALL EVEN AN SINGLE APPLICATION, AFTER TWO DAYS I LOADED THE APPLICATION WITH SOME INTERNET BASED APPLICATIONS SUCH AS FACEBOOK, GOCHAT, TRUE CALLER AND SOME MORE APPLICATION. AFTER THIS MOBILE IS HANGING FREQUENTLY AND I AM RESTARTING THE APPLICATION BY TAKING TO &AMP; FRO THE MOBILE BATTERY, ITS VERY FRUSTRATION AND LOSS OF MY MONEY 19.5K. I DONT KNOW HOW THESE PPL ARE RATING THIS PHONE UP TO 5 STARS.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THE INTERNET/WIFI 24/7 DONT BUY THIS MOBILE AT ANY COST EVEN ITS FREE, THIS PHONE WILL BE SUITABLE ONLY FOR THE PPL WHO WONT USE THE INTERNET MUCH. IT IS A CRAP FROM SAMSUNG."
Galaxy Grand,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM SPICE HOTSPOT ON MAY 10, 2013. EVERYTHING WENT RIGHT UNTILL A WEEK WHEN MY PHONE STARTED TO BEHAVE IN WIRED WAY. THE TOUCH SCREEN OF MY MOBILE PRESS ITSELF RANDOMLY ACROSS THE SURFACE WHICH CAUSE MY MOBILE TO OPEN APPLICATIONS AND DO WHATEVER IT CAN BY PRESSING ITSELF ALL OVER IT. APPLICATIONS RANDOMLY OPENS, MESSAGES ITSELF SENT DUE TO RANDOM CLICKS. IT FEEL LIKE BEING POSSESSED. EARLIER I ATTRIBUTED THIS PROBLEM TO ANY VIRUS BUT I CONTINUED TO FACE THIS EVEN AFTER MASTER RESET OF MY MOBILE. I WROTE TO SAMSUNG AND REQUESTED THEM TO REPLACE THE MOBILE BUT THEY DENIED AND DIRECTED TO TAKE THIS TO SERVICE CENTER.
      
      THINGS WENT WORSE WHEN MY FRIEND WHO PURCHASED THIS MOBILE BEGIN TO FACE THE SAME ISSUE AFTER FEW DAYS. NOW I HAVE NOWAY LEFT BUT TO TAKE MY NEW MOBILE PURCHASED AFTER PAYING OUT LARGE MONEY, TO SERVICE CENTER.  I WISH I HAD PURCHASED IT THROUGH FLIPKART SO THAT I COULD REGISTER THE COMPLAINT AND MY MOBILE WOULD HAVE REPLACED TILL NOW. I REALLY REGRET TO BUY IT FROM SPICE HOTSPOT."
Galaxy Grand,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 23RD APRIL WITH A ICICI CREDIT CARD WITH 12 MONTH EMI BUT THE TRANSACTION DINT CONVERT TO EMI. SO BEWARE, ITS BETTER TO BUY FROM A STORE FOR EMI TRANSACTIONS.
      
      
      PHONE REVIEW :
      
      1) NICE TOUCH RESPONSE
      
      2) YOU DONT MISS THE AMOLED SCREEN IF YOU DO SOME TWEAKS WITH FONTS AND SETTINGS, THE DISPLAY LOOKS GOOD
      
      3) BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD"
Galaxy Grand,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE WITH A GREAT TRUST ON THE BRAND SAMSUNG.  I AM FACING TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS 1. IT WILL THE LOOSE THE CONNECTIVITY ON ITS OWN AND YOU WILL NOT REALIZE IT TOO. YOU WILL ONLY GET TO KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE A CALL, THEN YOU WILL GET MESSAGE, PHONE NUMBER IS NOT REGISTERED. NEED TO RESTART THE PHONE TO RESUME CONNECTIVITY. 2. YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU PHONE IS IN A SWITCHED OFF CONDITION ON ITS OWN. YOU WILL ONLY GET TO KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE CALLS. MINOR PROBLEM. SOME TIMES CAMERA WILL NOT RESPOND. YOU WILL GET MESSAGE AS CAMERA WILL NOT RESPOND.
      
      
      HAD NEVER EXPECTED THAT, THIS GRAND WILL HAVE  SCREWSUPS RELATED TO BASING MOBILE FUNCTION LIKE CONNECTIVITY.  THAT IS WHY, I RENAMED AS ""SAMSUNG GAND"""
Galaxy Grand,1,"I BYED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART. I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS DEVICE. THE SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT GOOD. IT DOES NOT HAVE AN HD DISPLAY INSTEAD IT HAS ONLY A WVGA DISPLAY. IT IS A DUEL CORE PHONE. SAMSUNG IS NOT TELLING ABOUT ITS PROCESSOR. ITS PRICE IS VERY HIGH FOR THE SPECIFICATIONS. SO I SOLD THIS SHIT PHONE AND BOUGHT THE NEW AWESOME MICROMAX CANVAS HD A116 SUPERFONE. CANVAS HD IS AWESOME. IT HAS AN HD DISPLAY. IT HAS A QUADCORE MEDIATEK 1.2GHZ PROCESSOR. IT SUPPORTS HD VIDEO RECORDING. BROWSING THE NET IS VERY NICE. IT HAS A 1 GB RAM. I LIKED ITS DESIGN. I LOVE THIS PHONE VERY MUCH. THE PRICE IS VERY LOW FOR ITS SPECIFICATION. MOREOVER I AM PROUD TO BUY AN INDIAN PHONE.
      
      SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND IS A WORST BAD UGLY PHONE. ONLY SUCKERS WILL BUY THIS SHIT."
Galaxy Grand,1,"I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, ALTHOUGH I AM A SAMSUNG FAN. I RECENTLY BOUGHT S3 MINI, WHICH, ALTHOUGH AT SAME PRICE, IS BETTER THAN THIS MOBILE.
      
      
      LET ME TELL YOU THE REASONS FOR WHICH I DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOBILE, AFTER I CHECKED A DEMO PIECE AT UNIVERCELL SHOP:
      
      
      1) THE WORST THING IN THIS PHONE IS DISPLAY, I DON'T KNOW WHY SAMSUNG DESIGNED THIS MUCH LOW PIXEL DENSITY FOR 5"" DISPLAY.
      
      
      2) THE TOUCH SUCKS, YOU CAN FIND MAJOR DIFFERENCE HERE IN COMPARISON WITH S-AMOLED SCREEN.
      
      
      3) 2100 MAH BATTERY IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS DISPLAY SIZE, AT LEAST 3000 MAH WAS NEEDED.
      
      
      ONLY GOOD THINGS IN THIS MOBILE IS 8 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA AND DUAL SIM.
      
      
      CONCLUSION:
      
      
      I RECOMMEND S3 INSTEAD OF THIS PHONE, IF YOU ARE READY TO SPEND 6-7 K MORE."
Galaxy Grand,1,"I HAVE PURCHASED MY PHONE SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND DUOS FROM FLIPKART SITE UNDER AN OFFER OF 15% CASHBACK AND 0 % INTEREST ON EMI'S.
      
      I PURCHASED THE PHONE IN APRIL,2013.
      
      BUT NOT YET RECEIVED THE CASHBACK AMOUNT, AND WHEN EVER I CONTACT FLIPKART THEY GIVE ME A NEW DATE FOR CASHBACK.
      
      
      I DIDN'T EXPECTED THIS CHEATING FROM A COMPANY LIKE FLIPKART.
      
      IT HAS BEEN 2 MONTH SINCE I AM FOLLOWING THESE GUYS BUT NO SUCCESS YET."
Galaxy Grand,1,"I HAVE USED THIS PHONE 3-4 DAYS. I THINK IT IS SURELY OVERPRICED PHONE. BATTERY BACKUP IS ALSO NOT SO GOOD DUE TO LCD SCREEN. IF THERE WILL BE AMOLED SCREEN, THE BACKUP MAY BE BETTER. THE PHONE ALSO HAS A DRAWBACK I.E. LOWER PPI ONLY 187 PPI. THE OPTIMUM VALUE FOR HUMAN EYE IS 180 PPI; IT IS JUST STRIKING THE BAUNDRY LINE IN THAT CASE. THE SCREEN IS NOT CLEAR BLACK. BLACK ARE NOT DEEP BLACK, IT IS SOME KIND OF GREYISH TONE, WHICH IS ACTUALLY DRAINS BATTERY FASTER. THE LIGHT SENSOR IN THIS PHONE IS JUST GAVE FOR NAME. IT IS NOT WORKING WELL AS NOKIA OR SONY PHONES. THE OTHER DRAWBACK IS SAMSUNG IS NOT GIVING CORNING GORILLA GLASS SCREEN IN THIS PHONE. SO CHANCES OF SCRATCHES ARE COMMON IN THE SCREEN. THE MAIN DRAWBACK IS WHEN THE PHONE DROPS, YOUR SCREEN GET BROKEN. OTHER COMPANIES ARE GIVING GORILLA GLASS SCREEN IN 15000 RANGE.  THE SCREEN FLUCTUATES IN ANDROID GAMING BENCHMARK. THE MEMORY CARD IS ONLY REMOVABLE WHEN U SWITCH OFF THE PHONE AND REMOVE THE BATTERY. GO FOR GALAXY S ADVANCE, IF YOU ARE NOT CONSIDERING FOR DUAL SIM. IT HAS MUCH BETTER SCREEN, MUCH BETTER GAMING GRAPHICS, CLEAR BLACK DISPLAY, GOOD BATTERY BACKUP AND LESS PRICE. IN THIS RANGE U CAN GET SOME OTHER HANDSETS, EVEN IN LOWER RANGE I.E. LUMIA 620, LUMIA 800, XPERIA SOLA, WHICH IS HAVING MALI 400 GPU AND PRICE IS ONLY 14500, XPERIA GO WHICH IS AVAILABLE ALSO AT SAME PRICE AND HAVING SAME GPU AND IS DUST AND WATER RESISTANT, XPERIA P, WHICH IS 0F 20990 IS HAVING 540*960 PIXEL RESOLUTION IN 4 INCH SCREEN AND HAVING BRAVIA ENGINE AND MALI 400 GPU, HTC-8S IS ALSO A GOOD PHONE.

Galaxy Grand,1,"I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS COMPANY. FEW MOTHS BACK THEY LAUNCHED SO BIG BIG BIG ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE MARKET WITH NOTE2 AND S3. NOW ANOTHER SHORT BUZZ GRAND.
      
      
      THIS PHONE HAS ALMOST A TOUCH F EVERYTHING OF SAMSUNG'S TOP LINE PHONES. MY POINT IS THEN WHAT SHOULD BE THE REASON FOR A BUYER TO BUY A TOP LINE PHONE WHERE THIS COMPANY PLAYING WITH THE EXCLUSIVITY OF THOSE PRODUCTS? TOP OF THAT ITS A DUAL SIM PHONE. I DON'T THINK THIS COMPANY IS LISTENING TO ITS CONSUMERS. TILL THE DATE WHATEVER DUAL SIM PHONE THIS COMPANY MANUFACTURED IT WAS A FAILURE. NOW WHAT'S NEW? ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE THAT? IT SURELY DOESN'T SEEMED TO ME FROM SPECS THEY MENTIONED.
      
      
      ITS GOING TO BE A BIG CONFUSION FOR THOSE CONSUMERS WHO WERE PLANING TO PUT THEIR EXTRA BUCKS ON S3. IT LOOKS DITTO SAME. IN TERMS OF THE RESOLUTION THEY COMPROMISED. I THINK ITS ALL ABOUT DISPLAY FOR THIS COMPANY. IF THEY OFFER A GOOD RESOLUTION ITS GONNA PINCH YOUR POCKET. I AM JUST SPEECHLESS. PLAYING DISPLAY GAME. NOT THE PHONE. SAME OLD PLASTICY FEEL. TECHNICALLY THEY ARE REDUCING THE BOUNDARY OF MID RANGE AND TOP LINE PHONES. I"
Galaxy Grand,1,"I KNOW THE REPUTATION OF SAMSUNG BUT THE PRICE IS REALLY HIGH COMPARING TO MICROMAX A116 CANVAS HD.
      
      
      THE PRICE OF A116 WILL BE UNDER 15,000.
      
      
      JUST SEE THE SPECS AND IT IS GOING TO BE RELEASED TOMMOROW ON VALENTINES DAY.
      
      
      IF YOU HAVE GUTS .... GO FOR IT..."
Galaxy Grand,1,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A SMARTPHONE AT 20K RANGE FOR MY FRIEND, AND SHORTLISTED SAMSUNG GRAND DUOS AND SONY XPERIA ION. I FOUND OUT THAT XPERIA ION IS MUCH BETTER THEN GRAND DUOS THOUGH AT SAME PRICE.
      
      
      ION IS A 4G PHONE WHILE GRAND DUOS IS 3G.
      
      
      ION HAS 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SCORPION, DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, WHILE DUOS HAS 1.2 GHZ UNKNOWN BROADCOMM PROCESSOR. BOTH HAVE 1 GB RAM.
      
      
      ION HAS 4.6 INCH HD 720 X 1280 PIXELS WITH 323 PPI DENSITY WHILE GRAND DUOS HAS 5 INCH 480 X 800 PIXELS WITH JUST 187 PIXEL DENSITY. GRAND DUOS DOES NOT HAVE SUPER AMOLED SCREEN, AND DISPLAY QUALITY IS FAR LESS THEN XPERIA SERIES PHONES. WHATS THE USE OF BIGGER SCREEN WITH LOWER QUALITY?
      
      
      ION HAS 12 MP CAMERA VS 8 MP GRAND DUOS HAVE. FURTHER, SONY CAMERAS ARE FAR SUPERIOR THEN SAMSUNG. EVEN IPHONE AND NOKIA USE SONY CAMERA LENSES.
      
      
      ION IS ALSO UPGRADABLE TO ANDROID 4.1.
      
      
      ION HAS INTERNAL MEMORY OF 16 GB (12 GB FOR USER) VS 8 GB (4 GB FOR USER) IN GRAND DUOS. FURTHER, U CANNOT TRANSFER APPLICATIONS TO SD CARD IN SAMSUNG, WHILE U CAN IN SONY.
      
      
      ION HAS HDMI PORT WHICH GRAND DUOS DOES NOT HAVE.
      
      
      THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN BATTERY SIZE.
      
      
      BUILD QUALITY OF SONY PHONES ARE ALWAYS SUPERIOR THEN SAMSUNG PHONES. NO EXCEPTION HERE.
      
      
      SO IN ALL MAJOR FACTORS, ION OUTPERFORMS GRAND DUOS BY GRAND MARGIN. IN FACT ION OUTPERFORMS SAMSUNG S2 AND ONLY S3 IS COMPARABLE WITH ION (THOUGH S3 ON HIGHER SIDE).
      
      
      FINALLY I WOULD SUGGEST, DONT BUY JUST BECAUSE YOUR FRIEND HAS BOUGHT. COMPARE PHONES, CHECK YOURSELF AND THEN TAKE DECISION."
Galaxy Grand,1,"I WONT SUGGEST ANYONE TO GO FOR THIS PHONE . IT LOOKS GOOD AND A 5INCH SCREEN BUT QUALITY WISE VERY CHEAP. IT HANGS A LOT . IF DUAL SIM NOT MANDATORY THAN IN THIS RANGE NOKIA LUMIA 820 IS BEST .

Galaxy Grand,1,SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND AND SAMSUNG CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT WORTH FOR 21K. SERVICE IS POOREST AMONG ALL THE BRANDS OUT THERE.

      THE ANDROIDS USE 100'S OF COMPLETELY HOPELESS &AMP; USELESS APPLICATIONS WHICH NEED MORE &AMP;  MORE POWER TO KEEP UP WITH WINDOWS PHONE. EVEN DOUBLE THE POWER OF A WINDOW'S PHONE ON AN ANDROID IS NOT ENOUGH TO RUN THE PHONE AS SMOOTHLY AS AN WINDOWS PHONE.

      ANDROIDS ARE USING MORE POWER TO KEEP UP WITH WINDOWS AND HAS TO KEEP THEIR PRICE AT SKY AND STILL NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE SMOOTHNESS OF A WINDOW'S PHONE.
      
      
      SO WHY WE ARE SPENDING ON SUCH A PHONE??? ONLY TO GET ACCESS TO SOME USELESS APPS WHICH ARE NEVER HELPFUL EITHER (LAUGHING CAT, LOVE METER, ASTROLOGY). HAVE SOMETHING IN YOUR HEAD, NOT ON YOUR HEAD.
      
      
      SO WHICH ONE YOU WILL PICK??? A BUS OR A AUDI??? THE CHOICE IS YOURS....."
Galaxy Grand,1,THIS PHONE IS JUST THE DUMMIER VERSION OF THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3. ALL THE FEATURES HAVE BEEN COPIED BY COMPROMISING ON THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT. A SHEER WASTE OF MONEY .PUT AN ADDITIONAL 16K AND YOU WOULD GET THE DECENT SAMSUNG S3 OR NOTE 2. THE PHONE IS HANGED EACH TIME I PLAY A GAME OR OPEN MORE THAN 2 APPLICATION. I THINK SAMSUNG PEOPLE SHOULD STOP CHEATING THE USERS BY LURING THEM INTO DUMB PHONES LIKE THIS AND FLIPKART SHOULDNT BE SELLING THEM.
Galaxy Grand,1,"VERY BAD PHONE ,

Galaxy Note,5,"AM USING THIS MOBILE FROM PAST 1 MONTH AND ITS BEEN GREAT EXPERIENCE.
      
      BEST THINGS ARE SCREEN 5.5 INC, BEST SOUND, BATTERY REALLLY AWESOME IT GIVES FOR 2 DAYS WITH USAGE OF GAMES, INTERNET, MUSIC AND CALL .
      
      SPEED IS AWESOME ITS LIKE A CAKE , GOOD LOOK WITH AWESOME FEATURES WHICH WE CANNOT EXCEPTED FROM A MOBILE LIKE MOTION, TAP FOR CONTACTS, VOICE COMMAND FOR CALLING, MUSIC , CAMERA, AND ALARM.
      
      MULTIPLE WINDOWS, MULTIPLE TASK AT THE SAME TIME, THIS ALL MAKE A COMPLETE PACKAGE OF MOBILE AND TABLEET TOGETHER.
      
      I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO GOR FOR IT AND I DONT THINK ANY OTHER MOBILE WILL COME IN FUTURE AS SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2. 5STARS....GREAT PHONE. VERY HAPPPYYY.."
Galaxy Note,5,"AMAZING PHONE! BRILLIANT AND VIBRANT DISPLAY! EVEN MORE AMAZING IS THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE INTERFACE AND THE SOUND OUTPUT. LIKE SAMSUNG PORTRAYED IN THE IFA UNVEILING OF THIS PHONE, THE S PEN REALLY DOES TURN INTO A ""MAGIC WAND"" WHEN IT COMES TO THIS DEVICE. THE BROWSING SPEED IS REALLY GOOD. SAMSUNG'S S VOICE SUCKS AND WAS A DUPLICATION OF EFFORT SINCE GOOGLE VOICE IS FLAWLESS. JELLY BEAN REALLY DOES TAKE ANDROID INTO A NEW DIMENSION. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Galaxy Note,5,"APART FROM SOME EXCELLENT TECH SPECS, HERE ARE SOME GREAT &AMP; UNIQUE FEATURES OF THIS PHABLET:
      
      
      S PEN:
      
      IT HAS GOT THE MOST ADVANCED STYLUS WHICH BECOMES HANDY IN VIEWING VIDEOS &AMP; CHECKING MAILS (AIRVIEW) AND ALSO EDITING IMAGES.
      
      
      PAPER ARTST:
      
      IT IS MY FAVOURITE PHOTO EDITING APP AND IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ANDROID MARKET. APART FROM GALAXY NOTE 2, ONLY NEW GALAXY CAMERA HAS THIS FEATURE.
      
      
      ALLSHARE PLAY (DLNA):
      
      WITH JUST A PRESS OF A BUTTON, I CAN RUN THE MEDIA FROM MY PHONE ON ANY OTHER SMART DEVICE REQUIRING ONLY A WIFI CONNECTION.
      
      
      TEXTING BECOMES VERY EASY &AMP; FAST WITH ITS ADVANCED CLIPBOARD MEMORY WHICH AUTOMATICALLY RECOMMENDS FREQUENTLY USED WORDS IN SEQUENCE."
Galaxy Note,5,"BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE I WAS USING S3 .I WILL BE WRITING REVIEW OF NOTE 2 IN COMPARISSION TO S3 . I WAS NOT SURE WHETHER TO BUY NOTE 2 OR CONTINUE USING S3 .I READ LOT OF REVIEWS ON YOUTUBE , CHECKED PHONES AT MOBILE SHOW ROOMS AND FINALLY DECIDED TO BUY NOTE 2 .
      
      I TELL U , THIS IS BEST PHONE WITH BEST FEATURES .ITS PROCESSOR IS MUCH FASTER THAN S3 . CAMERA QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD . BATTERY BACK UP IS EXCELLENT . ON PAPER ITS PPI IS LESS THAN S3 AND MANY OTHER PHONES , BUT IN REALITY THE SCREEN QUALITY IS EXCELLENT . SAMSUNG HAS USED RGB TECHNOLOGY WITH GREAT CARE WHICH MAKES SCREEN LOOK MORE CLEAR AND VIBRANT .
      
      ONLY THING WHICH GOES AGAINST NOTE 2 IS ITS SIZE . BUT I TELL U ONCE U START USING , AFTER 2-3 DAYS U WILL NOT FIND THIS PHONE BIG . AND ANY PHONE WHICH IS BIGGER THAN 4"" , CANNOT BE USED WITH ONE HAND . U HAVE TO USE BOTH HANDS .
      
      BUY THIS PHONE , U WILL DEFINITELY ENJOY ."
Galaxy Note,5,"BEST BUY IN THIS PRICE RANGE. FORGET SIII, HTCS, XPERIAS.
      
      USING THIS PHONE IS AN 'EXPERIENCE'. IF THERE'S ANY CELL WHICH HAS A CLASS AND STANDS OUT IN THE CROWD AFTER IPHONES, ITS GOT TO BE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE II."
Galaxy Note,5,"BOUGHT THE BEAST LAST WEEK, BUT NOT FROM FLIPKART, THOUGH I THOT ABOUT WRITING A REVIEW.
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS FOR THE MAXIMUM ENTERTAINMENT AND U WONT FIND ANY LAGGING OR SLOWNESS IN DOING THE SAME.
      
      
      ALSO, THIS PHONE IS WORTH FOR THE PRICE AND TR TO EXPERIENCE THE FEELING OF A NOTE 2 OWNER ;)"
Galaxy Note,5,"EXCELLENT DELIVERY PROCESS.IT HAS BEEN A DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE TO PURCHASE FROM FLIPKART.
      
      AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT FROM SAMSUNG- THOUGH IT SEEMS AN EXPENSIVE GIZMO AT FIRST VIEW.
      
      MY BAGGAGES TO WORKPLACE HAD INCLUDED MY NETBOOK IN THE PAST, WITH CABLES, A WIRELESS MODEM, USB DEVICES,ETC. AND IT SEEMED A BURDEN TO CARRY TWO BAGS.
      
      MY TARGET WAS TO PURCHASE A DEVICE WHICH COULD ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR A NETBOOK.
      
      A TABLET SEEMED A WORTHY DEVICE- BUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH HCL ME LEFT A HOLE IN MY POCKET AND A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF A CUMBERSOME DEVICE, HEAVY ON THE WRISTS.
      
      1. NOT MEANT FOR A PHONE.
      
      2. EXCELLENT PHABLET FOR BROWSING,MAIL, ELIMINATES USE FOR KEYBOARD FOR TYPING"
Galaxy Note,5,"EXCELLENT PHONE. REAL LONG BATTERY LIFE. BATTERY COMES DOWN FROM 100% TO 30% AFTER A FULL DAY'S USE OF 3G, WI-FI, MUSIC/VIDEO AND CALLING. MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIG FOR PEOPLE WITH AVERAGE SIZED HANDS.
      
      ONLY NEGATIVE POINT IS THAT THERE IS NO OTG CABLE IN THE BOX."
Galaxy Note,5,"FINALLY A PRODUCT TO LOOK FORWARD TO, BE IT ENTERTAINMENT, BUSINESS OR CREATIVE NEEDS. A POWERHOUSE DEVICE. WELL IF YOU CAN AFFORD ANYTHING, THIS IS THE ONLY PHONE YOU NEED TO BUY.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1] 5.5 INCH SUPER HD AMOLED SCREEN.
      
      2] ERGONOMICAL DESIGN FOR EASY HANDLING (YOU CAN USE THIS PHONE EVEN WITH 1 HAND)
      
      3] S PEN - AND IT'S FUNCTIONALITIES - ( THERE ARE SO MANY SHORTCUTS TO NUMBER OF FUNCTIONALITIES, YOU WON'T NEED HOME, BACK BUTTONS)
      
      4] SMOOTH UI
      
      5] WHOPPING 2GB OF RAM &AMP; 16GB INBUILT MEMORY ( YOU CAN USE 10.75 GB ONLY OUT OF THIS, BUT I HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THAT ).
      
      6] 3100 MAH BATTERY - WORKS FOR ALMOST 1.5 DAYS FOR ME.
      
      7] GREAT, RATHER I WOULD SAY ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITIES THAN SIII (IN IT OWN DOMAIN)
      
      8] BEST FOR BUSINESS PURPOSE AS WELL AS ENTERTAINMENT, MULTIFUNCTIONAL USAGE.
      
      9] GREAT CAMERA QUALITY
      
      10] FINALLY, GREAT USER EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1] THIS PHONE NEEDS A MICRO-SIM, BEWARE OF HAVING IT BEFOREHAND.
      
      2] ""TOP OF THE PYRAMID"" PRICE.
      
      3] NEED TO HAVE A COVER AND SCREEN GUARD IMMEDIATELY - YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE SCRATCHES ON YOUR NOTE II'S SCREEN RIGHT ?
      
      
      OVERALL I WOULD SAY THIS IS THE BEST PHONE EVER.
      
      WORTH THE PRICE TAG.
      
      
      GO FOR IT! YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT. THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR TIMELY DELIVERY AS COMMITTED.
      
      THANKS TO PENNYFUL CASHBACK FOR EFFECTIVELY REDUCING THE PRICE TAG."
Galaxy Note,5,"FIRST FLIPKART IS REALLY AWESOME AND I GOT MY PRODUCT IN 3 DAYS....
      
      NOW THIS PHONE -
      
      
      KEY FEATURES IS AVAILABLE IN DESCRIPTION HERE IS MY REVIEW AFTER USING IT ....
      
      
      THIS IS ONE HELL OF A GADGET,ITS THE BEST AVAILABLE ANDROID PHONE IN MARKET RIGHT NOW..
      
      SCREEN - THE SCREEN IS AMAZING. EVEN WITH LESS PIXELS AND A BIGGER SCREEN,THE SHARPNESS IS MUCH HIGHER.ITS JUST SO EYE POPPING TO LOOK AT EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT THE RAW HD SCREEN OF THE GALAXY NOTE II. ITS HARD TO LOOK AWAY FOR EVEN A MOMENT. AND GUESS WHAT? ITS NOT PEN-TILE!IT DECODES DVIX AND XVID MOVIES SO WATCHING ON THIS SCREEN IS A BLAST WITH HD...
      
      
      BATTERY - AS WELL AS DESC. THE DEVICE IS RUN ON A MAMMOTH 3100 MAH LI-ION BATTERY FOR OPTIMUM BATTERY LIFE.ITS LASTED ME FOR AROUND FOR 20 HOURS AFTER HARD USE LIKE PLAYING HD GAMES,INTERNET BROWSING,PLAYING SOME HD VIDEOS WID FULL BRIGHTNESS ON...
      
      
      DESIGN AND FEEL - YES ITS A BIG PHONE/TABLET BUT REALLY IT FEELS NICE IN THE HAND. I KNOW THE DEVICE IS PLASTIC BUT IT SOME HOW HAVE A PREMIUM FEEL TO IT. IT IS VERY UNCANNY BUT ITS BEAUTIFUL AND LOOKS BETTER THEN THE WHITE VERSION IMO(I HAVE A GREY ONE).PEOPLE WHO SEE MY PHONE THEY SAID ITS VERY BEUTIFUL PHONE,BIG ONE BUT VERY NICE.
      
      
      S PEN - THIS S PEN FEELS QUITE BETTER. IT'S BIGGER AND MORE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD AND MUCH MORE PRECISE/PRESSURE SENSITIVE. IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO A WHOLE LOAD OF NEW THINGS. QUICK PEN GESTURES ARE GREAT. YOU DRAW A CUSTOM FIGURE TO TRIGGER ONE ACTION (TOGGLE WIFI OR BLUETOOTH, LOOK UP SOMETHING IN THE WEB, CALL/TEXT). TAKING MEMOS, PARTIAL SCREENSHOTS, SCRIBBLING HAS ALL BECOME MORE ENJOYABLE AND ACCURATE.
      
      
      CAMERA - TAKES GREAT PICTURES UP TO 8 MP AND THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN ON A SAMSUNG MOBILE DEVICE, THE PICTURES ARE JUST SO COLORFUL. THE PICTURES SNAPS FAST AND I LOVE IT, IF YOU HOLD THE CAMERA BUTTON DOWN IT SNAPS UP TO 20 PHOTOS IN A SECOND (?) AND IT HAS PANORAMA WHICH I ENJOY USING.
      
      
      OTHER THINGS - IT HAS 1.6 GHZ QUAD CORE CORTEX-A9 PROCESSOR AND 2 GB RAM SO IT IS MUCH MUCH FASTER THEN ANY OTHER ANDROID PHONE RIGHT NOW,IT COMES WID JELLY BEAN WHICH IS SMOOTHEST AND VERY GOOD LOOKING ANDROID VERSION YET SO HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE MAKES THIS PHONE INCREDIBLE.ITS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF APPS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN THAT YOU CAN USE MULTI-VIEW WITH BUT HERE IS THE LIST:
      
      
      CHROME (ONCE INSTALLED)
      
      CHATON
      
      EMAIL
      
      GALLERY
      
      GMAIL
      
      INTERNET
      
      MAPS
      
      SNOTE
      
      MESSAGING
      
      YOU-TUBE
      
      VIDEO PLAYER
      
      GOOGLE TALK
      
      
      AND NOW CONS - ITS HAVE SOME CONS LIKE CURRENTLY -
      
      THERE IS NO ANY APP IN GOOGLE PLAY FOR THIS PHONE TO MOVE APPLICATION AND APPDATA TO EXTERNAL SD CARD COZ SAMSUNG CHANGE HIS DATA MANAGE SYSTEM ON GALAXY S3 AND NOTE 2,SO 16 GB VERSION IS NOT FULFILL MY REQ. COZ ONLY 11 GB OUT OF 16 GB AVAIL. FOR USE ON THIS PHONE AND BIG HD GAMES TAKES UP TO 1 GB OF SPACE...ONLY 1 WAY TO MOVE APPS TO SD CARD IN CURRENTLY IS ROOTING THIS PHONE BUT IT WILL RUIN ITS WARRANTY......SO WAIT FOR A NEW APP
      
      
      IT WOULD BE GREAT IF ALL APPS COULD RUN UNDER MULTI-WINDOWS MODE BCOZ SEVERAL APPS IS CURRENTLY WE USE IN MULTI WINDOW FEATURE.
      
      
      AT LAST I LOVE THIS PHONE AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I DON'T SEE MYSELF USING ANOTHER PHONE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.IT'S AN AWESOME PHONE.AS LONG AS HAVING TO USE TWO HANDS SOMETIMES DOESN'T BOTHER YOU, GET IT.
      
      GRAB IT ASAP...."
Galaxy Note,5,"FIRST OF ALL IT'S A UNTHINKABLE PERFORMER IN ITS CLASS .NO SMART PHONE COMES CLOSE WITH ITS PERFORMANCE ..WITH ITS 5.5 SCREEN

      THE CAMERA QUALITY IS UP TO THE MARK NOT SO EXCEPTIONAL BUT PRETTY DECENT WHEN IT COMES TO SAMSUNG PHONES
      
      RELATED TO SOME SAYING THAT IT'S A PRETTY BIG PHONE FUZZ ... GUYS IT'S ALL ON INDIVIDUAL VISION . PERSONALLY I HAVE BEEN USING  FOR 2 WEEKS AND I AM ALMOST USED TO IT .. IT FEELS NORMAL TO ME GRIP IS PERFECT FOR ME AND IT FITS IN MY HAND PERFECTLY NO PROBLEM WHILE TYPING OR ANY OPERATION AND  IF SOME HAS SMALL HAND SAMSUNG HAS TAKEN CARE OF WITH ITS ONE HANDED OPERATION FEATURES .
      
      -COMING TO BATTERY ..THIS IS WHERE NO ONES CAN TOUCH THIS BEAST .. IT'S 3100 MAH PROBABLY 2ND HIGHEST  BATTERY IN THE SMART PHONE CATEGORY ..IT LASTS FOR 28 TO 30 HOURS FOR ME WITH VERY EASE AND IF I USE LESS IT LASTS ABOUT 2 DAYS

      -INTERNAL PROVIDED AFTER THE PARTITION BY OS IS AROUND 11 GB  WHICH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO INSTALL YOUR APPS AND GAMES
      
      -SUPER AMOLED HD SCREENS ADDS CHERRY TO ITS PERFORMANCE .. WATCHING VIDEO IN THIS 1080 P IS A EVER LASTING FUN
      
      GUYS IF U HAVE THIS MUCH MONEY TO BUY THIS PHONE JUST DONT THINK TWICE JUST GO FOR IT  ..
      
      IF NOT THAN DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS AWESOME PHONE ..IT HAS EVERY LITTLE BIT TO COMPLETE  YOUR DAILY AS WELL AS YOUR TEDIOUS TASK
      
      AND LASTLY  MANY THANKS TO FLIPKART  SERVICES DELIVERED THE PRODUCT BEFORE THE EXPECTED DATE WITH PROPER PACKING ... THUMBS UP FOR FLIPKART AND ITS SERVICE"
Galaxy Note,5,"FIRST OF ALL THIS IS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T EVEN OWN A SINGLE SMARTPHONE AND THEY GIVE NEGATIVE REVIEW TO THE JUGGERNAUTS OF THEIR FIELD SUCH AS APPLE IPHONE , SAMSUNG S4  AND NOTE 2 ... YOU GUYS SERIOUSLY NEED TO GO AWAY .. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW A PHONE WITHOUT USING IT :/
      
      NOW AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED WITH THE REVIEW OF THIS PHONE IT CAN BE DESCRIBED IN ONE WORD ONLY ...AWESOME
      
      I USED TO OWN LG OPTIMUS BLACK P970 BEFORE THIS PIECE OF ART SO THIS IS MY SECOND ANDROID PHONE. I WANTED TO CHANGE MY CELL SO AFTER MONTHS OF MIND TUMBLING RESEARCH ON NET I WAS SERIOUSLY CONFUSED BETWEEN IPHONE 5 AND NOTE 2 I WANTED TO GO FOR IPHONE 5 BUT I DIDN'T WENT FOR IT AS I WAS IN THE NEED OF A PHONE WITH BIG SCREEN SO I MADE THE FINAL VERDICT AND WENT FOR NOTE 2 THOUGH IT WAS RELEASED 9 MONTHS AGO BUT IT SPECS AND PERFORMANCE CAN BEAT ANY PHONE IN THE MARKET TODAY ... AND THIS GAMBLE WORKED PERFECTLY FOR ME AND I'M IN LOVE WITH IT
      
      NOW EVERY ONE KNOWS ABOUT THE SPECS SO I WOULD'T DISCUSS IT HERE ...  AND MOST OF THE SMARTPHONE OWNER KNOW THIS FACT THAT SPECS ON THE PAPER REALLY DOESN'T MATTER IT'S ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE OS AND UI THAT REALLY MAKES A SMARTPHONE
      
      1) NOW I'VE SEEN PEOPLE SAYING THAT IT'S TOO BIG TO BE USED IN DAILY LIFE... I WANT TO ASK THOSE PEOPLE HAVE YOU EVER HOLD THIS PHONE IN YOU HAND ??? IT'S JUST PERFECT AFTER SPENDING 30-40 K ON A SMARTPHONE YOU DON'T DESERVE A SMALL SCREEN .. YOU DESERVE A LARGER CRISP 720P SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY IN WHICH YOU CAN WATCH MOVIES AND OTHER  STUFF THAT YOU DO ON YOUR LAPPY OR PC.
      
      2) NOW ABOUT THE BATTERY ""BIG SCREEN MEANS MORE BATTERY WHICH MEANS LESS BACK UP"" THESE WERE THE WORDS OF MY FRIEND, I NEVER BUY ANY ELECTRONIC WITHOUT HIS APPROVAL AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I LISTEN TO MY MIND AND I'M PROUD OF MY DECISION NOTE 2 HAS THE BEST BATTERY BACK UP AMONG ALL THE SMARTPHONES PRESENT IN THE MARKET TODAY DESPITE HAVING LARGER DISPLAY IT GIVES ME 1-2 DAYS BACK UP ON WI-FI
      
      3) NOW ABOUT THE BUILD QUALITY I REALLY ADMIT THAT NOTE 2 CAN'T BE COMPARED WITH IPHONE AND HTC ONE IN BUILD QUALITY BUT BELIEVE YOU ON ME PEOPLE IT IS NOT CHEAP PLASTIC AS RUMOURED BY PEOPLE IT'S MADE UP OF  GOOD POLY CARBONATE.
      
      4) OVERALL AS YOU MUST HAVE READ IN THE OTHER REVIEW THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE IS GREAT THERE IS NO LAG IN IT I GOT 4.1.2 OUT OF THE BOX AND 4.2 IS READY FOR THE RELEASE IN AUGUST THEN IT WILL HAVE MOST OF THE S4 FEATURES.
      
      5) WHEN I BOUGHT THIS I USED TO THINK THAT THIS S PEN I WOULD'T EVER GOING TO USE BUT NOW I ACTUALLY USE THIS S PEN FOR MOST OF THE OPERATION OF THE PHONE AND WORDS JUST CAN'T DESCRIBE IT . YOU GOTTA USE BY YOURSELF
      
      6) THE STOCK ACCESSORIES IS OF GOOD QUALITY EXCEPT THE EAR PHONES THEY ARE JUST HORRIBLE ZERO BASS .. I OWN PREMIUM HEADPHONES SO IT NOT A BIG DEAL FOR ME BUT CONSIDER THIS YOU HAVE TO BUY NEW EAR/HEAD PHONES IF YOU WANT GOOD MUSIC EXPERIENCE BUT LET ME CLEAR I'M NOT SAYING THAT ONLY NOTE 2 HAS BAD EARPHONES MOST OF THE STOCK EARPHONE ARE OF BAD QUALITY
      
      7) LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST I READ IN A REVIEW ON FLIPKART THAT ""DON'T FALL FOR SMARTPHONE TACTICS YOU CAN BUY A.C FRIDGE OR A CAR ON EMI ""NO OFFENSE TO THAT BUT PREMIUM RANGE SMARTPHONE ARE NOT MADE FOR COMMON PEOPLE WHY MISGUIDE PEOPLE, BUY A PHONE THAT YOUR BUDGET ALLOWS. BUT DON'T CURSE IPHONE, NOTE 2 FOR THEIR HIGH PRICE
      
      AND PLEASE DON'T COMPARE THESE PHONES WITH LAVA,XOLO,KARBONN,CELKON ETC.
      
      
      
      NOTE 2 IS A BENCHMARK IN SMARTPHONE INDUSTRY JUST GO FOR IT"
Galaxy Note,5,"FIRST OF ALL THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE AND I AM LUCKY I CHOSE THIS ONE.
      
      
      I WAS VERY MUCH CONFUSED WHETHER TO GO FOR S3 OR NOTE 2. MANY PEOPLE COMMENTED THAT NOTE IS BIGGER AND NOT EASY TO HANDLE. BUT TRUST ME IT IS NOT THAT BIG AND EASILY FITS INTO MY POCKETS. AND THE BEST PART OF IT IS THE FEATURES IT PROVIDES WHEN YOU COMPARE WITH S3 LIKE S-PEN ALONG WITH AIRVIEW WHICH IS TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL WHILE BROWSING WEB. ALSO THIS SCREEN IS BEST FOR WATCHING MOVIES AND READING E-BOOKS.FINALLY THE HUGE BATTERY STANDS FOR ME ATLEAST 3 DAYS WITH MINIMAL USAGE."
Galaxy Note,5,"FLIPKART HOW DO YOU ALWAYS SATISFY ME WITH YOUR SERVICE?
      
      ORDERED THE PRODUCT ON FRIDAY AND RECEIVED IT ON MONDAY..
      
      ONLY FLIPKART CAN PULL IT OUT..PACKING WAS A LIL SLUGGISH STILL I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THE BEAST INSIDE.
      
      
      NOW FOR THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1.MASSIVE SCREEN  WITH FEATHER TOUCH SENSITIVITY.  GOT THE LATEST UPDATE OF JELLY BEAN TOO.
      
      2.THERE'S ENOUGH MEMORY INSIDE TO ACCOMODATE A HOUSE. FLIPKART PROVIDES US WITH AN ADDITIONAL 16GB MEMORY CARD TO TOP THE ICING.
      
      3.PROCESSOR SPEED AND RAM ARE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO RUN GAMES LIKE MAX PAYNE AND TEMPLE RUN.
      
      4.BATTERY BACK IS PRETTY GOOD. .IN FACT THE BEST..GETD ME EASI THROUGH OUT THE DAY WITH HEAVY USAGE.
      
      5.CAMERA IS NOT THE BEST.. STILL WILL GET YOU THE PICTURE YOU WANT.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. YOU WILL NOTICE THE MOBILE AND THE CHARGER WILL HEAT UP DURING CHARGING AND WILL REMAIN LIKE THAT TILL THE CHARGE REACHES AT 80% THEN IT WILL COOL DOWN.
      
      
      THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE FACED.
      
      
      ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FLIPKART AND SAMSUNG FOR MAKING LIFE EASY FOR ME."

Galaxy Note,5,"I AM USING MY NOTE 2 FROM LAST 19 DAYS IT'S A REAL BEAST .BEFORE THIS NOTE 2 I USED MANY SMART PHONES BUT THIS IS GIVING ME A WHOLE NEW EXPERIENCE. I'M LOVING IT.
      
      FIRST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BIG BUT AFTER GETTING HANDS ON IT FEEL'S SMALL.IT EASILY FITS IN MY POCKET.
      
      
      I BOUGHT I FROM FLIPKART IT,S AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE SHOPPING WITH THEM FLIPKART IS THE MOST TRUSTED SITE IT IS NO.1 IN INDIA.IT'S SERVICE IS TOO GOOD."
Galaxy Note,5,"I AM USING THE DEVICE FOR LAST 20 DAYS AND MY EXPERIENCE IS VERY GOOD, IT IS VALUE FOR MONEY.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE NOT A HARDCORE IFAN THEN THIS PHONE IS BEST.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      SCREEN SIZE
      
      HANDLING (IT MAY LOOK AWKWARD TO HANDLE INITIALLY BUT AFTER 4-5 DAYS IT IS JUST A NORMAL SIZE GADGET)
      
      PROCESSOR SPEED AND RAM (TILL NOW NO GLITCHES)
      
      GOOD CAMERA
      
      RUNNING 2 APPS ON SAME SCREEN.
      
      DETACHABLE BATTERY (YOU NEED NOT TO VISIT SERVICE CENTER TO REPLACE BATTERY)
      
      EXPANDABLE MEMORY
      
      AND MANY MORE PROS.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      I DINT FIND ANY CONS BUT IF YOU PURCHASE A DEVICE FOR ITS LOOK AND FEEL THEN ITS PLASTIC BODY MAY BE A DOWN FOR YOU. IF YOU WANT TO PURCHASE A DEVICE FOR ITS PERFORMANCE  THIS IS THE BEST YOU CAN GET AT THIS PRICE.
      
      
      FOR SAMSUNG VS IDEVICE
      
      IDEVICE HAS RETINA DISPLAY AND PREMIUM ALUMINIUM + GLASS BODY. EXCEPT THAT NOTE II HAS UPPER HAND ON ALL THE AREAS."
Galaxy Note,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE SINCE LAST 4 MONTHS NOW, AND ITS AMAZING, NOTHING COMPARED TO ITS SPEED AND QUALITY. I SPECIALLY LOVE ITS SCREEN SIZE, HD QUALITY AND PROCESSOR SPEED. MORE OVER WITH JELLY BEAN UPDATE OF 4.2.2 RELEASING SOON IN INDIA FOR NOTE 2 ITS EQUIVALENT TO GALAXY S4 IN TECH TERMS. IT HAS BEAUTIFUL S PEN FEATURE AND I WILL STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SMARTPHONES ABOVE 30K."
Galaxy Note,5,"I BOUGHT MY GALAXY NOTE II AROUND SEVEN MONTHS BACK AND STILL I'M LUVING IT. AWESOME PHONE TO USE AND HAVE FUN WITH.
      
      
      I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO IS PLANNING TO BUY PHONE ABOVE 30K RANGE.
      
      
      GO FOR IT.... :)"
Galaxy Note,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT ON 2ND FEB 2013, AND I'M WRITING THIS REVIEW BASED ONLY ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF 1 WEEK OF USAGE, AND NOT BASED ON ITS SPECIFICATIONS ON PAPER.
      
      
      FIRST UP, THE THING THAT IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS, HOW BEAUTIFUL THE DISPLAY IS - ITS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! FULL HD VIDEOS &AMP; HIGH DEF IMAGES LOOK GREAT ON IT!
      
      
      THE  CAMERA IS ALSO REALLY GOOD. I MEAN, I'M NOT COMPARING IT WITH ANYTHING (READ, IPHONE 5, LUMIA 920, ETC); ALL I'M SAYING IS, ONE CAN'T BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE NOTE 2 FOR ITS CAMERA. BESIDES, I FOUND THAT LOW LIGHT PHOTOS ARE ALSO VERY GOOD (AGAIN, NOT COMPARING WITH ANYTHING); THEY ARE MORE THAN SATISFACTORILY DETAILED ENOUGH, FOR ME AT LEAST - MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN THE 5 MP SHOOTER ON MY PREVIOUS PHONE (MOTOROLA DEFY).
      
      
      THE PHONE HAS NO LAG. BE IT BROWSING, GAMING, OR SIMPLY DOING THE BASIC FUNCTIONS - NONE OF THEM SHOWED ANY SIGN OF LAG.
      
      
      AN IMPORTANT POINT TO NOTE HERE: A FRIEND OF MINE HAS A GALAXY SIII, AND AFTER HE INSTALLED THE JELLY BEAN UPDATE 4.1.1, HIS PHONE WAS LAGGY. I MEAN, HE COMPLAINED ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME, AND I CHECKED THAT OUT PERSONALLY - THAT PHONE JUST LAGGED IN JUST ABOUT ANYTHING, SOMETIMES LESS, SOMETIMES FOR LONGER DURATIONS. WHEN YOU HELD IT IN YOUR HAND, IT DIDN'T APPEAR THAT THIS PHONE HAS A QUAD CORE CPU INSIDE! IN FACT, HE TOLD ME THAT HE RESTARTS THE PHONE EVERY MORNING, COZ OTHERWISE THE LAGGYNESS BECOMES JUST TOO MUCH TO BARE. I SIMPLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT - I MEAN, AFTER ALL, JELLY BEAN IS SUPPOSED TO ABOLISH LAG, ISN'T IT? AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT THE TECH GURUS SAY. NOW, ONE FINE DAY, HE CALL ME UP &AMP; TELLS ME, ALL EXCITED, THAT HE GOT THE JELLY BEAN 4.1.2 UPDATE ON HIS PHONE THAT DAY, AND HE INSTALLED IT, AND THE LAG HAS JUST VANISHED! HE SAYS HE DOESN'T RESTART HIS PHONE ANYMORE.
      
      
      MY NOTE 2 CAME INSTALLED WITH JELLY BEAN 4.1.2 OUT OF THE BOX. BUT, IF ANYBODY IS FACING ISSUES WITH THE NOTE 2 (OR, WITH THE GALAXY S3 ALSO, FOR THAT MATTER), DO CHECK IF YOUR PHONE IS RUNNING 4.1.1 OR 4.1.2 - APPARENTLY, IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE (IT DID WITH MY FRIEND AT LEAST).
      
      
      LASTLY, I'M GONNA SAY TO PEOPLE CONSIDERING THIS PHONE, OR PEOPLE WHO ARE CONFUSED WITH WHAT PHONE TO BUY IF THEY HAVE A BUDGET UPWARDS OF 30K, SEE WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE. THE QUESTIONS YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF ARE, DO I NEED A BIG PHONE (AND THEREBY A BIG SCREEN) THAT ALLOWS ME TO BROWSE PAGES WITHOUT ZOOMING IN (MOST OF THE TIME), OR DO I NEED A MORE POCKETABLE PHONE? DO I NEED A DEVICE WHICH GIVES FLAWLESS PERFORMANCE &AMP; ADDED FUNCTIONALITIES OVER OTHER PHONES (READ, S PEN), OR DO I NEED A LIGHTER PHONE WHICH IS MORE SUITED FOR ONE HAND OPERATION? THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER QUESTIONS YOU CAN FORM, BUT I'M SURE YOU GET THE IDEA. I KNEW WHAT I WANTED, I RESEARCHED FOR A MONTH, I GOT THIS PHONE, AND I AM HAPPY. AS LAST THOUGHTS, JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE, THIS IS THE MOST HIGH END (1.6 GHZ QUAD CORE EXYNOS CPU, 2 GB RAM), AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE ANDROID DEVICE IN THE MARKET... CHEERS! :)"
Galaxy Note,5,"I GOT THIS FROM FLIPKART JUST ABOUT A WEEK AGO. AS USUAL THE DELIVERY WAS ON TIME (ACTUALLY BEFORE TIME) SO NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FLIPKART.
      
      NOW ON THE PHONE
      
      IT HAS GOT EVERYTHING YOU CAN GET IN A PHONE
      
      
      PROS
      
      AN AMAZING WIDESCREEN 5.55"" SCREEN (HD SUPER AMOLED)
      
      1.6 GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR WITH 2 GB RAM (SO FAST)
      
      ANDROID 4.1 JELLYBEAN
      
      S PEN WITH AWESOME FEATURES LIKE AIRVIEW ( DEFIES LAWS OF PHYSICS!!!)
      
      HAS GOT CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2
      
      BATTERY IS AMAZING (FAST CHARGE, BEST BACKUP)
      
      S VOICE IS RESPONSIVE
      
      AN IMPRESSIVE CAMERA WITH ALL FEATURES, FRONT CAMERA IS ALSO VERY GOOD
      
      I CAN'T WRITE ALL PROS 'CAUSE THEY ARE SO MANY!!!!!!!
      
      
      CONS
      
      THE ONLY CON I CAN FIND IS THAT IT'S SO FAST (JUST KIDDING!!!)
      
      
      IT IS A MUST MUST BUY MUCH BETTER THAN APPLE (I WAS USING APPLE BEFORE THIS)
      
      IN LESS PRICE"
Galaxy Note,5,"I GOT THIS PHONE DELIVERED IN TWO DAYS AFTER PLACING THE ORDER. HAPPY TO SEE THE NEAT PACKAGING. I MAY NOT BE SATISFIED TO THIS LEVEL, EVEN IF I GO AND BUY IN SAMSUNG STORE FOR THIS PRICE. SUCH A PERFECT COMPANY SEALED BOX AND NEW STOCK!!
      
      
      GREAT TO SHOP WITH YOU... KEEP UP THE SAME
      
      
      IN COMBO DEAL, THE COVER WHICH I GOT FROM SAMSUNG (EFC-1J9FWEGINU) FOR 1K IS NOT WORTH?THE LOOKS AND QUALITY OF COVER IS JUST AVERAGE.
      
      
      THE SIZE OF PHONE IS BIT HUGE AND QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE TO HOLD/CARRY EVERY TIME ? APART FROM THAT PERFORMANCE IS GOOD, RUNS ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. SCREEN DISPLAY (SUPER AMOLED) IS ALSO TOO GOOD AND IT?S A PLEASURE TO WATCH HD VIDEOS AND MOVIES.  JUST NOTE THAT IT NEEDS MICRO SIM"
Galaxy Note,5,"I HAVE A SMARTPHONE FROM BLACKBERRY/NOKIA/APPLE/SAMSUNG/HTC AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DISSATISFIED WITH ONE THING OR ANOTHER. AFTER WAITING (WITH EVENTUAL DISAPPOINTMENT) FOR THE IPHONE 5 LAUNCH, I FINALLY DECIDED TO GO FOR NOTE 2.
      
      
      AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT MY SEARCH FOR A GOOD SMARTPHONE HAS FINALLY COME TO AN END... AND I'M GOING TO LIST ONLY THE PRO'S
      
      1. BIG SCREEN - PERFECT FOR WATCHING MOVIES ON LONG FLIGHTS. YOU DON'T NEED A TAB ANYMORE.
      
      2. BIG BATTERY - I HAVE MORE THAN 3-4 HOURS OF VOICE CALLING EVERYDAY + CONSTANT DATA BROWSING, ETC ETC - I STILL END UP WITH &GT;40% BATTERY BY NIGHT.
      
      3. PEN - VERY HELPFUL FOR MAKING LITTLE NOTES"
Galaxy Note,5,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF SAMSUNG PHONES SINCE DAYS WHEN C 100 WAS AS POPULAR AS THE NOTE LINEUP. I ALWAYS KNEW THEY HAD SOMETHING IN THEIR DISPLAY THAT SETS THEM APART AND NOW THE WORLD ACKNOWLEDGES IT. I HAVE RODE THE NOTE PATH BEFORE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF USING NOTE 1 WAS SOMETHING RATHER REVOLUTIONARY AND THAT COMPELLED ME TO GO FOR NOTE 2. NOTE 2 UNLIKE THE PREDECESSOR IS NOT IN UNCHARTERED WATERS AND ENJOYS THE PREMIUM OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE DEVICE FOR WHICH THE TERM PHABLET WAS COINED AND LIVES UPTO IT.
      
      THE 2ND EDITION PHABLET IS BY NO MEANS RESTRICTED AND USES THE FULL PROWESS OF THE QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AND THE 2 GIGS OF TEAM. MANY OUT THERE MIGHT ALSO BE NOT AWARE THAT IT HAS A DEDICATED QUAD CORE GRAPHICS PROCESSOR (MALI 400 MP) AS WELL AND IT MAKES SPLENDID USE OF IT. I FELT THE NEED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW AT THIS POINT BECAUSE RECENTLY I NOTICED PEOPLE GETTING CONFUSED BETWEEN MEGA 6.3 AND NOTE 2 AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASSERT THAT PREFERRING NOTE 2 OVER MEGA 6.3 SHOULD BE A NO BRAINER. MEGA IS NO WHERE CLOSE TO WHAT NOTE 2 OFFERS. THE SAMOLED HD DISPLAY ITSELF SHOULD SEAL THE DEAL.I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER SEVEN MONTHS NOW AND BELIEVE ME I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT HESITATE. THROW AT IT WHATEVER YOU CAN THINK OF AND IT HANDLES IT BETTER THAN WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT. AT A POINT OUT OF CURIOSITY I RAN 80 APPS IN PARALLEL AND IT NEVER BOTHERED FOR A HICK UP AND ISN'T THAT THE TRUE PURPOSE OF SMARTPHONE. FOR MEDIA CONSUMPTION YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT BIG PLASMA TV OR SHOULD YOU PREFER THE MEGA. THE S PEN ON NOTE 2 KEEPS GETTING BETTER WITH EVERY FIRMWARE UPDATE AND NOW IT LITERALLY RECOGNISES THE UGLIEST OF MY SCRIBBLINGS. THE JB 4.2.2 IS ON ITS WAY AND THEN IT CAN DEFINITELY BE MATCHED TO S4 IN TERMS OF ALL THE EYE CANDY IT OFFERS. ONE MORE THING YOU WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT THE TITANIUM GREY COLOR OPTION IS LIMITED TO NOTE2 AND THAT MAKES IT LOOK EXCLUSIVE. IT GIVES THE PHABLET A CLINCH? OF ITS OWN AND A SOPHISTICATED LOOK. I AM SURE TO USE THIS DEVICE ATLEAST TILL NOTE 3/4 PUSHES SOME REVOLUTIONARY BOUNDARIES.REVIEW WRITTEN FROM S PEN ITSELF"
Galaxy Note,5,"I HAVE NOT BOUGHT THIS FROM FROM FK BUT IM WRITING JUST TO SHARE ..MY 1MONTH EXPERIENCE WITH THIS AMAZING PHONE..
      
      
      +'S
      
      
      USB CONNECTOR---- U CAN CONNECT ANY PEN DRIVE (I HAVE TRIED UP TO 32GB)AND IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM ...
      
      
      USB MOUSE--- IT SUPPORTS ANY USB MOUSE AND WHEN U CONNECT IT A POINTER SHOWS UP ON SCREEN . YOU CAN USE ALL THE FEATURES LIKE LEFT CLICK RIGHT CLICK AND SCROLL ... THATS A GREAT EASE OF USE.
      
      
      SCREEN SIZE------ IS BIG ENOUGH BUT FITS IN POCKET EASILY, AND I HAVEN'T FACED ANY PROBLEM USING IT WITH ONE HAND AS U CAN MANAGE UI ACCORDING TO YOUR USAGE IE LEFT HANDED OR RIGHT HANDED.
      
      BATTERY------ AMAZINGLY IT LAST ONE DAY EASILY WITH CONTINUOUS 3G DATA AND CALLING UP TO 6-8 HOURS A DAY.
      
      
      TAP AND SHARE ---- U CAN TAP 2 PHONE BACK TO BACK AND SHARE WHAT SO EVER IS ON YOUR SCREEN LIKE PICTURES AND VIDEOS..
      
      (I HAVE TRIED TAP SHARE WITH NOTE 2 AND S3 )
      
      
      TV CONNECTOR ------- ALSO AMAZING ... JUST CONNECT IT TO ANY HD TV AND GET AMAZED... U CAN VIEW VIDEOS AND PICS... AND PLAYING GAMES IS JUST A GREAT EXPERIENCE ..(YOU LL HAVE TO BUY TV CONNECTOR SEPARATELY )..
      
      
      WELL FOR NOW I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS MUCH WITH MY NOTE 2 ..
      
      AS A CONCLUSION I LL SAY IF U HAVE UR POCKETS LOADED AND WILLING TO SPEND THEN DONT THINK MUCH JUST GO FOR IT..."
Galaxy Note,5,"I HEARD THE SPECIFICATION IS GOOD AND FAR BETTER BUT HOW ABOUT THE THEFT SECURITY? PLIZ ANY ONE TELL ME ABOUT THE THEFT SECURITY . I AM PLANNING TO BUY THIS WEEK. LAST MONTH MY SAMSUNG ANDROID TAB HAD BEEN STOLEN , STILL I COULD NOT TRACT THE TAB"
Galaxy Note,5,"I JUST GOT MY PHONE FROM FLIPKART. WHEN I UNBOX NOTE 2. FIRST IMPRESSION IS WOW. A MASSIVE BEAST POWERED WITH HIGHEST CONFIGURATION CAN BEAT ANYTHING. SOME OF MY FRIEND SAYS THAT THIS PHONE IS TOO BIG BUT SERIOUSLY THIS PHONE COMES WITH ONE HAND OPERATION MODE. SCREEN IS TOO CLEAR A TRUE HD. POWERED WITH TOO MANY FEATURES LIKE AIRVIEW, GESTURES, SMART STAY, SMART EYE ROTATE, NFC, AND MUCH MORE. SORRY TO MENTION 1 MAIN THING THAT THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY YOU CANT GET THIS FEATURES IN THE MARKET. ALSO THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PHONE IN THE MARKET. NOT IPHONE BECAUSE IPHONE 5 COST IS AROUND 650$. I AM NOT HAPPY TO PAY RS.48000 FOR IPHONE. ALL I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS MUST BUY IF YOU READY TO SPENT 37K. AND THE LAST FLIPKART SERVICE IS AWESOME GOT THE PHONE IN JUST 2 DAYS EVEN AT THE RUSHING DAYS OF DIWALI. THANKS FLIPKART. YO NOTE 2 THE BIG THING IS ALREADY THERE!"
Galaxy Note,5,"I PURCHASED IT A COUPLE OF DAYS BACK FROM FLIPKART. TWO DAYS OF USAGE LED ME TO WRITE ""IT ROCKS"".
      
      
      THE POSITIVES ARE: 8MP CAMERA WITH LED; STUNNING S-PEN; EASY USER INTERFACE; SMART STAY OPERATES IN COORDINATION WITH EYE BLINK); MULTITASKING (AVAILABLE AFTER FIRMWARE UPGRADE); AND AIR VIEW.
      
      
      THE NEGATIVES ARE: LACK OF PRELOADED DOCUMENT EDITOR ESPECIALLY POLARIS OFFICE (MAY BE AVAILABLE IN FUTURE) AND SLIPPERY REAR COVER.
      
      
      THE SUGGESTIONS ARE: A 4-4.8"" MOBILE WITH SUCH A TECHNOLOGY MAY BE A FABULOUS ONE.
      
      
      THE END POINT IS, IT'S AWESOME"
Galaxy Note,5,"I PURCHASED NOTE 2 LAST YEAR, AND MIND YOU I AM STILL AWESTRUCK WITH THE PHONE AND ITS FEATURES
      
      
      THE PHONE INSPITE OF BEING A PHABLET IS VERY SLEEK AND ONE OF THE THINNEST PHONES AROUND.
      
      IT COMES WITH A STYLUS WHICH IS UNIQUE WITH AIR VIEW FEATURE.
      
      
      THE CLARITY IS TRULY MESMERISING AND VIVID. IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE IT IS VERY FAST AND ALSO VERY USERFRIENDLY THANKS TO THE TOUCHWIZ
      
      
      YOU CAN PLAY ALL KINDS OF VIDEOS, MOVIES , HD AS WELL WITH EASE
      
      
      WITH THE CURRENT PRICE OF RS. 27000 AT FLIPKART I GUESS ITS A BEST OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR THIS PHONE
      
      
      PROS:
      
      BEST BATTERY, LASTS MORE THAN 1 DAY IN HEAVY USAGE
      
      VERY PROACTIVE TOUCHSCREEN
      
      BRIGHT COLOURS
      
      STYLUS IS ICING ON THE CAKE
      
      VERY THIN AND EASY TO HOLD
      
      MORE ERGONOMIC THAN NOTE 1
      
      
      CONS:
      
      BUILD IS LITTLE PLASTIKY"
Galaxy Note,5,"I RECEIVED IT TODAY AFTERNOON. AND THIS IS MY GENUINE REVIEW:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. SUPERRRRRRB DISPLAY..I THOUGHT THIS PHONE WOULD BE BIG TO HANDLE. BUT BELIEVE ME GUYS. I HAVE GOT MEDIUM HANDS AND I AM ABLE TO HANDLE IT PROPERLY WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AND THE SAMSUNG KEYBOARD ALSO IS VERY HELPFUL WHEN TYPING SINGLE HANDED. SPECIAL FEATURE OF KEYBOARD SHIFTING SIDES ACCORDING TO RIGHT/LEFT HANDERS.
      
      2. PERFORMANCE IS TOOOOOO GOOD..
      
      3. I HAVE SEEN IN COUPLE OF REVIEWS THAT CAMERA IS JUST AVERAGE. BUT I FOUND IT REALLY GOOD. THIS CAM TAKES REALLY DECENT CLARITY PICS AND THERE IS NO LAG AT ALL FROM ONE PIC TO NEXT PIC.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. EAR PHONES ARE NOT AT ALL GOOD. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE EVEN A BRANDED PHONE/EAR PHONES IF YOU ARE ONLY LISTENING TO MUSIC WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE PHONE. SAMSUNG CAN DO A LOT BETTER REGARDING THIS.
      
      2. I STAY IN BANGALORE AND I USED TO GET MY DELEVERIES ON THE NEXT DAY I ORDERED OR ATLEAST 2ND DAY. BUT THIS ONE TOOK 3 COMPLETE DAYS TO REACH ME. THOUGH I RECEIVED IT AS PER THE DEAD LINE, STILL ITS LATE BEING IN BANGALORE.
      
      3. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WILL BE AN EXACT EXCHANGE. I MEAN I WILL BE PROVIDED WITH NEW PHONE AND THEY WILL TAKE MY OLD PHONE ON THE SAME DAY/TIME. BUT TO MY SURPRISE, FLIPKART GUY CAME TO ME THE DAY BEFORE I GOT MY SG NOTE-2 FOR TAKING MY OLD PHONE. AS I AM HAVING ONE MORE SPARE PHONE, I HAVE RETURNED MY OLD SAMSUNG GALAXY Y. OTHERWISE WHAT IS THE SITUATION?
      
      
      BUT TALKING ABOUT THE PHONE, IT IS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO 4 INCH OR EVEN 4.8 INCH S3 AFTER GETTING USED TO THIS DISPLAY SIZE. THE EXPERIENCE IS JUST 'PHA'NTABULOUS..IT MAY BE A GAME OR READING ON FLIPBOARD OR VIEWING SOME HIGH CLARITY PICS. IT IS GOOD.
      
      
      FINALLY ABOUT EXCHANGE SCHEME. EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT ITS NOT 10K DISCOUNT ON YOUR OLD PHONE.EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS/ THINKING TO BUY MAY ALREADY HAVE DONE ENOUGH RESEARCH ON THE LOCAL MARKET PRICE TAGS AND OTHER ONLINE SITES. IF YOU THINK SO, WAIT FOR 3 TO 4 MONTHS MORE TILL NOTE3 IS RELEASED SO THAT YOU CAN GET IT FOR RS.27500 WITHOUT EXCHANGING YOUR PHONE. ITS MARKETING GUYS...10K IS A BIG NUMBER FOR POSTERS. SO DISCOUNT WILL BE DEFINITELY ON MRP TO HIGHLIGHT THAT 10K FIGURE.
      
      
      HOPE MY REVIEW IS A LITTLE USEFUL...ONE SUGGESTION FOR THE GUYS WHO IS BANGING THEIR HEAD IN CONFUSION JUST BECAUSE OF ONLY ONE THING..SCREEN SIZE..GO FOR IT..AND YOU WILL LATER APPRECIATE YOUR DECISION ..REALLY..I AM ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT I HAVE MENTIONED JUST NOW..:)"
Galaxy Note,5,"I RECEIVED MY GALAXY NOTE 2 VERY PROMPTLY.I ORDERED IT VIA COD.  I AM JUST ABOUT TO GET MY MICRO SIM FOR ME TO USE THE PHONE(CALLING AND MESSAGING).BUT I HAVE USED ALL OTHER FEATURES USING WI-FI WHERE EVEN I MADE VIDEO CALLS ON GTALK AND WAS AWESOME EXPERIENCE.I CAN SAY THAT GALAXY NOTE 2 IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND SEXIEST PHONE. JUST FORGET ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE PHONE BUT SEE HOW GREAT THE DISPLAY IS,EASY FOR BROWSING,GAMING,WATCHING MOVIE ETC.MORE TO ADD THE S-PEN,WOW!!! THAT'S THE GREAT INVENTION.IT'S TIME FOR MOST OF THEM TO SHIFT TO GALAXY NOTE 2 OR EVEN S3 TO FEEL THAT YOU ARE ON TOP OF THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO MOBILES.BUY IT TO FEEL IT!! BUT THE ONLY THING WAS I WAS UPSET WITH THE GIFT THEY GAVE AS FREEBIE WHICH IS NOWHERE MEETING NOTE 2,SAMSUNG MONO BLUETOOTH DEVICE. INSTEAD THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN A GIFT VOUCHER OR FLIP CASE FOR THE SAMSUNG WHICH ARE REALLY ESSENTIAL.I EVEN ASKED THEM BUT THEY DENIED AS THEY ARE UNABLE TO CHANGE THE OFFERS IT SEEMS.THAT'S OK.THANKS FLIPKART FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS SERVICE."
Galaxy Note,5,"I RECEIVED MY ORDER WITHIN THREE DAY OF ORDER BY FLIPKART WHICH VERY FAST SERVICE. NOTE 2 IS NICE MOBILE WITH BIG SCREEN, FAST PROCESSOR. THE MOST NICE IS THING IS ITS S- PEN, VERY HANDY AND EASY TO USE. THANK YOU FLIPKART.COM GIVING ME SUCH GOOD PHONE IN LESS PRICE."
Galaxy Note,5,"I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FEW DAYS BACK FROM FLIPKART BUT SIM CARD COULD NOT BE INSERTED. AFTER GOING THROUGH MANUAL AND SPEAKING TO SAMSUNG, I CAME TO KNOW THAT HANDSET IS COMPATIBLE WITH MICRO SIM CARD ONLY. BUT, I USE DIFFERENT PHONES ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS BY INSERTING THE SAME SIM CARD. BUT, IF I CUT MY SIM CARD FOR NOTE-2, IT WILL BE LIMITED TO NOTE-2 ONLY, WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE SAME IN ANOTHER PHONE. LISTING DID NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT ""MICRO SIM CARD"". FLIPKART SHOULD HAVE STATED THE FACTS IN PRODUCT LISTING.
      
      
      I HAVE, THEREFORE, RETURNED THE PRODUCT. WILL BUY SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE WHICH IS COMPATIBLE WITH NORMAL SIM CARD."
Galaxy Note,5,"I TOOK A LONG TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER TO BUY S3 OR NOTE 2. WAS IN FAVOR OF S3 INITIALLY BECAUSE OF THE SIZE. LATER LOOKING AT THE ALL THE REVIEWS (HUNDREDS OF THEM), DECIDED TO GO FOR NOTE 2. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE UNSURE WHETHER TO BUY NOTE 2 OR NOT BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE. BELIEVE ME, YOU NEED TO USE THIS DEVICE FOR JUST HALF A DAY AND THEN THE SIZE BECOMES PERFECT. IN FACT, THE BEST THING ABOUT NOTE 2 IS ITS SIZE. BROWSING, CHATTING, GAMING IS SUCH A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. THROW IN A TON OF APPLICATIONS AND IT STILL WONT LAG ONE BIT.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL A GREAT DEVICE. AND PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE THIS WITH IPHONE. BOTH ARE SUPREMELY GOOD DEVICES TARGETING DIFFERENT SET OF PEOPLE.
      
      
      ABOUT FLIPKART - DELIVERED THIS TO ME IN EXACTLY 23 HOURS."
Galaxy Note,5,"I WAS IN A CONFUSION WHETHER TO UPGRADE MY PHONE TO GS4 OR GN2. I DID SOME RESEARCH FROM MY OWN CAPABILITY, AND THEN MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY GN2. FROM THE DATE I PUT IT INTO USE, I JUST FELT ITS AWESOME. HERE ARE MY PROS AND CONS FROM THIS PRODUCT
      
      
      A) VERY BIG SCREEN, OPTIMUM TO REPLACE MY TABLET.
      
      B) BUILD IS VERY GOOD. PEOPLE WHO CRY ABOUT PLASTICITY OF SAMSUNG PRODUCTS HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IN REAL. CORNING GORILLA2 GLASSES IS ICING ON THE CAKE. I AM USING THE PHONE WITHOUT ANY KIND OF FLIP-COVER OR SCREEN GUARD FOR VERY FIRST TIME.
      
      C) TOUCHWIZ: I USE IT ON MY TAB2 AS WELL. I ALSO HAVE A SAMSUNG GOOGLE NEXUS AND NEXUS7 WHICH HAVE VANILLA ANDROID. I AGREE THAT GOOGLE RELEASES EARLY SOFTWARE RELEASES FOR LAST 2 DEVICES, BUT IT IS TASTLESS FOR ME. I FIND TOUCHWIZ MAKES TRUE ANDROID CUSTOMIZATION. THERE ARE ZILLION OF FEATURES IN PHONE WHICH I AM YET TO EXPLORE ON THIS PHONE.
      
      D) S-PEN: ITS TRUE INNOVATION FROM SAMSUNG, AND STANDS APART FROM LIKES OF HTC, IPHONE ETC. TRY TAKING QUICK NOTES. ITS VERY CONVENIENT THAN TYPING ON GOOGLE KEEP OR SOME OTHER NOTES APP.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      A) SIZE: I AGREE THAT PHONE IS VERY BIG, AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS PHABLET. SAMSUNG PROVIDES ONE HAND TYPING KEYBOARD WHICH IS COOL AT TIMES.
      
      B) PRICE: ITS BIT ON HIGH END. BUT I PURCHASED FROM EXCHANGE OFFER. THANKS TO SAMSUNG FOR PROVIDING GOOD VALUE FOR MY OLD PHONE :)
      
      C) FONTS: I LIKE TO CUSTOMIZE FONTS SYSTEM-WIDE. BUT I DONT GET SUCH AN OPTION. I DONT LIKE BIG FONTS USED ON STATUS BAR OR ELSEWHERE. I WANT TO CONTROL MY PHONE AS PER MY TASTE.
      
      D) NO-BACKGROUND: BEING SUPER-AMOLED, I WANTED TO JUST SAY NO TO ANY BACKGROUND. BUT ANDROID DOESNT HAVE THIS OPTION(SAME WITH GOOGLE NEXUS) I NEED TO DOWNLOAD A BLACK WALL PAPER AND APPLY IT AS BACKGROUND. BLACK LOOKS DEAD BEAUTIFUL ON THE PHONE.
      
      
      AS FOR CRY BABIES WHICH KEEP CRYING IN FLIPKART AGAINST EXPENSIVE/SAMSUNG PHONES, GO AND GET A LIFE. REMEMBER NOT EVERYONE WILL BUY YOUR ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THESE PHONES. GREAT JOB SAMSUNG!
      
      
      AS FOR FLIPKART, MY FEEDBACK, IMPROVE YOUR LOGISTICS. YOU TAKE TOO LONG TIME TO DELIVER AN ITEM THESE DAYS. I THINK YOU ARE DONE WITH CUSTOMER ACQUISITION PHASE, AND NOW DOING ACTUAL BUSINESS. ONLY ADVANTAGE IS 5% BANK OFFER AVAILABLE HERE. ELSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO SIT WAITING FOR YOUR DELIVERY."
Galaxy Note,5,"I WILL LIKE TO KEEP IT SHORT, SINCE YOU HEAR THE GENERIC THINGS FROM OTHER REVIEWERS.
      
      I LOVE BIG SCREEN MOBILES AND HENCE CHOOSING NOTE 2 WAS NO EYE-BLINDER.
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR 6 MONTHS NOW AND HAVE EVEN BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE FOR MY MOM.
      
      I REALLY LIKE THE TOUCH AND S NOTE IS REALLY INCREDIBLE ONCE YOU MASTER IT.
      
      
      WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO BIG SCREEN LOVERS. I MAY BE BEING BIASED TOWARDS SAMSUNG, BUT OTHER BRANDS LIKE SONY AND HTC DO NOT MATCH NOTE 2 IN TERMS OF SOFTWARE/FIRMWARE. FOR THE HARDWARE SPECS MENTIONED THIS IS THE BEST AVAILABLE SMARTPHONE. :) :)"
Galaxy Note,5,I WON'T BORE YOU WITH THE TECHS. IT IS A GREAT BIG PHONE BUT WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO BUY A COVER AS IT IS VERY SLIPPERY DUE TO THE GLOSSY BACK CASE. THANKS FLIPKART FOR THE TIMELY DELIVERY AND GREAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE EACH TIME!
Galaxy Note,5,"I WOULD USE MY S III FOR ABOUT 1 HOUR PER DAY, MAXIMUM. I USE MY NOTE II AT LEAST 4 HOURS PER DAY. THIS PHONE IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. IT'S LIKE SAMSUNG TOOK EVERYTHING THERE WAS WRONG WITH THE S III (NOT THAT THERE WERE MANY THINGS, THE S III IS ALSO TRULY A FANTASTIC DEVICE), FIXED IT, AND NAMED IT NOTE II. THE SOFTWARE THAT IT COMES WITH IS ASTOUNDING, THE S NOTE APPLICATION IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND POWERFUL. THE FEATURES THAT SAMMY PACKED ARE JUST TOO MANY TO COUNT, REALLY.
      
      
      KEEP IT SHORT: NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE THIS DEVICE. IF YOU'RE IN DILEMMA AND YOU'RE WONDERING IF YOU SHOULD GET IT, GET IT. I HAD THE SAME DILEMMA AND I DON'T REGRET MY DECISION FOR A SPLIT SECOND."
Galaxy Note,5,IF I HAVE NOTE 2 THEN I DON'T NEED TO BUY A TABLET AGAIN FOR ITS BIG 5.55-INCH SUPER AMOLED SCREEN_THE BATTERY IS ALSO MOST POWERFUL IN THIS RANGE_THE PIXEL IS SIMILAR TO S3 BUT THE FONT IS BIGGER AS THE SCREEN SIZE IS BIGGER_1.6 GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR_2 GB RAM_SIMPLY A POWER-HOUSE_MY BEST DEVICE.???
Galaxy Note,5,"IF YOU ARE USED TO A REGULAR NOKIA PHONES....IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT A DAY TO LEARN ALL THAT. YOU WONT DO THE FIRST CHARGING OF THIS PHONE UNTIL YOU GET USED TO THE INITIAL PART OF IT. ITS A GREAT PHONE AND LOTS AND LOTS OF FEATURES.
      
      
      GREAT BUY..!!!"
Galaxy Note,5,"I'M USING THIS BEAUTY FOR 2 MONTHS NOW AND IT IS A MIRACLE! THE STUFF I CAN DO WITH THE NOTE 2 IS UNTHINKABLE ON OTHER PHONES. EVEN AT THE TOP END, NOTE 2 IS THE BEST PHONE AND OFFERS THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY.

Galaxy Note,5,"ITS A VERY VERY NICE DEVICE...ALL  OPTIONS ARE AMAZING.......REALLY I PROUD TO BY A SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 N7100,RAM SPEED IS WELL.....PROCESSOR ALSO GOOD..............INTERNET BROWSING PERFORMANCE IS NICE........."
Galaxy Note,5,"ITS BIG. VERY BIG. BUT THEN AGAIN I HAVE BIG HANDS AND NEEDED A BATTERY THAT CAN TAKE A BEATING THROUGH THE DAY AND NOT DIE ON ME BY 5PM.
      
      
      THE SCREEN IS BRILLIANT. THE SPEED &AMP; FLUIDITY SPECTACULAR - QUADCORE &AMP; PROJECT BUTTER REALLY HELPS! AND THE BATTERY REMINDS ME OF THE ENERGIZER BUNNY.
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF ITS HUGE BATTERY LIFE VS. THE S3 WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD AND MANAGE. BUT I HAVE BEEN BLOWN AWAY BY THE SCREEN. I CAN'T IMAGINE VIEWING CONTENT/PLAY GAMES ETC ETC ON A SMALLER SCREEN ANYMORE.
      
      
      NEGATIVES - PLASTIC BODY - WHILE IT DOESN'T FEEL CHEAP IT DOESN'T FEEL PREMIUM EITHER."
Galaxy Note,5,I'VE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM FEB 13  NOW AND I CAN RIGHTLY TELL YOU THIS IS BEST PHONE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER USED. IT IS VERY FAST WITH ITS 1.6 GHZ QUAD CORE CORTEX-A9 PROCESSOR AND 2GB RAM. SCREEN IS ABSOLUTE JOY TO LOOK AT WITH THE VIBRANT COLORS. ITS VERY GOOD EVEN FOR READING EBOOKS &AMP; BROWSING. THE MULTIWINDOW REALLY SHOWS THE PHONES CAPABILITY.THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE OF THIS IS PHONE IS ITS BATTERY LIFE. YOU CAN FORGET THE CHARGER FOR THE WEEKEND TRIP &AMP; STILL EXPECT THE CHARGE TO BE PRESENT WHEN YOU RETURN. I EVEN GOT 3 DAYS WITH ABOUT 2 HR WIFI USAGE PER DAY WITH 1-2 HOUR VIDEO PER DAY AND OTHER TASKS. STYLUS IS SOMETHING UNIQUE TO THIS PHONE AND SAMSUNG HAS SUCCEEDED TO A GREAT EXTENT IN IT. MY ONLY COMPLAIN IS THEY COULD HAVE HAVE IMPROVED THE BUILT QUALITY NEVERTHELESS IT IS STILL A SOLID PHONE. ALSO HOPING THEY WILL ADD THE SCREEN RECORDER FUNCTION AS ADVERTISED. IF YOU DON'T MIND USING A LARGE PHONE(IT IS STILL POCKETABLE). NOW I ORDERED MY SECOND SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 MOBILE PHONE FROM FLIPKART AND ALSO GET 15% CASH BACK WITH 12 MONTHS EMI OPTION.

      BEHAVIOURAL:
      
      
      1) IF YOU ARE SOMEONE EARNING LESS THAN 75K  A MONTH (POST TAX), THEN YOU WILL END UP REGRETTING SPENDING MONEY ON A SMALL DEVICE (FORGET CAPABILITIES), SOONER OR LATER ON. I DON'T FALL IN THIS CATEGORY.
      
      2) IF YOU ARE A FEMALE, IT'LL SLIP FROM YOUR HANDS OFTEN (NO OFFENSE, YOU GOT SMALLER HANDS). I'M A MALE.
      
      3) IF YOU ARE IN THE HABIT OF TAKING OUT YOUR PHONE WHILE TRAVELLING ON BIKE, PLEASE RESIST BUYING - IT CAN'T TAKE A 4 FOOT FALL ON TARMAC.
      
      4) IF YOU ARE PAST 40, GET A BLACKBERRY OR IPHONE- THIS IS MEANT FOR YOUNGER ONES WHO CAN EXPLORE THE APPS WORLD (IM 29).
      
      5) YOU CANNOT GO BACK TO SMALLER SCREENS ONCE YOU GET USED TO THIS - IT SUCKS USING SMALLER PHONES AFTER YOU USE THIS BEAST.
      
      
      USAGE:BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU ARE IN THE HABIT OF, WITH YOUR EXISTING PHONE, AND YOU WOULD BE SURE OF CONTINUING THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES EVEN AFTER 2 MONTHS OF PURCHASE:
      
      
      1) WATCHING 1080 MOVIES WHILE TRAVELLING
      
      2) LOVE OUTDOOR PHOTOGRAPHY, AND IS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT ALL MOBILE PHONES SUCK WHEN IT COMES TO INDOOR PICTURES.
      
      3) USE PHONE EXTENSIVELY FOR MUSIC
      
      4) INSTALL HIGH CAPACITY (&GT;2GB) GAMES LIKE NFS
      
      5) USE VIBER AND WHATSAPP VERY FREQUENTLY
      
      6) SYNC GOOGLE+, GMAIL ETC
      
      7) FIND EXCITEMENT IN GETTING NEW APPS AND TRYING THEM OUT
      
      8) LAST BUT NOT  THE LEAST, WANT PEOPLE TO LOOK AT YOU WHEN YOU HOLD THIS IN YOUR PALM
      
      
      LET ME TELL YOU MY EXPERIENCE: I DO ALL THE ACTIVITIES ABOVE: THE PHONES GREAT BECAUSE
      
      
      1) EXCELLENT, IF NOT THE BEST DISPLAY IN THE INDUSTRY
      
      2) GOOD CONNECTIVITY (CALL &AMP; 3G) AT ALL TIMES

Galaxy Note,5,"MY OVERALL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE IS AMAZING.
      
      
      1.IN TERMS OF BATTERY THE PHONE PROVIDES BETTER POWER BACKUP AND BATTERY CHARGES VERY FASTLY.
      
      2.CAMERA IS PRETTY GOOD AND VIDEO RECORDING IS VERY CLEAR.
      
      3.GAMES ARE VERY MUCH PLAYABLE.
      
      4.TOUCH IS PRETTY NICE.
      
      5.SIZE IS NICE FOR USERS WHO LIKE BIG SCREEN TO WATCH MOVIES AND PLAY GAMES.
      
      
      MY PERSONAL OPINION : THIS IS A GREAT PHONE TO BUY"
Galaxy Note,5,"MY PRIMARY REQUIREMENT WAS A BIG SCREEN PHONE, SCREEN SIZE JUST ENOUGH, ABOUT 5.8 INCHES. TO ME THAT IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR A PHABLET. AT 5.5 INCH THIS IS A SLIGHT COMPROMISE, BUT I'LL SURVIVE. I KNOW THERE IS A 5.9 INCH NOTE 3 COMING, BUT I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.
      
      NOTE 2 IS A VERY GOOD PHONE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A REQUIREMENT OF A PHABLET.
      
      PROS: GOOD SCREEN, GOOD CAMERA, STYLUS, HIGH SPEED PROCESSOR, GREAT BATTERY LIFE, VERY COMPETITIVE PRICING
      
      CONS: POOR BUILD QUALITY. WONDER WHEN WILL SAMSUNG GET IT RIGHT. I AM OKAY TO PAY A COUPLE OF GRANDS MORE IF YOU GET A BETTER BUILD QUALITY.
      
      
      DEAR REVA R,
      
      YOURS WAS AN INTERESTING REIVEW. THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY. ITS FOR PEOPLE ON THE GO. FOR EXECUTIVES, WHO HAVE A PACKED DAY OR FOR PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL A LOT. ITS A PRODUCTIVITY DEVICE, ITS AN ENTERTAINMENT DEVICE, ITS A NAVIGATION DEVICE, ITS A LIFE EVENT CAPTURING DEVICE, ITS A NOTE TAKING DEVICE.
      
      YOU SAY YOU COULD BUY A HD TV AT 36K. YOU ARE OKAY TO SPEND THAT MUCH ON A HD TV BUT NOT ON A HD MOBILE. ITS LIKE SAYING THAT FOR EVERYBODY HDTV IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MOBILE. I AM SORRY BUT THATS NOT TRUE. TO ME, I RARELY GET TO WATCH TV.
      
      
      A BIG SCREEN SMARTPHONE, WAS MY REQUIREMENT AND AT THIS MOMENT THIS ONE IS THE BEST AVAILABLE AT THIS PRICE.
      
      
      THANKS, ROHAN"
Galaxy Note,5,"NICELY DESIGNED AND CRAFTED PRODUCT. THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR PROMPT DELIVERY.
      
      I MUST SAY AFTER OWNING A IPAD FOR LAST 3-4 YEARS THIS IS THE FIRST GADGET WHICH HAS IMPRESSED ME. I WOULD RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT TO ALL THE TECH SAVVY PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD THE PRICE."
Galaxy Note,5,"NOTE 2 IS CURRENTLY THE BEST ANDROID PHONE, ARGUABLY EVEN BETTER THAN S4. I'VE TRIED S4 MYSELF AND SEEN FRIENDS RETURNING/SELLING THEIR S4 FOR NOTE2.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      - SCREEN THATS LARGE AND BRILLIANT
      
      - EPIC BATTERY LIFE
      
      - VERY POCKETABLE
      
      
      CONS:
      
      - BUNDLED SAMSUNG SOFTWARE IS USESLESS AND SOME OF IT UNINSTALLABLE"
Galaxy Note,5,"NOTE II IS THE BEST PHONE I EVER HAD SO FAR. IT WORKS BUTTERY SMOOTH AND WATCHING HD VIDEOS ON IT IS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE. I WILL SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO WANTS EVERYTHING IN AN ANDROID DEVICE,PLEASE PLEASE GO FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE II.
      
      ALSO THANKS FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING IT ON 2ND DAY OF PAYMENT.
      
      THANKS AGAIN......"
Galaxy Note,5,"OF ALL THE PHONES AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET, THIS ONE IS THE BEST.
      
      
      THE SPECS OF THIS MAMMOTH 5.5 INCH SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY 1280 X 720 PIXELS DEVICE ARE UNPARALLEL TO ANY OTHER MOBILE PHONE OUT THERE.
      
      
      THE 1.6 GHZ QUAD CORE EXYNOS PROCESSOR COUPLED WITH 2 GB RAM ENABLES BUTTERY SMOOTH FUNCTIONING.
      
      
      GOOGLE'S ANDROID JELLYBEAN 4.1.1 WITH GOOGLE VOICE AND GOOGLE NOW IS SIMPLE AWESOME.
      
      
      APART FROM THIS, S-PEN AND ITS ASSOCIATED APPS MAKE IT A FULLY PRODUCTIVE DEVICE.
      
      
      THE 8MP HD CAMERA AT THE BACK AND 2MP CAMERA AT THE FRONT ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE NICE &AMP; BEAUTIFUL SHOTS. BEST FACE FEATURE MAKES PHOTOGRAPHY ON THIS DEVICE EVEN BETTER.
      
      
      THIS DEVICE IS ALSO A MEDIA POWERHOUSE WITH ONBOARD 16/32/64 GB OF SPACE EXPANDABLE UP TO FURTHER 64 GB.
      
      
      WHEN IT COMES TO POWER BACKUP, NOTE 2 IS POWERED BY A 3100 MAH BATTERY WHICH RUNS FOR 2 DAYS STRAIGHT WITH NORMAL CALLING, AUDIO LISTENING, MOVIE WATCHING &AMP; INTERNET SURFING.
      
      
      LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST THE DEVICE THIS DEVICE HAS NFC ? A COOL NEW WAY TO SHARE CONTENT.
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS DEVICE SINCE LAST 6 MONTH AND I AM ALREADY ADDICTED TO IT.
      
      
      ALL SAY ADDICTION IS BAD. I SAY ADDICTION IS GOOD; YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE A NICE TASTE. ?"
Galaxy Note,5,"OK I HAD BEEN FOLLOWING NOTE 2 EVER SINCE ITS RELEASE BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET MY HANDS ON IT BECAUSE OF THE PRICE BUT THANKS TO THE SAMSUNG EXCHANGE OFFER I HAVE IT NOW \M/...
      
      
      COMING TO THE PHONE
      
      PROS:
      
      1.DUE TO IT'S BIG SCREEN MANY PEOPLE FEEL IT IS DIFFICULT TO HANDLE BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH IT; LEAVING THE RARE CASES NOW AND THEN... AND ONCE YOU GET USED TO THIS SIZE IT'S HARD TO GO BACK TO SMALLER MOBILES ( READ: IPHONE)
      
      
      2.THE BATTERY IS TOO GOOD I EASILY LAST A DAY AND HALF EVEN AFTER TOTAL ABUSE OF MY PHONE (3G, HIGH GRAPHIC GAMES, MESSAGING)
      
      
      3.S-PEN -- THIS IS ONE HARDWARE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT MISS... I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER USE IT BUT TO MY SURPRISE I KEEP USING IT THE MORE AND MORE I GET TO KNOW OF IT'S VARIOUS FEATURES. IT'S GREAT FUN TOO
      
      
      4.THE DISPLAY IS GOOD AND THE CAMERA TOO IS DECENT NOT THE BEST IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW BUT YOU WON'T FEEL BAD USING IT... THOUGH LOW LIGHT IMAGES MAY LEAVE YOU DISAPPOINTED.
      
      
      5.THE EXTERNAL MEMORY AND REPLACEABLE BATTERY ARE ALSO GOOD TO HAVE.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1.THE USB CHARGER CABLE IS VERY SMALL... I HATE IT.
      
      2.THE GRAPHICS PROCESSOR IS NOT THE BEST AND WHEN YOU PLAY GRAPHIC-INTENSIVE GAMES IT SHOWS UP A LITTLE
      
      3.I'M NOT A FAN OF TOUCHWIZ AT ALL THE CARTOONISH ICONS AND INTERFACE IS NOT FOR ME I PREFER THE STOCK ANDROID ANYDAY BUT THERE ARE GOOD LAUNCHERS OUT THERE WHICH CAN MAKE UP FOR IT"
Galaxy Note,5,"OK SO IT'S ABOUT 3 WEEKS I'VE BEEN USING THIS FABULOUS PHONE. I FIND IT AMONG THE MOST POWERFUL HANDSETS IN THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT. THE OS ANDROID 4.1 JELLY BEAN ON BOARD MAKES THE DEVICE PART OF A REALLY PRIVILEGED CLUB OF GADGETS, BEATING THE LATEST VERSION OF THE GOOGLE MOBILE OS. THE S PEN HAS ALSO MADE QUANTUM LEAPS COMPARED TO ITS PREDECESSOR..AWESOME.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE II TICKS MANY OF THE RIGHT BOXES AND DELIVER AS GREAT AN EXPERIENCE AS ITS INTERNATIONAL VERSION. NORMALLY, WE'D SAY THAT'S AN OFFER YOU SHOULDN'T MISS, BUT GIVEN THAT THE GALAXY NOTE II IS ALSO AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE DEVICES ON THE INDIAN MARKET.
      
      
      ONLY DISADVANTAGES I SEE:
      
      LARGE SIZE MAKES SINGLE-HAND OPERATION A BIT PROBLEMATIC.
      
      ADOBE HAS REMOVED SUPPORT ON JELLY BEAN SO NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DEVICE HOWEVER FLASH CURRENTLY DOES WORK.
      
      DOESN'T HAVE FM RADIO.
      
      ALL PLASTIC BODY."
Galaxy Note,5,"ONE WORD FOR THIS PHONE------------------ AWESOME
      
      
      ORDERED VIA FLIKART YESTERDAY AND GOT THE PHONE TODAY ULTIMATE SPEED DELIVERY BY FLIPKART.
      
      GOT AN AMAZING DEAL IN FLIPKART 5% OFF ON THE PHONE  AND 15% CASH BACK I AM ONE OF THE LUCKIEST SON OF GUN IN THE WORLD GOT THIS PHONE FOR 29500
      
      I WAS PLANNING TO BUY SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND DUOS I9082 BUT WHEN I SAW THE IRRESISTIBLE OFFER I HAD TO GO FOR IT
      
      I AM HAVING A BLAST WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT SO MANY PRODUCTS IN FLIPKART  BUT NEVER HAD WRITTEN A REVIEW BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AM WRITING REVIEW OF THE PRODUCT RECEIVED WITH COMPLETE SATISFACTION
      
      
      I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OTHER REVIEWS BUT THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I RECOMMEND THIS FOR EVERYONE"
Galaxy Note,5,"OPEN ANY NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS IT DOES NOT SLOWS DOWN....BATTERY RUNS SMOOTHLY FOR MORE THAN 2 DAYS WITH MODERATE USAGE. HUGE PROCESSOR, HUGE RAM, APPLICATIONS OPEN AS SMOOTH AS SLICING BUTTER, BIG SCREEN MAKES PLAYING GAMES AND READING A SHEER PLEASURE, S PEN AND S NOTE ARE REMARKABLE, CAMERA IS PRETTY DECENT AT 8 MEGAPIXEL( PEOPLE WANTING MORE SHOULD BUY SLRS),  AIR VIEW IS ANOTHER INNOVATION, IT IS MILES AHEAD OF ANY CONTEMPORARY MOBILE....USING IT FOR MORE THAN A MONTH NOW ABSOLUTELY NO LAGS EXPERIENCED..... SOME PEOPLE MAY COMPLAIN ITS A BIT TOO BIG.... BUT THAT IS THE EXACT REASON WHY I BOUGHT IT...AS A PHONE IT STANDS OUT FROM ALL THE OTHER PHONES. ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS"
Galaxy Note,5,"PEOPLE WHO'RE WONDERING, AS FOR WHY THEY SHOULD BY NOTE II DESPITE THE S4 AND HTC ONE RELEASE HERE'S SOMETHING TO PONDER OVER.
      
      
      I'VE OWNED THIS DEVICE FOR A MONTH NOW, AND A FRIEND OF MINE HAS OWNED ONE FOR 4 MONTHS. AND I CAN VOUCH FOR THIS AMAZING DEVICE. I INITIALLY BOUGHT THIS MERELY FOR THE GINORMOUS SCREEN, BUT WAS DUMBFOUNDED BY THE POWER THAT THE NOTE 2 PACKS. AND I'VE NOT EVEN EXPLORED IT IN ENTIRETY. GREAT SCREEN, BEST BATTERY LIFE FOR ANY ANDROID DEVICE I'VE EVER USED - THESE ALONE MAKES THE DEVICE GREAT. ALTHOUGH S-PEN SEEMED A GIMMICK INITIALLY, I'M IN LOVE WITH IT NOW AND USE IT ON A DAILY BASIS. AND THE SPEAKER QUALITY IS SURPRISINGLY AMAZING, AND IF YOU HAVE ROOTED GN2, IT'S JUST OUT OF THE WORLD. CAMERA QUALITY IS FINE, BUT THE STOCK APP IS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, THIS IS A PHONE YOU'LL HANG ON TO FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SPECS, YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT ONCE YOU BEGIN USING IT.
      
      
      PS: I HAVE NO IDEA HOW SUCH A STUPID COMMENT GOT VOTED AS ""MOST HELPFUL"". HDTV AND ACS GET UPGRADES TOO - EVERY SINGLE TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES. IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THAT, WHY FEEL THE NEED TO COME OVER HERE AND SPAM YOUR NARROW MINDED OPINIONS HERE? DON'T BUY. SAVE YOUR PREACHY NONSENSE FOR YOURSELF AND DON'T BUY ANY SMARTPHONE. END OF."
Galaxy Note,5,"PRODUCTS COMES AND SETTLES AND GOES AWAY, FEW MAKES THEIR MARKS AND FEW JUST FADES AWAY. NO DOUBT EVERY SMARTPHONE YOU BUY TODAY WOULD BE FEELING LIKE OUTDATED IN 6 TO 12 MONTHS AND THAT'S THE CURRENT TREND OF MOBILE INDUSTRY! BUT EVEN AFTER THIS ONLY FEW PRODUCTS MANAGES TO CREATE HISTORY AND NO DOUBT GALAXY NOTE 2 IS ONE OF THEM. I AM NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT RAM, PROCESSOR SPECS, BENCHMARKS ETC. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE FOR BEING FUTURE-PROOF FOR AT LEAST 1.5 YEARS. WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS USER EXPERIENCE. 5.5"" SCREEN MAKES IT SLAPPING ANY OTHER DEVICE IN MARKET. SINCE I  BOUGHT THIS MOBILE I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I SWITCHED ON MY LAPTOP! ANDROID 4.1.1 (WAITING FOR OFFICIAL UPGRADE TO 4.1.2) GIVES YOU THE BEST OS THIS LEGEND COULD CURRENTLY HAVE. TOUCH EXPERIENCE SMOOTHER THAN BUTTER. YES, PROJECT BUTTER SHOWS ITS STRENGTH! S PEN IS FANTASTIC INNOVATION. YOU CAN USE IT FOR S PLANNER, S MEMO, S NOTES AND EVEN FOR QUICK COMMANDS, CLIPPING ETC. MORE S PEN APPS IF INCREASES IN MARKET WILL MAKE S PEN TO SHOW ITS FULL STRENGHT. OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION LITERALLY FETCHES OUT 99% TIME CORRECT TEXT FOR WHATEVER WEIRD YOUR HANDWRITING IS. IT FEELS SUCH A WONDERFUL WHEN DEVICE WITH AMAZING HARDWARE RESPONDS WITH AMAZING SOFTWARE. CAMERA INTERFACE GIVES YOU LOT OF OPTIONS TO PLAY WITH BUT I DOUBT IF ONE HAS SLR HE/SHE WILL NEVER LIKE THIS CAMERA. BUT THIS DEVICE'S CAMERA IS REPLACEMENT FOR FOR MOST OF POINT N SHOOT. OVERALL CAMERA IS NOT GREAT BUT  GOOD WITH SO MANY OPTIONS, SOFTWARE TWEAKS TO PLAY WITH MAKES IT POWERFUL. DEVICE WITH DEMON SPECS HAS TO COME WITH GOOD FUEL TO SUPPORT ITS STRENGHT AND GALAXY NOTE 2'S BATTERY IS REALLY GOOD AND GETS YOU THROUGH 1.5 TO 2 DAYS OF NORMAL USAGE. SCREEN COLOR REPRODUCTION IS OUTSTANDING CONSIDERING THE FACT THE RGB MATRIX USED WITH 12 SUBPIXELS. MOST OF MY PICS WHICH SHOT WITH DSLR LOOKS GREAT ON THIS DEVICE RATHER THAN ON LAPTOP!
      
      LOT OF TALKS ARE GOING IN MARKET REGARDING 440PPI ETC. GALAXY NOTE 2 HAVE 275PPI BUT YOU HAVE LARGER SCREEN AT THE SAME AND THIS MEANS THIS DEVICE GIVES PERFECT COMBINATION OF SHARPNESS AND VISIBLE REAL ESTATE OF SCREEN WHICH NO OTHER DEVICE IN CURRENT MARKET GIVES YOU! AFTERALL 275PPI DEPTH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH. MUSIC PLAYER AND SOUND QUALITY IS ONE OF THE GREATEST I HAVE SEEN LONG TIME AFTER SONY'S WALKMAN SERIES. SOFTWARES LIKE MUSIC SQUARE ARE JUST AMAZING AND IT WORKS - ALLOWS YOU TO TAP SQUARES ON GRID ACCORDING TO MOOD AND IT SELECTES SONGS AUTOMATICALLY (MINIMUM 25 SONGS ARE NEEDED TO WORK THIS).
      
      NOW LET ME TALK ABOUT FEW CONS OF THIS DEVICE :
      
      1) THIS MAY NOT FIT YOUR POCKETS AND HANDS BUT YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO HIDE IT IN YOUR POCKET!
      
      2) FROM HARDWARE PERSPECTIVE BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD BUT FEW SOFTWARE GLITCHES IN ANDROID (LIKE RUNNING MANY BACKGROUND PROCESSES, CACHING UNWANTED APPLICATIONS) MAKES IT HARD TO UTILISE BATTERY'S FULL POTENTIAL. I BELIEVE SAMSUNG WILL FIX THESE WITH UPDATES IN FUTURE. DEEP SLEEP OPTIMISATIONS NEEDS TO BE OPTIMISED MORE. IF YOU ARE IN POOR NETWORK AREA BATTERY JUST VAPORISES.
      
      3) FACEBOOK INTEGRATION IS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. SAMSUNG SHOULD HAVE BUILD THEIR OWN FACEBOOK INTERFACE INSTEAD OF RELYING ON STANDARD ONE.
      
      4) N7100 MODEL DOES NOT SUPPORT LTE. REMEMBER THIS. LTE MODEL IS N7105 AND I DOUBT IS IT IS AVAILABLE IN INDIAN MARKET.
      
      5) BUILD QUALITY COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BETTER FOR DEVICE WITH 37K PRICE. MAYBE THEY COULD HAVE USED SOME THIN STEEL PANEL INSTEAD OF PLASTIC AT BACK. BUT PLASTIC AT BACK EVEN LOOKS GOOD ESPECIALLY WHITE LOOKS GREAT.
      
      
      ABOUT FLIPKART : GOOD SERVICE. ACTUALLY THIS TIME IT WAS REPLACEMENT FOR ME AS ORIGINALLY ORDERED DEVICE HAD DISPLAY ISSUE. FLIPKART NEEDS TO IMPROVE UPON THEIR REPLACEMENT SPEED. AFTERALL NOBODY JUST WANT TO PAY 37K AND SIT N WAIT FOR NEW PRODUCT BEING AVAILABLE IN 6 DAYS. YES IT TOOK 6 DAYS TO REPLACE IT WHICH IS LONG TIME.
      
      
      OVERALL THIS DEVICE IS GREATEST ONE CURRENTLY PRODUCED BY SAMSUNG AND WILL BE REMEMBERED IN HISTORY FOR ITS INNOVATION AND INSPIRATION TO NEW GENERATION OF PRODUCTS.

Galaxy Note,5,"PROS,
      
      1. SCREEN TOUCH IS LIKE HEAVEN, NEVER BEFORE SEEN SMOOTH GLASS LIKE THIS. THIS IS THE REASON I HAVE DELIBERATELY AVOIDED SCRATCH GUARD TO KEEP THAT TOUCH EXPERIENCE AS IT IS(FINGERS CROSSED I WON'T EXPERIENCE SCRATCHES DUE TO GORRILA GLASS 2)
      
      2. HARDWARE WITH JELLY BEAN AND SAMSUNG'S TOUCHWIZ USER INTERFACE GIVES SUPER SMOOTH FUNCTIONALITY
      
      3. MASSIVE 5.5 INCHES SCREEN WITH HD QUALITY GIVES SUPER SHARP EXPERIENCE TO SEE HD MOVIES AND PICS AND VIDEOS TAKEN FROM ITS CAMERA AS WELL.
      
      4. GAMES RUN WITHOUT ANY LAG DUE TO SUPER HEAVY HARDWARE, ALSO MAILI-400 GPU GIVES VERY GOOD GRAPHICS LIKE PC GAMES. I JUST DOWNLOADED MANY GAMES JUST TO SEE GRAPHICS AND CLARITY OF GAMES.
      
      
      CONS,
      
      1. BOTH HANDS ARE NECCESSARY TO HANDLE IT EVERY TIME, AFTER ALL NOBODY WANTS TO DROP IT AFTER GIVING 38K BUGS
      
      2. WEIGHT IS AROUND 180 G WHICH IS LITTLE BIT HEAVY THAN ANY NORMAL PHONE SO U CAN'T HOLD IT FOR LONGER TIME WITH 1 HAND
      
      
      BUT AFTER ALL U HAVE TO SACRIFY SOMETHING TO GET THAT UNBEATABLE, UNSEEN EXPERIENCE SO WE CAN'T DIRECTLY BLAME IT ;)"
Galaxy Note,5,"PURCHASED SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 N7100 LAST WEEK AND THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED WITHIN THE MENTIONED TIMELINE. GOOD SHOW BY FLIPKART AS THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED INTACT.
      
      
      HAD DONE RESEARCH ON THE HANDSET AND HAD ZEROED IN ON THIS PRODUCT COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK. I WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE OFFER AND HAD EXCHANGED A 2.5 YEARS OLD SAMSUNG GALAXY DUOS MOBILE FOR THIS MOBILE (THOROUGHLY USED). HAD JUST RETURNED IT ALONG WITH THE CHARGER AND THEY HAD NOT INSISTED FOR ORIGINAL PACKING LIKE SOME OTHER SITES HAD.
      
      
      VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT, DELIVERY AND THE OFFER.."
Galaxy Note,5,"REALLY FAST, DISPLAY RESOLUTION IS GOOD, BUT THE ICING ON THE CAKE IS THE S-PEN. BATTERY BACKUP IS ALSO VERY GOOD.
      
      BETTER THAN ANY IPHONE IN MY OPINION.

Galaxy Note,5,"SUCH AN AWESOME PHONE AND VALUE FOR MONEY.. VERY STYLISH.. ONLY DRAW BACK IS THAT IF YOU DROP IT/ SCREEN IS BROKEN(WHICH IS NOT THAT EASY BCOZ OF SUPER AMOLED CAPACITIVE SCREEN)
      
      THIS PHONE IS VERYYY AWESOME.. APP RUN SO SMOOTHLY.. IT HARDLY HANGS.. JELLY BEANS IS AWESOME.. SCREEN SIZE FITS FOR ME..!! BEST PHONE TILL NOW..!!"
Galaxy Note,5,"THE GADGET IS WONDERFUL. I WILL NOT COMMENT ON PRICING. I VERY WELL KNEW THE SAME AND I WENT FOR IT AND I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE. SCORES BEYOND COMPARISON OVER COMPETITOR BREEDS FROM IPHONE , SONY, LG. LOOK AND FEEL ALONG WITH UI IS VERY FRIENDLY. EVEN MY 5 YEAR OLD HAS GOT ACCLIMATIZED TO ITS OPERATION WITH PRECISION AND THAT SHOWS WHAT PRODUCT DESIGNING IS ALL ABOUT. CANNOT BE ONLY RATED AS KEWL FOR THE HAPPY GO LUCKY YOUTH BUT A WONDERFUL TOKEN OF GRATITUDE EVEN FOR THE ELDERLY. ALL WILL LOVE IT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF ITS EASE OF OPERATION"
Galaxy Note,5,"THE NOTE 2 HAS EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR DUAL SIM (NOT REALLY NEEDED FOR ME). THE S-PEN FEATURE IS UNIQUE ONLY TO THIS ONE AND THE OLDER NOTE. TRUST ME THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS BEAST IS SO GOOD THAT ANY APPLICATION WILL EASILY RUN AND THE REFINEMENT AND UI ARE SO NICE THAT ANY OTHER PHONE YOU USE WILL FEEL SUB PAR. DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE HUGE SIZE, U WILL DEFINITELY GET USED TO IT IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND IT EASILY FITS INTO YOUR JEANS OR FRONT SHIRT POCKET. WHEN YOU BUY THE NOTE 2 YOU BUY A SUPREME QUALITY PRODUCT WHICH WILL SERVE YOU FOR YEARS TO COME AND THE ADVANCED HARDWARE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU EVEN AFTER 2-3 YEARS. I FEEL VERY HAPPY HAVING BOUGHT IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO CAN AFFORD IT (DO NOT BUY IF YOUR BUDGET IS LESS THAN 15K) BUT IF YOU DO BE PREPARED TO RECEIVE AMAZED AND JEALOUS GLANCES FROM ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT IT. IT BEATS EVERY OTHER PHONE, NOT ONLY IN LOOKS BUT IN PERFORMANCE AND FEATURES AS WELL. IT IS DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN WITH THEIR SMARTPHONES AND TRUST THE BATTERY TO LAST AT LEAST A DAY (WITH HEAVY USAGE) AND 2 DAYS (MODERATE USAGE) OR 3 DAYS EVEN!!( WITH LIGHT USAGE). THE NUMBER OF FEATURES AND COOL STUFF THAT IS PACKED INTO IT ARE TOO MANY TO LIST HERE, BUT REST ASSURED THAT APART FROM DUAL SIM, THERE IS NOTHING THIS POWERFUL PHABLET CANNOT DO. ONLY CONS ACCORDING TO ME-
      
      1. THE PHONE NEEDS PROPER COVER (PROTECTION TO PREVENT ANY DAMAGE IF IT FALLS/BUMPS)
      
      2. THE PREMIUM-NESS OF THIS PHONE WILL SUCK YOU IN AND OTHER PHONES WILL PALE IN COMPARISON. :)"
Galaxy Note,5,"THE PHONE IS REALLY AWESOME WITH ALL ITS COOL FEATURES THE BEST ONE BEING S NOTE AND MULTI-TASKING. OTHER COOL FEATURES ARE THE CAMERA AND VIDEO PLAYER FUNCTIONS. THE PHONE IS NOT THAT BIG LIKE IMAGINED AND CAN BE CONVENIENTLY HANDLED. I HAVE SEEN SOME DROP TESTS ON YT AND THE PHONE IS REALLY A TOUGH ONE.
      
      
      SO GUYS GO AHEAD AND BUY THE PHONE ITS WORTH THE MONEY SPENT AND IF PURCHASED ONLINE PREFER FLIPKART. THE SHIPPING IS ALWAYS FAST AND SAFE AT FLIPKART. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABT THE SHIPPING OF SUCH A COSTLY PRODUCT."
Galaxy Note,5,"THE PHONE IS VERY LARGE COMPARED TO OTHERS BUT NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A DORK WHILE CALLING. ITS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A PHONE AND A TABLET, GIVING YOU THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.
      
      THE PROCESSOR IS A QUAD CORE 1.6GHZ ONE, GIVING THE NOTE 2 A PROCESSING POWER EQUAL TO THAT OF A PC. THE SCREEN IS LARGE, BUT IT SHOULD EASILY FIT IN THE HANDS OF AN ADULT. THE SCREEN IS SHARP AS EXPECTED OF A SUPER AMOLED SCREEN. PICTURE QUALITY IS GREAT, COLOURS ARE VIVID AND PICTURES ARE SHARP. THE RAM IS 2 GB , ALLOWING YOU TO PERFORM MORE PROCESSES AT ONCE AND REDUCE LAG. THIS PHONES PERFORMANCE IS EQUAL TO THAT OF A PC. THE BATTERY LIFE IS EXCELLENT, AND MORE THAN S3'S.  PEOPLE GO FOR THE S3 MORE, 'CAUSE OF ITS SIZE. BUT SOME FAIL TO NOTICE THAT THE NOTE 2'S PERFORMANCE GREATLY OVERSHADOWS S3'S.
      
      THE S PEN IS A GREAT ADDITION, GIVING AN ACCURATE TOUCH EXPERIENCE. THE PHONE IS A BIT HEAVY AND DIFFICULT TO CARRY AROUND , SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN A BAG, AS IT MAY NOT FIT IN THE POCKET, SO I RECOMMEND A BLUETOOTH HEADSET TO BE USED WITH THIS.
      
      OVERALL THIS PHONE IS GREAT, HAVE NOT FOUND ANY CONS. I PREFER THIS OVER S3. GREAT JOB SAMSUNG."
Galaxy Note,5,"THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 IS A NICHE DEVICE. WITH ITS 5.5 INCH SUPER AMOLED SCREEN IT IS ONE OF THE BEST SCREENS AVAILABLE FOR A SMARTPHONE AT THE MOMENT!AND THAT TOO ITS NON PENTILE. MANY PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING BUYING SONY'S NEW FLAGSHIP THE XPERIA Z , IT HAS A FULL HD 1080P SCREEN BUT ITS VIEWING ANGLES ARE NOT THAT GOOD,FASTER WEB BROWSING &AMP; DOWNLOADING, INCREDIBLE 8 MP CAMERA, POP UP BROWSER &AMP; VIDEO PLAYER IS TOO GREAT, LARGE SHINY SCREEN MAKES PEOPLE STARE AT MY SMARTPHONE, MOST CREATIVITY STUFF THE S PEN.HANDWRITING RECOGNITION.. FOR ANY INPUT, I DO NOT EVEN TAKE OUT S-PEN, JUST WRITE WORD WITH MY FINGER AND IT RECOGNIZES TEXT SO WELL FABULOUS  GALAXY NOTE 2 - THE KING OF ALL!!!"
Galaxy Note,5,"THIS IS A GREAT DEVICE FOR THOSE WHO WANT A DO IT ALL DEVICE. HAVE BEEN AN APPLE FANBOY FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT BEGAN QUESTIONING THE NEED FOR A DEVICE WHICH IS EXPENSIVE AND GOOD TO LOOK AT BUT SIMPLY DID NOT EXPAND THE HORIZON FOR 2 YEARS NOW. HERE COMES SAMSUNG ALONG WITH GOOGLES BRAND NEW JELLY BEAN 4.1 (4.2 SOON) OS AND MAKES YOU WONDER - ""GEES WHY CAN'T MY IPHONE DO THIS...?""...
      
      THIS IS THE DEVICE ALONG WITH ITS INSPIRATION - THE GALAXY S3 WHICH PUSH THE LIMITS OF MULTI-TASKING ON A MOBILE SCREEN... SIMPLY A PHENOMENAL DEVICE IF YOU CAN THINK BEYOND THE AESTHETICS AND CLEAN INTERFACES. THIS IS A MULTITASKING POWERHOUSE..."
Galaxy Note,5,"THIS IS A MASTERPIECE FROM SAMSUNG. I NEVER FELT THE SIZE TO BE TOO BIG. S-PEN IS SUPERB AND SO, IS THE MOBILE. U CAN ENJOY MOVIES ON THE GO.
      
      
      THE BEST:
      
      SUPER BATTERY
      
      MULTI TASKING
      
      POP VIDEO PLAYER
      
      SUPER MUSIC PLAYER ...ONE WORD BOOMBOX"
Galaxy Note,5,"THIS PHONE IS A BEAST. FOR GUYS, WHO ARE EVEN USED TO ANDROID, THIS PHONE WILL TAKE SOME TIME FOR YOU TO GET ADJUSTED.
      
      WITH WHOLE LOT OF FEATURES AT ONE GO, A LOOK INTO THE USER MANUAL, WONT BE BAD.
      
      HOWEVER, A BIT BIGGER TO HOLD , CARRY &AMP; USE. BUT THAT CHOICE HAS TO BE MADE WHILE U SEE A LIVE DEMO AT THE STORES ONLY &AMP; NOT COMMENTED AFTER PURCHASING.
      
      ON A WHOLE, FEATURES AND QUALITY IS AWESOME. I FEEL, ONCE YOU PURCHASE THIS, YOU SHOULD NOT FEEL THE NEED FOR ANOTHER PHONE FOR NEXT 2 YEARS.
      
      HOWEVER, PHONES WILL KEEP COMING, WHICH WILL OFFER LUCRATIVE DEALS, BUT MIND YOU, CURRENTLY THIS IS THE LEADER."
Galaxy Note,5,"THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY GOOD AND HANDY SERIOUSLY .IT FEELS LIKE I AM BLESSED WITH SAMSUNG NOTE 2 WITH ITS UNIQUE FEATURES AND SPECIFICATIONS  WHICH MAKES IT TALL APART FROM OTHERS.
      
      INITIALLY I WAS AN I PHONE USER BUT JUMPING INTO AN ANDROID PHONE THAT 2 WITH SAMSUNG NOTE MAKE MY DECISION WORTHY  ENOUGH .IT HAS LOT OF FEATURES TO EXPLORE ON .HOPE IT DOESNT DISAPOINT ME IN THE FUTURE AND ALSO THE BATTERY SYSTEM IS GOOD ENOUGH ACCORDING TO ITS SIZE."
Galaxy Note,5,"TODAY I GOT MY NEW NOTE II AND I LIKE YAHOOOOOOO ,CANT EXPRESS WHAT AMAZING SCREEN CLEARITY , AND GAME PERFORMANCE...DOES HOW THINK NOTE II IS JUST WASTE OF MONEY SO UR MISSING SUGAR IN THE JUICE GUYS."
Galaxy Note,5,"TRULY A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE BUYING THIS DEVICE.
      
      PROS :
      
      GOOD BUILD QUALITY.
      
      BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY.
      
      BLAZING FAST.
      
      S-PEN PROVES TO BE VERY USEFUL.
      
      BEST HAND HELD MEDIA CONSUMPTION DEVICE.
      
      VALUE FOR MONEY.
      
      CONS : VERY HUGE NOT MEANT FOR MEN WITH SMALL FINGERS"
Galaxy Note,5,"USEFUL INTERESTING FEATURES OF GALAXY NOTE 2, RATHER THAN THE COMMON FEATURES
      
      
      FIRST TO MENTION, BEFORE BUYING THIS BEAST: GALAXY NOTE 2, I HAD READ A LOT OF REVIEWS HERE IN FLIPKART ON THIS MOBILE, BUT MAX OF THEM WERE ON THE COMMON FEATURES THAT ALMOST EVERYONE KNOWS FROM LIKE THE:
      
      
      -5.5 SCREEN
      
      -QUAD-CORE
      
      -2GB RAM
      
      -SUPER AMOLED CAPACITIVE TOUCHSCREEN
      
      -16GB INTERNAL
      
      -64GB EXTERNAL EXPANDABLE
      
      -CAMERA: 8MP(MAIN), 1.9(FRONT)
      
      -NFC
      
      -OS: ANDROID JELLY BEAN
      
      -GPU: MAIL-400MP
      
      -STYLUS PEN
      
      
      YES, I AGREE, THESE ARE THE EXCELLENT FEATURES WHICH OTHER PHONES CANNOT COMPETE EASILY,
      
      BUT, THERE ARE LOADS OF OTHER INTERESTING STUFFS THAT ANY TECH SAVY PERSON WILL LIKE A LOT!!!
      
      
      AFTER BUYING THIS GALAXY NOTE 2 LAST WEEK, I HAD BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE EXTRA FEATURES THAT THIS BEAST OFFERS IN EXCESS TO THE MENTIONED ABOVE ONES.
      
      SOME OF THEM ARE AS FOLLOWS:
      
      
      -FIRST OF ALL, THE MOST ATTRACTIVE FEATURE THAT I REALLY LIKED WAS THE MOTION SENSOR CAPABILITIES THAT THIS BEAST IS OFFERING.
      
      LET ME NOTE DOWN SOME OF THEM AS TESTED BY ME:
      
      
      1) TO UNLOCK THE DEVICE WITH MOTION, TAP AND HOLD A POINT ON THE SCREEN, AND THEN TILT THE DEVICE FORWARDS.
      
      2) WHEN YOU PICK UP THE DEVICE AFTER IT HAS BEEN IDLE FOR SOME TIME OR WHEN THE SCREEN HAS TURNED OFF, IT VIBRATES IF YOU HAVE MISSED CALLS OR NEW MESSAGES.
      
      3) WHILE VIEWING A CALL, A MESSAGE, OR CONTACT DETAILS ON THE PHONE SCREEN, SIMPLY PICK UP AND HOLD THE DEVICE TO YOUR EAR TO MAKE A CALL TO THAT NUMBER.
      
      4) TAP AND HOLD AN ITEM ON THE SCREEN, AND THEN MOVE THE DEVICE TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT TO MOVE THE ITEM TO ANOTHER PANEL ON THE HOME SCREEN OR THE APPLICATIONS SCREEN IN THAT DIRECTION.
      
      5) WHEN AN IMAGE IS ZOOMED IN, TAP AND HOLD A POINT ON THE SCREEN, AND THEN MOVE THE DEVICE IN ANY DIRECTION TO BROWSE THE IMAGE.
      
      6) WHILE YOU ARE CHEKING MAILS OR CONTACTS IN A PAGE AND YOU REACH THE MIDDLE OR THE LAST OF THE LIST, SIMPLY DOUBLE-TAP THE DEVICE TO MOVE TO THE TOP OF A LIST OF CONTACTS OR EMAILS.
      
      7) WHILE THE SCREEN IS LOCKED, TAP AND HOLD THE SCREEN, AND THEN ROTATE THE DEVICE TO LANDSCAPE ORIENTATION TO LAUNCH THE CAMERA.
      
      8) TURN OVER THE DEVICE(MAKING IT LIE DOWN WITH BACK-SIDE UP) TO MUTE RINGTONE, PAUSE MEDIA PLAYBACK, OR MUTE THE FM RADIO.
      
      9) SHAKE THE DEVICE TO SEARCH FOR BLUETOOTH DEVICES.
      
      10) SHAKE THE DEVICE TO UPDATE THE LIST OF EMAILS OR INFORMATION FROM YAHOO NEWS, YAHOO FINANCE ETC.
      
      11) SWEEP YOUR HAND SIDEWAYS ACROSS THE SCREEN FROM RIGHT TO LEFT TO CAPTURE A SCREENSHOT.
      
      12) COVER THE SCREEN WITH A PALM TO PAUSE MEDIA PLAYBACK. MOVE IT AWAY FROM THE SCREEN TO RESUME.
      
      13) TAP AND HOLD TWO POINTS ON THE SCREEN, AND THEN TILT THE DEVICE BACK AND FORTH TO ZOOM IN OR OUT.
      
      14) WHEN THE TOUCH SCREEN IS TURNED OFF, MOVE YOUR HAND ACROSS THE PROXIMITY/LIGHT SENSOR TO
      
      TURN ON THE SCREEN LIGHTLY AND VIEW THE NUMBER OF MISSED CALLS AND NEW MESSAGES, THE BATTERY
      
      POWER LEVEL, AND MORE.
      
      
      THE ABOVE ARE THE SPECIAL FEATURES THAT THIS PHONE PROVIDES IN RESPECT TO VARIOUS MOTIONS.
      
      
      - SECONDLY, LIKE THE GALAXY S3, IT HAS THE SMART STAY, WHICH ENABLES THE PHONE TO KEEP THE SCREEN ON AS LONG AS YOU ARE LOOKING AT IT.
      
      WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES OR MOVE AWAY FROM LOOKING INTO THE SCREEN, THE PHONE SCREEN WILL AUTOMATICALLY TURN OFF.
      
      
      - THIRDLY, WITH THE QUAD-CORE PROCESSOR AND 2GB RAM, GAMERS WILL REALLY LOVE THIS PHONE SINCE SOME VERY HIGH RESOLUTION GAMES ARE JUST RUNNING WITH NOT A SINGLE POINT OF LAG IN THIS PHONE.
      
      
      - FOURTHLY, YOU WOULD LUV TO WATCH VIDEOS IN THIS PHONE DUE TO ITZ BIG SCREEN AND THE VERY GOOD QUALITY VIDEOS RUNNING SMOOTHLY.
      
      
      - FIFTHLY, MUSIC QUALITY IS REALLY VERY GOOD AND DESCENT. RADIO WORKS PERFECT.
      
      
      - SIXTHLY, SAR (SPECIFIC ABSORPTION RATE) LEVEL IS RELATIVELY LOW(THE LOWER THE BETTER) FOR THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 IN COMPARISION TO OTHER PHONES:
      
      
      GALAXY NOTE 2: 0.171 W/KG
      
      GALAXY NOTE: 0.39 W/KG
      
      GALAXY S3: 0.342 W/KG
      
      GALAXY S2: 0.338 W/KG
      
      IPHONE 4S: 0.98 W/KG
      
      IPHONE 5: 0.951 W/KG
      
      HTC ONE X: 0.909 W/KG
      
      
      APART FROM THE ABOVE MENTIONED FEATURES:
      
      - I HAVE NOT TESTED WITH THE CAMERA YET SINCE I ALREADY HAVE A DIGITAL CAMERA.
      
      BUT AS READ FROM REVIEWS, THE CAMERA IS QUITE GOOD IN ITS CAPABILITIES, WITH 1.9 FRONT CAMERA IS JUST GREAT.
      
      
      - ALSO NOT TESTED WITH THE FULL CAPABILITY OF THE STYLUS PEN, SINCE IT HAS LOADS OF FUNCTIONALITIES THAT HAS TO BE CHECKED IN DETAILS :-)
      
      
      SO SIMPLY AFTER EXAMINING WITHLOTS OF SUCH EXCITING FEATURES, IT SIMPLY STANDS OUT TALL IN THE MARKET."
Galaxy Note,5,USING THIS DEVICE FROM PAST 1 MONTH. THIS WAS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE AND WITH ALL ITS SPECIFICATION PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG I AM IN CLOUD 9 RIGHT NOW. FLAWLESS UI AND PROCESSOR SPEED. AND LOTS OF NEW FEATURE LIKE AIR VIEW. STILL I AM UNABLE TO UNCOVER ALL ITS FEATURE. ITS BEAST IN SMARTPHONE MARKET. THOUGH SIZE IS 5.5INCHES IT WILL CREATE SOME DIFFICULTIES IN HANDLING BUT I INSIST YOU TO BUY  SAMSUNG'S ORIGINAL FLIP COVER. MAKE SURE THE COVER IS NFC SUPPORTED ONLY THEN IT IS GENUINE. IT WILL COST YOU 1350 RS.
Galaxy Note,5,"VERY GOOD SHIPPING, DID NOT EXPECT WILL RECEIVE IT SO EARLY. KUDOS TO FLIPKART FOR KEEPING UP THEIR STANDARDS.
      
      
      AS FOR THE PHONE, BUY IT TO ADMIRE IT!!!
      
      
      BEFORE BUYING I THOUGHT 5.55' WAS A LITTLE TO BIG BUT ONCE I GOT IT IN MY HAND THE OTHER PHONES LOOKED SMALLER. LOL"
Galaxy Note,5,"VERY PROMPT DELIVERY BY FLIPKART. IT WAS DELIVERY TO ME WITHIN 2 WORKING DAYS AS ADVERTISED ON THIS WEBSITE.
      
      THIS IS THE BEST SMART PHONE I HAVE USED TILL NOW. EXCELLENT FEATURES AND STYLISH LOOKS MAKES IT A PRIZED POSSESION. IT'S WORTH THE MONEY PAID FOR."
Galaxy Note,5,"WELL THERE IS JSUT TWO WAYS ABOUT IT
      
      
      (I) IF YOU CAN HANDLE THE SIZE .. YOU WILL LOVE IT.
      
      
      (II) IF YOU CANT HANDLE THE SIZE... THEN LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE
      
      
      AND OH, YES MIROMAX AND ITS ILK ARE CHEAPER.. BUT THEN IF YOU WANTED THE CANVAS DONT LOOK AT THE NOTE 2 FOR A COMPARE (UNLESS U WANT TO LOOK SILLY). PROBABLY THE GRAND OR THE NEW MEGA MIGHT BE MORE YOU CUP OF TEA."
Galaxy Note,5,"WELL, THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS MONSTER OF A PHONE. IT'S JUST EPIC!!! FOR STARTERS, IT JUST DOES EVERYTHING. YOU CAN'T ASK FOR MORE IN A SMARTPHONE. NOTE TAKING, S-PEN, JELLY BEAN, QUAD CORE, SUPER FAST, AWESOME CAMERA, AMAZING SCREEN, AWESOME WEB BROWSING AND GAMING, BRILLIANT BATTERY LIFE, YOU JUST NAME IT AND THIS BEAST HAS IT. SO IN SHORT IT'S JUST ""NOTABULOUS"". HERE ARE MY PROS AND CONS:
      
      
      ---&GT; PROS:
      
      
      1) AMAZING SCREEN WITH 5.5"" AND SUPER AMOLED NON-PENTILE HD DISPLAY WHICH JUST THROWS LIFE IN EVERYTHING.
      
      2) QUAD CORE CPU WITH JELLY BEAN JUST GETS THE JOB DONE IN SECONDS.
      
      3) S-PEN IS THE BEST THING WHICH JUST TAKES THE EXPERIENCE TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
      
      4) AMAZING FOR WATCHING MOVIES AND PLAYING GAMES.
      
      5) FAST WEB BROWSING AND MAKES READING AN EASE.
      
      6) GOOD FOR OFFICE AS WELL AS PERSONAL USE.
      
      7) ABSOLUTE MAMMOTH BATTERY LIFE.
      
      
      ---&GT; CONS:
      
      
      1) WELL, IT'S NOT SUITABLE FOR SMALL HANDS AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE BIG SCREEN PHONES.
      
      2) AS PPI IS ONLY 267, IT'S NOT SUPER SHARP AS THE S3 BUT STILL CLEAR ENOUGH.
      
      3) SOMETIMES IT LAGS BUT IT ONLY HAPPENS ON SOME RARE OCCASIONS.
      
      4) AS IT'S SUPER AMOLED, SO THE WHITES ARE A LITTLE WARM, HENCE THE COLORS LOOK A LITTLE OVER-SATURATED AND WON'T GIVE IT A NATURAL LOOK. SOME LIKE IT WHILE SOME DON'T LIKE IT BUT OVERALL IT LOOKS AMAZING.
      
      
      SO THOSE WHO HAVE SOME MONEY TO CASH IN THEN THEY CAN DEFINITELY OPT FOR THE NOTE 2. BUT IF YOU CAN WAIT FOR A MONTH OR TWO, THEN YOU'LL BE IN TREAT FOR THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 WHICH IS THE NEXT BEST THING. BUT FOR NOW THE NOTE 2 IS THE BEST OPTION. SO JUST 3 WORDS FOR THIS SUPER-PHONE:
      
      
      ""NOTE2 IS GOD""."
Galaxy Note,5,YOU DONT HAVE TO THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING THIS PRODUCT. ITS THE FASTEST AND THE MOST POWERFUL PHONE IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW WITH A FANTASTIC BATTERY FOR AN ANDROID DEVICE. THE ONLY THING ONE NEEDS TO DECIDE IS IF YOU WANT A PHONE OF THIS SIZE. FOR ME THE BIGGER THE BETTER.
Galaxy Note,4,"AN EXCELLENT PHONE AND TABLET HYBRID WITH A SUPERIOR SCREEN AND SKILL WITH IMPROVED STYLUS, BUT ITS SIZE MAY STILL PUT PEOPLE OFF...
      
      THESE REVIEWS HAS ONLY TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT MAKE THE NOTE 2 SO USEFUL. USEFUL IS A GOOD DESCRIPTION FOR THE NOTE 2 AS IT IS EASILY THE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER USED. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT FOR EVERYONE, WHICH IS TRUE FOR ANY SMARTPHONE, BUT FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR AN INNOVATIVE PHONE IN THE CROWDED ANDROID SPACE THE NOTE 2 IS WORTH A LOOK..."
Galaxy Note,4,"BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A WHILE
      
      AN OVERALL NICE PRODUCT EVEN THOUGH I DIDNT GET IT FROM FLIPKART. GETS MOST OF MY JOBS DONE BUT THE ONL PROBLEM I FACE IS TAKES UP A LOT OF SPACE IN MY JEANS POCKET LITERALLY LEAVING NO PLACE FOR ANYTHING ELS OON THE SAME POCKET
      
      AND ALSO I MUST MENTION THE AMAZING BATTERY LIFE OF THE SUPERPHONE/PHABLET
      
      IT LASTS MORE THAN A DAY ON EXXTENSIVE USE
      
      I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT"
Galaxy Note,4,"BOUGHT THIS BEAUTY 20 DAYS AGO FROM ONLY 1 SPICE OUTLET WHICH OBLIGED 2 EXCHANGE MY NOKIA 5800 N THINK I WAS T ONLY GUY TO GET IT IN EXCHANGE FOR 5800 DON'T KNOW N UNDERSTAND T CRAZY STRATEGIES OF EITHER SAMSUNG OR OTHER RETAILERS DAT WHY CAN'T 5800 B EXCHANGE WHEN NOKIA 5233 WHICH IS HALF T PRICE IS ELIGIBLE FOR EXCHANGE ??????
      
      MY 1ST CHOICE WAS HTC 1 BUT THANK SAMSUNG FOR THAT 10OOO OFF WITH 6 M MONTHS EMI @ 0% INT.
      
      NOW FOR T PRO'S N CON'S.
      
      
      PRO'S
      
      
      1) 2 GB RAM IS AN ASSET GUYS BELIEVE ME.
      
      2) I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF A TOLL FREE CUSTOMER CARE SO HATS OFF 2 SAMSUNG FOR GIVING ME A TOLL FREE CUSTOMER CARE.
      
      3) MY SET CAME PRE LOADED WITH 4.1.2 JELLYBEAN SO DON'T KNOW T  PROS N CONS OF 4.1.1
      
      4) MY PHONE WORKS LIKE A DREAM N SMOOTH AS BUTTER BUT CHROME HAS TO GO A LONG WAY IN ORGANISING SHORT CUTS N DESK TOP BOOK  MARKS AS OPERA MINI IS FAR BETTER IN ORGANISING.
      
      5) SOUND IN T EXTERNAL SPEAKER IS VERY GOOD  BECAUSE OF T SIZE ALTHOUGH I COULD SEE ONLY 1 BIG SPEAKER N WAS WONDERING HOW THAT COULD GIVE STEREO EFFECT IN T OPTIONS ? ???
      
      6)INTER FACE IS QUIET GOOD.
      
      7) CAMERA IS SUPERB ALTHOUGH I'M NOT A PHOTO BUFF AS I HAD A GET TOGETHER ON T 2ND DAY OF BUYING THIS PHONE N T BURST MODE OPTION WITH 20 SHOTS IN 10 SECONDS IS EXCELLENT.
      
      8) WATCHING MOVIES N VIDEO MODE IS GOOD AS I FELT THAT IT MATCHED MY 5800 IN SOUND N VIDEO CLARITY WAS MORE IN THIS BY LEAPS N BOUNDS.
      
      9) LAST BUT NOT LEAST GUYS BATTERY BACK UP IS AMAZING AS I INITIALLY BOUGHT AN EXTRA CHARGER FOR MY SHOP ALSO N HAVE HARDLY USED IT AS T BACK UP WAS DECENT IN ANY MODE OF MY OPERATION LIKE GAMING-BROWSING-VIDEO-PHOTOS OR VIDEO MODE.
      
      10) S PEN IS A BONUS GUYS. BELIEVE ME ALTHOUGH I'VE NOT EXPLORED IT STILL MY OFFICE GOING NEPHEW LOVED IT ALTHOUGH HE USES IPHONE.
      
      
      AS FOR T CON'S
      
      
      1) 4 STARS FOR T SIZING AS I'M A SMALL MAN N M HANDS ACHE WHILE USING T MOBILE.HOPE IT STOPS ACHING AFTER A FEW DAYS ?
      
      2) MY PHONE MEMORY SHOWS ONLY 10 GB IN TOTAL N NOT 16 GB AS IN T RECORDS ?????
      
      3) PLS REMEMBER TO UPDATE OS T MOMENT U BUY T  MOBILE AS MY SET HUNG ON DAY 2 WITH 1GB RAM FREE N VERY SIMPLE GAMES N BASIC APPS.
      
      BUT SAMSUNG CUST CARE WAS VERY KIND TO SOLVE T PROB ONLINE ONLY ALTHOUGH I HATED MAGADI ROAD SERVICE CENTRE'S VISIT IN BANGALORE FOR ITS FISH MARKET SCENARIO N MOST HORRIBLE SERVICE N A LOOOOONG QUE.
      
      4) HAVE GIVEN 4 STARS ONLY FOR T SIZE AM UNHAPPY N SILENT PROTESTING SAMSUNG'S DECISION TO LAUNCH 1GB RAM IN INDIAN S3 ALTHOUGH SOUND WOULD'VE BEEN LESS WHEN COMPARED TO NOTE 2
      
      5) LASTLY GUYS BE CAREFUL WHEN USING LIMITED DATA PACKS N KEEP T MOBILE DATA MODE IN OFF MODE IF U R NOT USING T NET ALL DAY AS I HAVE EXHAUSTED MY 2GB 3G DATA IN JUST 12 DAYS AS MOST 50 TO 60 PERCENT HAS GONE FOR UPDATES N WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO STOP SOME APPS UPDATES N SUFFER LATER ?????
      
      6) TRY PUTTING SOME RUBBER EDGED COVER FOR PROTECTING T CORNERS N PHONE FROM SHOCKS N DROPS INSTEAD OF THE REGULAR FLIP COVER AS T GLASS IS A GORILLA GLASS U NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT SCRATCHES.
      
      7) LAST BUT NOT LEAST I PRAY TO GOD N ALL T COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN UNIFORM PRICING STRATEGY'S N NOT GATE CRASHING IN REDUCTION OF PRICES ????"

      A DEVICE FOR BETTER VISUALS AND PERFORMANCE BUT NOT HANDY.
      
      
      SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE II"
Galaxy Note,4,"EXCELLENT VALUE FOR MONEY - IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE LARGER THAN NORMAL SCREEN.  AT RS.25,875/- THINK IT'S REALLY A GOOD BUY.
      
      
      COLOR SATURATION IS SOMETHING NOT SO NATURAL, COMPARED TO S2 AND ALSO MISSING THE MEMO ON GALAXY S2 AND IMPORTING THAT CONTENT INTO NOTE 2,  BUT OTHERWISE, HAVING A GOOD TIME - AS TO ME IT'S MORE A DATA ACCESS DEVICE THAN A PHONE AND IT FITS THAT USE PRETTY WELL."
Galaxy Note,4,"GALAXY NOTE 1 WAS A BIG HIT NO DOUBT, BUT IS IT GOING TO BE THE SAME ? WELL THE PHONE IS SLIGHTLY HEAVIER THEN THE PREDECESSOR AND HAS REALLY LOW PIXEL DENSITY AS COMPARED TO S3 OR NOTE 1. I GUESS ONE SHOULD WAIT FOR PRICES TO GET SLIGHTLY LOWERED AND THIS WILL PROVE OUT TO BE A GREAT BUY. I STILL THINK S3 IS QUIET BETTER AS IT FITS IN HANDS QUIET EASILY AND 4.8 INCH IS REALLY BIG! NOTE 2 HAS A BETTER BATTERY (3000 MAH)BUT I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS ENOUGH FOR SUCH A GIANT MACHINE. WELL I LEAVE IT YOU MY FRIENDS WHETHER YOU WANT TO PURCHASE THIS BEAST OR NOT, I WOULD SUGGEST TO  WAIT FOR PRICES TO GET DROPPED!

Galaxy Note,4,"GOT THE PHONE LAST WEEK FROM SAMSUNG STORE..I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE PRICE OF THIS PHONE ALMOST 2 GRANDS CHEAPER THAN FLIPKART. (ALTHOUGH I STILL LOVE FLIPKART).
      
      
      NOW THE PHONE:
      
      
      MY HANDS ARE NOT SO BIG, AND I AM HAVING NO TROUBLES TO HANDLE THIS PHONE. YES ITS BIGGY, BUT THAT'S THE USP OF THIS PHONE. I GOT USED TO IT WITHIN 2 DAYS. NO PROBLEMS TO KEEP THIS IN POCKET EITHER.
      
      
      THE GIANT SCREEN SIZE MAKES EVERY PHONE AROUND YOU INFERIOR, YES EVEN THE IPHONE LOOKS WAY BACKWARDS IN TIME. IPHONE 5 SURELY IS A GOOD COMPETITOR TO THIS PHONE, BUT AT THE CURRENT PRICE OF NOTE 2, IT'S SIMPLY GIVES YOU LOT MORE THAN ANY IPHONE. FEATURES ARE LOT MORE ESPECIALLY IF YOU CONSIDER S-PEN AND ITS CREATIVENESS.
      
      
      HARDWARE TOO BEATS ANY PHONE IN CURRENT MARKET. THIS WILL SURELY BE A BEST AVAILABLE HARDWARE IN THE MARKET FOR NEXT 2 YEARS.
      
      
      GAMES ARE GOOD, INBUILT APPS ARE FUN TOO.
      
      
      DEDUCTING ONE STAR, AS PRICE WAS STILL A BIT ON A HIGHER SIDE FOR ME."
Galaxy Note,4,"GREATEST PHONE EVER USED BY ME. LOADED WITH POWERFUL QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AND 2GB RAM AND A VERY BIG SCREEN,BATTERY LIFE IS VERY GOOD ITS PERFORMANCE IS VERY SMOOTH AND AS OF NOW ITS A VERY GOOD DEVICE WORTH BUYING."
Galaxy Note,4,"GUD PHONE TO USE.
      
      LONG BATERY LIFE UPTO 18 HRS.
      
      HAVING SOME ANDROID BUGS.
      
      1.I HAVE BEEN USING IT SINCE PAST 20 DAYS, IT GOT AUTOMATICALLY RESTARTED 2 TIMES.
      
      2. AUTOMATIC CALLING FEATURE BUG: IF YOU PUT YOUR PHONE TO YOUR YEARS THIS MAY CALL ANY OTHER NUMBER AS WELL INSTEAD OF CALLING THE PERSON FROM WHOM YOU ARE READING MESSAGE."
Galaxy Note,4,"GUYS THIS PHONE IS AWESOME
      
      BUT 36K FOR A PHONE
      
      YOU CAN BUY A LCD TV , AC ETC .
      
      YOU ALSO CAN INVEST IT IN STOCKS AND SHARES AND ENJOY THE DIVIDEND
      
      TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING DAY BY DAY . TOMMOROW SAMSUNG IS GONNA COME UP WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY S4  APPLE WITH IPHONE 6. THEN YOU MAY FIND THIS PHONE OUTDATED .
      
      WASTE OF 36K
      
      I INSIST THAT BY A PHONE WHICH IS SOMEWHERE WITHIN 15K - 20K AND WILL REMAIN IN THE MARKET AND IS USEFUL .
      
      THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DESIGNERS AND EXECUTIVES OR SOME ONE WHO HAS REAL VALUE . BUT NOT FOR SHOW OFF
      
      
      OVERALL THIS IS AN AWESOME PHONE REALLY SMART BUT THINK TWICE BEFORE SPENDING 36K"
Galaxy Note,4,"HEY GUYS I GOT THIS PHONE FROM NATIONAL MARKET BANGALORE WITH MANUFACTURER WARRANTY AT ONLY 32.5K...AND IT IS THE LEAST PRICE AT WHICH YOU CAN THIS AWESOME DEVICE...AND YOU CAN GET IT FROM SHOPPING.INDIATIMES.COM AT 32.2K....WITH COUPON CODE MOBDEALS...DONT KNOW Y FLIPKART`S PRICE IS SOOOOOOO HIGH....
      
      ABOUT THE DEVICE:
      
      IT IS THE BEST DEVICE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET WITH BEST HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION... AND IT WILL GET THE ANDROID 5.0 KEYLIMEPIE UPDATE ALSO...
      
      
      BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BRING ONE THING TO YOUR NOTICE...THIS DEVICE HEATS UP A LOT AFTER PLAYING GAMES...AND IS USUALLY WARM ON THE UPPER HALF...BOTH FRONT AND BACK...WHILE ON CHARGING OR WHILE USING 3G OR WIFI
      
      SOMETIMES AFTER NORMAL USAGE ALSO U CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UPPER HALF AND THE BOTTOM HALF...AND IS DIFFICULT TO TALK ON A PHONE CALL...
      
      
      BUT TODAY I WENT TO THE SERVICE AND THEY INSTALLED A SOFTWARE PATCH...NOW IT IS WORKING OK...BUT IT STILL GETS WARM...
      
      
      AND I FOUND OUT THAT ALMOST ALL THE NOTE 2 DO GET WARM AFTER NORMAL 15-20 MINS OF USAGE
      
      
      ANYWAYS I WILL SEE IF THE PATCH WORK AND POST A REVIEW AGAIN...
      
      
      HOWEVER THE DEVICE IS FABULOUS...THE EXPERIENCE IS FLAWLESS...NO LAG NOTHING...AND HAS FANTASTIC AND VERY RESPONSIVE TOUCH SCREEN..."
Galaxy Note,4,"HEY I BOUGHT THIS NOTE 2 LAST WEEK AND AFTER A WEEK OF A USE, BELIEVE ME IT IS THE ONLY PHONE THAT HAS SATISFIED ME SO FAR NOW. AS AN ANDROID DEVELOPER YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU EXPECT FROM THE PHONE AND THIS WAS THE ONLY PHONE THAT HAS FULFILLED AND EXCEEDED ALL MY EXPECTATIONS.
      
      
      ONLY ONE THING WHICH I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH WAS SCREEN COLOR. DON'T KNOW WHICH AMOLED PANEL THEY USE AND WHICH COMBINATION OF RGB COLOR THEY USE THAT SCREEN DOESN'T LOOK THAT MUCH BRIGHT. I HAVE AN IPAD3 AND WHEN I COMPARE IT WITH MY NOTE2, IT APPEARS VERY DIM. ELSE EVERYTHING IS SUPER SEXY. LOOKING FOR BEST PERFORMANCE AND STYLE AND ENTERTAINMENT, GO FOR THIS PHONE XX"
Galaxy Note,4,"HEY PEOPLE, I M IN NEED OF SOME GUIDANCE!! IT WOULD B HELPFUL IF ANYONE COULD CLEAR MY DOUBT... I BOUGHT THIS DEVICE TODAY.. IT SAY THERE IS 16 GB MEMORY, BUT WHEN I OPENED THE DEVICE AND STARTED USING IT, THE ACTUAL MEMORY AVAILABLE WAS ONLY 10.36 GB, CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY IS THERE SUCH A DIFFERENCE??"
Galaxy Note,4,"HEY, THERE ITS ABEST PHONE TO BUY IN SAMSUNG'S LIST
      
      ANYONE HAVING RS40000 JUST GO FOR IT. I'D LIKE TO BUY ONE BUT NOT HAVING THAT MUCH NOTES TO BUY A NOTE 2, JUST JOKING HERE'S ITS REVIEW
      
      4.1 JELLY BEAN OS &AMP; UPGRADABLE TO THE LATEST 4.1.2
      
      5.5 INCH SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY WITH 16M COLORS
      
      A BRAND NEW RE-DESIGNED S-PEN"
Galaxy Note,4,"HI , I WAS USING HTC WILDFIRE S PRIOR TO THIS DEVICE AND HAD SOME REAL INTERNAL MEMORY ISSUES. AS A CUSTOMER WE TEND TO BE SMART AND WANT MAXIMUM OUT OF THE MONEY WE PUT INTO SUCH THINGS. TO BE HONEST I ALWAYS THOUGHT SPENDING MORE THAN 10-12 K ON A PHONE WAS A WASTAGE. AS I HAD TO CHANGE MY DEVICE COS THE OLD ONE WAS GETTING ON MY NERVES. I DECIDED TO GO FOR A DECENT SMARTPHONE LIKE HTC , SAMSUNG , MAY ME HIGH END MICROMAX. AS I GOT A DECENT EXCHANGE OFFER FOR MY OLD DEVICE I PUSHED MY LIMITS AND BOUGHT THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2. I AM A CONTENT BUYER :)
      
      
      PROS FOR THE DEVICE
      
      
      1. BATTERY BACKUP (3100 MAH) IS REALLY GOOD UNLIKE A SMARTPHONE (RUNS 1.25 DAYS OR MAY BE MORE)
      
      2. CURRENTLY RUNNING 88 APPS INCLUDING HEAVY GAMES AND STILL LEFT WITH AMPLE MEMORY TO DOUBLE MY APP COUNT.
      
      3. S PEN IS REALLY COOL !!
      
      4. NOT TO MENTION TECH SPECS : I GUESS YOU KNOW IT ALL BY NOW.
      
      5. LARGE SCREEN SIZE AND DISPLAY. TRUST ME I HAVENT USED MY IPAD SINCE THEN :)
      
      6. DECENT CAMERA AND AMAZING PICTURE QUALITY. BEST BUDDY FOR TRAVEL.
      
      
      CONS (WORK IT OUT):
      
      
      1. THE EARPHONES THEY PROVIDE HAVE A GOOD SOUND QUALITY BUT LOW OUTPUT. YOU PROBABLY HAVE THE GOOD ONES ALREADY.
      
      2. HAVENT TRIED MOVING APPS TO SD , I GUESS ITS SOMEWHAT NOT POSSIBLE.WORKABLE COS, 16 GB IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR APPS AND YOU CAN GET 64GB FOR OTHER STUFF LIKE MUSIC, VIDEOS AND PHOTOS.
      
      3.
      
      
      I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO GO FOR THIS DEVICE IF YOU ARE READY TO SPEND 20K OR MORE COS OTHER SAMSUNG MOBILES IN THIS RANGE REALLY SUCK !! (GRAND, GRAND QUATTRO, MEGA(VERY LOW PPI AND STUPID SCREEN SIZE))"
Galaxy Note,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR 35.5K.WHAT KILLS THIS PHONE IS LACK OF S PEN RELATED APPS.BATTERY BACKUP IS NICE.I WOULD SAY THAT IF U REALLY LOVE GADGETS GO FOR IT.IF YOU DONT PREFER A TILE IN YOUR HAND,DONT GO FOR IT"
Galaxy Note,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE WITH LOTS OF APPREHENSIONS WRT TO SAMSUNG BEING A NOT SO TALKED ABOUT BRAND FOR INDIAN MOBILE MARKET CONDITIONS UNTIL IT JOINED WITH GOOGLE FOR ANDROID . I HAVE BEEN USING NOKIA FOR AGES.
      
      
      I AM REALLY IMPRESSED WITH FEATURES WHILE I HAVE TO CONGREGATE AND SPEND MORE TIME TO KNOW THIS MACHINE FULLY.THIS IS TRULY A BEAST WITH AMOUNT OF WORK LOAD IT TAKES WHILE MULTITASKING.
      
      
      A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT THE EMI OFFER NEGATES THE SAME.
      
      
      THANKS TO FLIPKART ON THIS TIMELY DELIVERY, JUST A FEEDBACK KINDLY REQUEST YOUR DELIVERY PERSON TO ENSURE THAT IT IS DELIVERED SOMEBODY AT HOME AND NOT TO THE WATCHMEN OR SECURITY WHICH WAS THIS CASE. I THINK IT DESERVES MORE RESPECT FOR THE VALUE IT HAS."
Galaxy Note,4,"I HAVE USED SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 AND GOOGLE NEXUS 4 IN THE PAST AND DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING THIS AND TRUST ME THIS IS THE BEST PHONE AVAILABLE TILL DATE. IT TRUE THAT ITS A BIT BIGGER COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES AVAILABLE BUT ITS NOT BULKY. HAS A BIG SCREEN AND S PEN. BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY GOOD.
      
      
      CHOOSE THE ""TITANIUM GREY"" MODEL OVER ""WHITE"" BECAUSE DARK COLOR FEELS SMALLER THAN WHITE.
      
      
      AND IF YOU TALK ABOUT FLIPKART SERVICE .... ITS AWESOME .... ORDERED IT ON SATURDAY NIGHT 10PM AND PHONE WAS DELIVERED ON MONDAY 11AM .... I HAVE BEEN USING FLIPKART FOR A WHILE NOW AND LOOKS LIKE HAVE STARTED COMPROMISING ON THE PACKAGING PART. IN THE PAST THEY WERE SENDING PACKAGES IN BUBBLE BAGS TO AVOID ANY MISHANDLING AND NOW JUST A PLAIN CARDBOARD BOX WITH SAMSUNG BOX INSIDE IT .... PLEASE USE BEST PACKAGING FOR AT-LEAST ELECTRONICS GOOD THAT ARE EXPENSIVE ...."
Galaxy Note,4,"I LOVE IT AND I WANT TO BUY IT. BUT IN INDIA IT IS NOT COMING WITH 4G AND NFC. 4G I CAN UNDERSTAND BUT WHY NOT WITH NFC. SAMSUNG INDIA SITE DOSENT MENTION NFC IN SPECIFICATION LIST.
      
      THEY ARE PROVIDING OLDER FIRMWARE TO INDIANS, THE ONE WHICH DOSENT HAV THE FUNCTION OF SPLIT SCREEN MULTITASKING.
      
      PLEASE SAMSUNG WE LOVE YOU &AMP; U SHOULD LOVE US BACK!!"
Galaxy Note,4,"I PREFERRED OVER HTC ONE X - WE CAN ATTACH MICRO-SD , BATTERY CAN BE REPLACED.
      
      I PREFERRED OVER GALAXY S III - S PEN, REAL ESTATE , @ GB RAM AND QUAD CORE.
      
      
      USING PHONE IS A BREEZE TO USE. WISH TO BOUGHT FROM FLIP-KART BUT THEY DO NOT SELL INSURANCE AND EXTENDED WARRANTY."
Galaxy Note,4,IN THE BUSINESS FEATURE LIST IT IS MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A DOCUMENT EDITOR. HOWEVER THERE IS NO DOCUMENT EDITOR COMES WITH THIS PHONE. NEED TO BUY ONE. OR AT LEAST I'VE NOT FOUND ONE SO FAR USING THE PHONE FOR 3 DAYS.
Galaxy Note,4,"ITS A VERY VERY NICE DEVICE...ALL OPTIONS ARE AMAZING.......REALLY I PROUD TO BY A SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 N7100,RAM SPEED IS WELL.....PROCESSOR ALSO GOOD..............INTERNET BROWSING PERFORMANCE IS NICE........."
Galaxy Note,4,"JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT 2 DAYS AGO
      
      BLV ME ITS A GODLY THING
      
      BATTERY BACK UP IS JUST AWSOME
      
      NET SPEED IS TOO GOOD
      
      I CAN SAY""ITZ NOT A PHONE, ITZ NOT A TABLET,ITZ A ITZ A FANTASTIC COMBINATION OF BOTH"".
      
      LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST GAMING XPRNCE IS JUST GREAT."
Galaxy Note,4,"ONE BUG IN SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE II - IT KEEPS ON BEEPING CONTINUOUSLY DURING A CALL AS THOUGH THERE IS ANOTHER INCOMING CALL :( .. THE WORST PART IS IT CONTINUES TO BEEP EVEN AFTER THE CALL.... THIS IS SO ANNOYING... THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT OF THIS ANNOYING SOUND IS TO RESTART THE PHONE... :(
      
      
      EXCEPT THIS ONE PROBLEM... THE PHONE IS ULTIMATE PHONE..."
Galaxy Note,4,"OVERALL A GOOD PHONE. HOWEVER, PRICE IS VERY VERY HIGH. WITH 40K YOU CAN DO LOTS OF THINGS. :P:P
      
      
      LIKE:
      
      1. PLAN A TRAVEL TOUR WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY
      
      2. CAN BUY A BIKE.
      
      3. CAN BUY A CAR ON EMI'S.
      
      4. DONATE THAT MONEY TO THE NEEDY ONE AND BUY A CHEAPER PHONE INSTEAD.
      
      5. BUY A HD LED TV.
      
      6. BUY AN AC.
      
      
      SO ITS UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU GONNA WASTE THAT 40K FOR JUST A PHONE WITH WHICH YOU GET BORE SOME IN A FEW MONTHS OR DO THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED ABOVE."
Galaxy Note,4,"PRETTY GOOD BUT GALAXY NOTE IS FAR FAR FAR BETTER THAN NOTE 2
      
      IT'S USELESS TO WASTE 10000 FOR NOTE 2,COZ IT DON'T GIVE AS MUCH FACILITIES IN COMPARISON WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE

Galaxy Note,4,"PROS:
      
      1) BIG SCREEN HENCE WATCHING MOVIES IS A TREAT
      
      2) VERY FAST BUT CAN'T COMPARE IT TO THE IPHONE 5 IN TERMS OF SPEED
      
      3) LOTS OF FEATURES AND APPS AVAILABLE IN GOOGLE PLAY
      
      4) BATTERY LIFE (LASTS ME 2 DAYS ON 3G,30 MINUTES OF WEB SURFING, 3 EMAIL ACCOUNTS WITH CLOSE TO 300 MAILS PER DAY, BLUETOOTH, GPS N ALL)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) CAMERA, DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST TO THE SURROUNDINGS, HENCE HAVE TO DO IT MANUALLY, FOR INDOORS AND LOW VISIBILITY.
      
      2) SCREEN GOES BLANK AFTER THE SET SCREEN TIMEOUT WHEN VIEWING FLASH VIDEOS IN FULL SCREEN.

Galaxy Note,4,"SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 PRICE ON FLIPKART AS ON 12TH MARCH 2013 WAS RS 35500/- (TILL 7 PM)
      
      PRICE OF SAME PRODUCT AT 8.30 PM IS RS 37250/-......WHAT IS FLIPKART UP TO? .....WHEN SAME PHONE IS AVAILABLE FOR 34K IN ALMOST ALL OTHER STORES IN THE MARKET.....I WILL NOW BUY FROM OTHER RETAILERS IN MUMBAI RATHER THAN PAYING MORE FOR USING THE ECOMMERCE FACILITY......I WAS LIKING FLIPKART SERVICE BUT THIS IS WHAT I SAW NOW......SORRY FLIPKART...BE WISE...:(....PRODUCT GETS 4 STARS....:)
      
      NISCHAL SHARMA &GT;&GT; U NEED NOT GIVE A COMEBACK FROM FLIPKARTS SIDE......WHY TO BUY FROM SAMSUNGS OFFICIAL STORE...MANY OTHER STORES ALSO PROVIDE GENUINE PRODUCTS AT 3K LESSER...."
Galaxy Note,4,SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2.....HMMMM...WELL ITS JUST AN AWESOME PHONE......IF UR THINKING OF COMPARING IT WITH S4 LIKE I DID BEFORE BUYING.....YES THINK FOR A WHILE.....THOUGH SAMSUNG SAYS THAT THE S4 HAS AN OCTA-CORE PROCESSOR IT LAGS....OVERALL PERFORMANCE IS THE SAME AS NOTE 2.....THE S4 BEATS NOTE 2 ONN ONLY ONE SINGLE TASK...THAT IS PHOTOGRAPHY.....REST ITS ALL THE SAME.......I'D RECOMMEND U NOTE 2 IF UR LOOKING FOR A LARGE DISLAY AND THE S-PEN.....OR ELSE GO FOR S4....BUT IF U STILL WANT MORE..... WAIT FOR A WHILE......CAUSE NOTE 3 WILL GET LAUNCHED SOON.....CIAO
Galaxy Note,4,"THIS IS A GREAT PHONE TO HAVE, WITH VERY HIGH END SPECIFICATIONS, BUT THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THIS PHONE IS ITS SIZE, I AM QUITE SURE PEOPLE WITH BIG HANDS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT, BUT THE SCREEN SIZE IS THE SAME SIZE AS MY HANDS, EVEN WITH A STYLUS IT WILL LOOK LIKE A TABLET IN MY HANDS THAT I'D RATHER NOT LIKE PEOPLE STARING AT ME CARRYING IT. BUT THOSE WHO LOVE THIS PHONE SHOULD BUY IT, IT COMES WITH A STYLUS TOO. I AM A XPERIA FAN, BUT I HAVE TO SAY WELL DONE SAMSUNG WITH SUCH TECH."
Galaxy Note,4,"THIS PHONE HAS EVERYTHING THST YOU HAVE EVER WISHED FOR, AND YOU ARE OCCUPIED FOR THE NEXT 1 YEAR TOO... AS THE FEATURES ARE FAR MORE ADVANCED THAT YOU WONT FEEL OUTDATED TILL SUMMER 2014.
      
      HANDLING IS A BIT OF PROBLEM, I HAVE DROPPED IT SEVERAL TIMES EVEN WITH MY BEAST HANDS, SO IF U HAVE KITTEN PAWS... THINK THRICE BEFORE BUYING.
      
      S-PEN IS BLESSING AND ITS HUMUNGOUS SCREEN SIZE WITH 267 PPI GIVES YOU A VERY GOOD FEEL. THOUGH SOME OF YOU MAY FIND A BIT PROBLEM OF WHITE FLASH LINE OCCURING DURING SCREEN UNLOCK( THAT CAN BE IGNORED.. BUT ITS ANNOYING), BUT IT CAN BE DEALT WITH.
      
      
      THIS IS A TIMELESS PHONE .. YOU BUY IT TODAY AND BE UPDATED TILL SUMMERS 2014, AS IT WILL SURELY SURPASS IPHONE 5S OR 6 FOR SURE( IF TIM COOK'S APPLE DID THE JOB THEY DID WITH IPHONE 5).
      
      
      WORTH A BUY, AS THEIR IS NO MARKET COMPETITOR FOR THIS PHABLET !!!"
Galaxy Note,4,"THOUGH THEY ARE FULLY JUSTIFIED TO DO SO!
      
      - IT IS NOT MORALLY CORRECT ON THE PART OF SAMSUNG TO WITHDRAW THE 15% CASH BACK OFFER WITHOUT ADEQUATE WARNING
      
      - THEY COULD AT LEAST HAVE FLASHED A BANNER GIVING THE LAST DATE
      
      - WELL I WILL NOT BUY IT WITHOUT THE OFFER !! CHEERS"
Galaxy Note,4,"WELL HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR 3 MONTHS NOW AND I MUST ADMIT ITS A GREAT DEVICE RATHER THE BEST SAMSUNG FLAGSHIP DEVICE EVER THOUGH MY USB PORT GOT BAD BUT THOUGH GOT IT FIXED AT THE SERVICE POINT.
      
      THE ONLY THING THAT REMAINS UNDONE IS THE UPDATE TO 4.2.2 UNTIL SAMSUNG RELEASE IT WITH THE S4 FEATURES.
      
      
      JUST BUY IT !!
      
      ONE STAR LESS DUE TO BAD USB"
Galaxy Note,4,"YOU GUYS HAVE GONE BLIND. THESE SMARTPHONES ARE NOT AT ALL USEFUL .
      
      WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER YOU BUY THIS PHONE ? YOU'RE GONNA PLAY FOR A WEEK WITH ITS AWESOME FEATURES,TRY SOME GAMES ETC ETC.
      
      
      AND SOON SAMSUNG RELEASES A GALAXY S4 WHICH WILL BE EVEN MORE AWESOME THAN THIS PHONE.
      
      AND SOON,APPLE,NOKIA AND THEY KEEP COMING AND YOU WILL FEEL THIS PHONE WILL SUCK. AND THESE PROCESSORS WILL STOP WORKING IN A FEW MONTHS. THEY EVEN LAG.
      
      
      SO,GO FOR A PHONE WHICH IS AROUND 10-15K WHICH NEVER CHANGE. YOU WILL BE SATISFIED .
      
      
      36K FOR A MOBILE ? ARE YOU KIDDING ME ? SERIOUSLY YOU CAN BUY A BIKE OR A CAR IN EMI.
      
      
      YOU CAN BUY A HD TV , AC .
      
      AND MORE USEFUL,THE MONEY YOU PUT IN HERE WILL BE ENOUGH FOR YOUR COLLEGE FEE FOR AN YEAR.
      
      
      AND IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY AND YOU DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO,DONATE THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT DONT BUY THESE PHONES ."
Galaxy Note,4,"YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THIS DEVICE BY MTP STORAGE ONLY. MASS STORAGE IS NOT AVAILABLE, WHICH RESULTS IN LOW TRANSFER SPEED. AND YOU CANNOT CONNECT THIS DEVICE TO A MACBOOK. REST ALL THINGS YOU CAN READ FROM OTHER REVIEWS."
Galaxy Note,4,"YOU MUST BE KNOWING ALL THE SPECIFICATIONS OR YU CAN CHECK IN OTHER REVIEWS OR GOOGLE THEM..AS ITS A REVIEW SECTION I WOULD LIKE TO REVIEW MY EXPERIENCE...
      
      I BOUGHT IT ON 13TH OCTOBER'S AFTERNOON..AT RS.37,200 (SO NOT FROM FLIPKART)..!!
      
      SEE THE PHONE IS NO DOUBT FASCINATING AND YU FEEL GOOD HOLDING IT..AND THE FACT IS IT IS REALLY ONE GOOD PHONE..ITS FAST ..HD DISPLAY..COLOURS ARE BETTER THAN EARLIER SAMSUNG PHONES..AND ALMOST EVERY FEATURE YU R LOOKING FOR..ITS LIKE THE MOUNTAIN TOP OF PHONES TODAY..THERE CANT BE MORE THINGS WHICH CAN BE BUNDLED INTO IT..
      
      THE ONLY DRAWBACK WHICH I FELT AND EVERYONE AROUND ME MENTIONED WAS ITS ENORMOUS SIZE!! ITS REALLY BIG AND IT WEIGHS 183 GMS..ITS NOT FOR A GIRLS HAND ..OR MEN WITH SMALL HANDS..
      
      ITS SLIM BUT NOT COMFORTABLE TO HOLD FOR LONG..LIKE I WAS KEEPING THE PHONE DOWN AFTER AROUND 5 MINS..ITS LIKE YU R HOLDING A CERAMIC TILE ..
      
      THIRDLY TALKING ABOUT THE S PEN OR THE STYLUS ITS A GOOD ADD ON..AS AN EG..IF YU R TALKING TO SOME ONE AND NEED TO NOTE DOWN SOMETHING SO AS SOON YU TAKE OUT UR STYLUS ..A NOTE PAD POPS UP..WHERE YU CAN PUT DOWN NOTES..
      
      FOURTHLY IT USES A MICRO SIM SO BUYING FROM SUCH WEBSITES IS A VIABLE OPTION ONLY IF YU HAVE A MICRO SIM ALREADY OR CAN GET IT PUNCHED AROUND UR PLACE..
      
      FINALLY..TALKING ABOUT THE BASIS OF MY REVIEW .. I PREVIOUSLY OWNED AN XPERIA ARC..OF MY THREE CLOSE FRIENDS  ONE OWNS AN HTC ONE X AND ANOTHER S3 AND LAST ONE THE GALAXY S2..IF YU CAN HOLD AROUND 200 GMS OF WEIGHT AND MAKE CALLS THEN THERES NOTHING LIKE IT..ELSE GO FOR S3 OR HTC ONE X.OR EVEN S2...THEY R EQUALLY GOOD OPTIONS ..I JUST DEDUCT A STAR FOR ITS SIZE AND WEIGHT.."
Galaxy Note,3,"FUNCTIONWISE, THIS PHONE LEAVES NO DESIRES. IT OFFERS ALL IMPORTANT AND UNIMPORTANT FEATURES. THE DISPLAY IS GOOD. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS ITS SIZE. THIS IS MORE TABLET THAN A PHONE. IT IS NOT VERY HANDY."
Galaxy Note,3,"GUYS,
      
      
      IF YOU SEE SAMSUNG'S TACTIC IN INDIA THEY MAKE CELL PHONE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR YOU CAN SEE SO MUCH OFFERS AND DISCOUNTS ON THE ITEM AS THEY WILL BE PLANNING TO LUNCH A NEW PHONE AGAIN.
      
      
      IF YOU COMPARE THE SAMSUNG S4 PRICE IN US TO INDIA ITS SO MUCH DIFFERENCE IN PRICE THERE.AND WITHING 2 MONTHS ONLY S4 HAS DECREASED ITS PRICE BY 2000/-.SOME RUBBISH GOING ON.
      
      
      IMAGINE THE SAMSUNG S3 PRICE WHEN IT WAS LUNCHED IN INDIA IT WAS AROUND 38K.
      
      ON PRESENT DAY YOU CAN GET IT AT 27K.
      
      11K DIFFERENCE,YOU CAN'T RECHAGE TALKTIME OF 11L IN 1-1.5 YEARS.
      
      THEY ARE CHEATERS ONLY."
Galaxy Note,3,"I'M A FIRST TIME USER OF ANDROID AND SAMSUNG DEVICES.  I MUST SAY THAT I'M HAPPY WITH THE DEVICE SO FAR.  DEVICE IS PRETTY SNAPPY, THANKS TO GOOD HARDWARE SPECS AND JELLYBEAN.
      
      
      WHAT I LIKE:
      
      - DEVICE IS PRETTY SNAPPY
      
      - CUSTOMISATIONS ( I DID TONS OF CUSTOMISATIONS USING TASKER AND OTHER APPS).
      
      - GOOGLE INTEGRATION
      
      - HANDWRITING
      
      - LARGE SCREEN
      
      
      WHAT I DON'T LIKE:
      
      - DEFAULT ANDROID PHONE APP.  THIS IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN.  YOU DON'T GET A CONCISE VIEW OF PHONE LOGS, SMS APP UI IS VERY MEDIOCRE).  ALL THAT YOU CAN SEE IS ONE LINE WHEN YOU START REPLYING TO A MAIL THOUGH YOU HAVE SUCH A BIG SCREEN)
      
      
      I DON'T LIKE MOST:
      
      - POWER BUTTONS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DEVICE.  YOU ""ACCIDENTALLY"" RESTART THE DEVICE 2-3 TIMES MINIMUM WHILE HOLDING THE PHONE.
      
      - VOLUME BUTTONS ON THE LEFT.  YOU CAN HARDLY ACCESS THEM IF YOU REPLACE THE BACK COVER WITH THE FLIP COVER.
      
      - NO MUTE BUTTON.  ITS HARD TO PRESS THE TOUCH SCREEN EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO MUTE THE LINE."
Galaxy Note,3,"NICE TO HANDLE AND NAVIGATE WITH BUT GOT A SCRATCH IN A SPACE OF THREE DAYS. VERY FLIMSY BODY. SAMSUNG IS A KOREAN COMPANY AND JUST LIKE ALL KOREAN PRODUCTS -- CARS, INDUSTRIAL PLANTS AND PHONES -- THIS ONE IS TRUE TO THEIR MANUFACTURING STYLE. IT IS BEING SOLD IN MANY NUMBERS WITH LOTS OF ADVERTISING BUT THE BODY DOES NOT PROMISE DURABILITY. IN FACT, THE CUSTOMER IS ALSO NOT HOPING FOR A LONG LASTING PRODUCT. SO, I THINK THE MANUFACTURER AND CUSTOMER ARE EVEN."
Galaxy Note,3,"NO REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY/PERFORMANCE. THERE IS ALWAYS A LAG IN THE DISPLAY. I USED TO BUY SONY ERRICSON AND HPLC PHONES. SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE HAS ONLY HIGHER SPECIFICATION. IN TERMS OF USER FRIENDLINESS, I THINK SONY PHONES ARE MUCH BETTER.
      
      IT IS AN OK PHONE. NOT WORTH THE PRICE."
Galaxy Note,3,PLEASE DONT WASTE SUCH A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS PHONE ...OVERALL THE PHONE IS GOOD..I USED IT FOR A MONTH AND GOT RID OF IT..VERY BIG PHONE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE WISE ITS GOOD BUT THEN ITS NOT THAT PRACTICAL AND PRICE IS TOO HIGH..SAMSUNG IS JUST A STEP BETTER THAN CHINESE PHONES..BUILD QUALITY IS VERY POOR..SLIPPERY GLOSSY AND BIG SIZE VERY HARD TO CARRY I DROPPED IT THRICE IN ONE MONTH THANKFULLY DIDNT BREAK AND I SOLD IT FOR 30 K ..GO FOR MICROMAX CANVAS INSTEAD AND SAVE MONEY BUY A HD TV INSTEAD ..I WILL NEVER BUY A SAMSUNG PHONE NOT UNTIL THEY START SPENDING MORE ON RESEARCH AND LESS ON PUBLICITY!!!!

      THE FIRST SMARTPHONE TO HAVE 2 GB MEMORY.

      WHEN BUYING PHONE IN FLIPKART WE HAVE TO CHECK THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE BECAUSE
      
      SOME NEW SMART PHONE PRICE INCREASE BY 2K OR 3K,SOME MAY HAVE LOWER PRICE
      
      
      IN THE MARKET THE PRICE OF MOBILE CHANGE DAILY DEPENDING ON MARKET DEMAND BUT
      
      FLIPKART ONLY UPDATE THIER PRICE ONCE IN A MONTH

Galaxy Note,2,"I AM NOT A SAMSUNG HATER OR AN APPLE HATER AS MY PARENTS OWN A IPHONE 5 AND S3, AND I HAVE A IPOD TOUCH 5 AS I'M JUST 14, BUT YOUR REVIEW WAS  COMPLETELY BIASED AND POINTLESS AND WRONG.
      
      
      YOU SAID:
      
      
      GOD HAS A NEW NAME - NOTE-2
      
      MISTRIO'FAB ""DAY COUNTING"", NO SHIT,STRAIGHT TO D POINT :D
      
      
      MEGA PRO'S :-
      
      1) GIGANTIC PROCESSOR 1.6 QUAD (APPLE 5 :- 1GHZ DUAL N SLOW AS GRAND PA)
      
      
      ME: IPHONE 5 HAS AN A6 (1 GHZ DUAL CORE) BUT IT IS IOS OPTIMISED SO IT GIVES A MUCH MORE FLUIDIC PERFORMANCE THAN EVEN 1.6 QUAD CORE.
      
      
      2) 2 GIG RAM TO KILL ANY APP MADE ON THIS EARTH OR OTHER DIMENSION OR EVEN BY GOD HIMSELF .(APPLE 5 :- STILL WID 1 GIG N LAGS BEHIND BENCHMARK)
      
      
      ME: APPLE HAS APPS (MUCH MORE THAN ANDROID APP STORE) SPECIALLY MADE FOR IT SO IT CAN HANDLE ANY APP FROM ITUNES EASILY.
      
      
      3)MALI 400 CAN RUN ANY GRAPHIC INTENSIVE APP LIKE BUTTER, WID NO HANG OR LAG OR STUCK OR WHATSOEVER LIKE IN APPLE.
      
      
      ME: PLAY FIFA 13, OOPS ANDROID DOESN'T HAVE IT YET, SO GO PLAY FIFA 12. YOU'LL OPEN YOUR EYES TO AN APPLE WONDER.
      
      
      4)S-VOICE ,CAN DO WHATEVER U COMMAND, WEATHER/CALL/TEXT/ALARM/MEETING ETC. NO LIMIT.
      
      
      ME: SIRI, MUCH AHEAD THAN S-VOICE, THOUGH S-VOICE IS KILLER TOO.
      
      
      5)S-PEN ,STILL D KING;STILL INCOMPARABLE. WID AIR VIEW ,10 YRS AHEAD OF SO CALLED APPLE.
      
      
      ME: IPHONE'S SCREEN IS SO EASY TO HANDLE THAT YOUR THUMB CAN DO WONDERS.
      
      
      6)BATTERY :- IT LASTS FOR 3-4 DAYS IF U JUST USES IT FOR CALL ON WCDMA/GSM . PLAYING GAMES IS IN UR LIST THEN IT WOULD LAST FOR A DAY.
      
      
      ME: YOUR ON THE SPOT WITH THAT THOUGH IPHONE HAS THE SAME CALL.
      
      
      CONS :-
      
      
      1) STILL LOOKING FOR CON'S ,SORRY BUT THERE ISN'T ANY.
      
      
      ME: SIZE, FOR SOME IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO HOLD.
      
      SCREEN, SAMSUNG STILL HAS TO IMPROVE A LOT ON THE SCREEN RESOLUTION AND PIXEL DENSITY.
      
      
      VERDICT :-
      
      
      WHEN YOU BUY A LAMBORGHINI U DON'T SEE HOW MUCH GAS IT COST U ,HOW D LONG IT WILL GIVE U MILEAGE OR WHATSOEVER. YOU BUY IT FOR SPEED &GT; PASSION &GT; MADNESS &GT; STATUS. THE SAME APPLIES IN NOTE:-2 ,IF U GAT 40 GRAND IN UR POCKET N STILL LOOKING TO BUY AN ANOTHER SHIT OF APPLE AS A5 OR OTHER, THEN MY FRIEND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE FREE ADVICE ""GALAXY NOTE -2 IS A PERFORMANCE ORIENTED WID FUTURISTIC APPS WID MASSIVE 5.5 INCH SCREEN, WHERE APPLE SELL ON ONLY HYPE WID GRAND PA IOS, TINY SCREEN,CRAPPY BATTERY LIFE WID NO OPEN SOURCE.
      
      
      ME: IPHONE IS SO GOOD YOU WON'T MISS OPEN SOURCE AND YOU'LL OBVIOUSLY LOOK MUCH BETTER CARRYING IPHONE TO YOUR OFFICE RATHER A PHONE MADE FOR THE YOUNG.
      
      
      OVERALL,
      
      NOTE 2 IS AN ABSOLUTE BUY BUT IF YOU ARE OFFICE GOING OR LIKE YOUR PHONE TO BE UPDATE OR AS A STATUS SYMBOL, GO FOR IPHONE."
Galaxy Note,2,I'VE USED NOTE 2.N MY DAD LIKED IT SO I GIFTED HIM IDENTICAL MAGICON M NOTE [10   K].N I MUST SAY BOTH R AMAZING.BUT IF 1 NEED JUST TO SHOW OFF THEN DONT WASTE 36 K FOR NOTE 2! GO 4 IDENTICAL N CHEAPER N NON ADVERTISED PHONES.SAMSUNG IS GETTING MILLIONS BY THIS 1 BUT ITS NOT WORTH 36K MAN!WE CAN BUY A LAPTOP IN THIS PRICE!!!
Galaxy Note,1,"@ANUP KUMAR,
      
      IT IS UNFAIR TO COMPARE IPHONE 4/5 WITH SAMSUNG BECAUSE SAMSUNG LOOSE BIG TIME. DON'T GO BT THE SPECS ALONG. I PHONE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO LAST WORLD WAR 3 BUT THE SAMSUNG, I AM AFRAID, CANT BE EXPECTED TO DO SO. DROP THE SAMSUNG "
Galaxy Note,1,"ACCORDING TO ME A PRODUCT'S MAIN ASPECT IS ITS DESIGN AND THIS IS THEDEPARTMENT WHERE SAMSUNG LAGS BEHIND.THE BASIC DIIFERENCE IN TERMS OF APPEARENCE B/W GRAND ,S3 AND NOTE 2,AND COMING S4 IS THE SCREEN SIZE.OTHERWISE THEY ALL LOOK SAME.A COSTLY PRODUCT WITH CHEAP PLASTICS..IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE SAMSUNG IS GOOD BUT IF A PRODUCT IS NOT GOOD FROM OUTSIDE THEN WHY LOOK FOR INSIDE..
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      VERY POOR DESIGN
      
      VERY LARGE DISPLAY.
      
      DOESN'T APPEAL AS AN EXPENSIVE PHONE.."
Galaxy Note,1,"GUYS THIS IS FALSE MARKETING BY NOTE 2 IS AVAILABLE FOR 30-32K PROCE ON EBAY AND SNAPDEAL PRICE OF 37K WITH EXCHANGE OFFER IS FALSE ACTUAL DISCOUNT IS OF JUST 3K FOR SELLING UR OLD PHONE ULL GET MORE THAN THAT.PLEASE DONT BUY AND FALL FOR THIS FALSE PROMOTION.

Galaxy Note,1,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE FROM FLIPKART. 3 MONTHS BACK. NOW THE MOBILE HAS PROBLEM WITH VOICE ECHO DURING THE CALL. SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 IS AN EXCELLENT MOBILE, NO DOUBT ON IT. BUT I GOT A CRAP PIECE FROM FLIPKART. EARLIER I MADE A REVIEW AGAINST FLIPKART. FOR NOTE 2. SO THEY DELETED THE REVIEW WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE . DON'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE POSTIVE COMMENTS EVERYWHERE IN FLIPKART. BECAUSE THEY WILL DELETE THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS AND KEEP THE POSTIVE COMMENTS ALONE, BE AWARE."
Galaxy Note,1,I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND WITHIN TWO WEEKS THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE LCD . I WENT TO THE SERVICE CENTER BUT ITS NOT FIXED TILL NOW(ITS BEEN IN THE SERVICE CENTER FOR A MONTH NOW). SO I WOULD RECOMMEND TO DECIDE WISELY BEFORE SELECTING THIS PHONE. BECAUSE IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY LIKE ME YOU WILL END UP SPENDING BIG BUCKS AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM SAMSUNG.
Galaxy Note,1,"I GOT IT FROM A SAMSUNG RETAILER . 2 PEICES FOR ME AND MY FRIEND . MY PHONE HANGS OFTEN AND COMES IN BOX WITH ANDROID V4.0 ICS AND TOUCHWIZ MAKES THE EXPERIENCE EVEN POOR. LOOKS LIKE USING A S DUOS . IT IS JUST TOO BIG AS A PHONE AN COMES WIT GREAT SPECIFICATIONS AN MAMMOTH BATTERY . I WOULD SUGGEST TO GO FOR AN IPHONE 4S OR 5 . ATLEAST YOU GET GOOD PHONE , GREAT APPS AND GOOD SPECIFICATIONS AND NOR A PLASTIC TOY WITH PROCESSOR AND SPEED . NOW A NEW CASE ARRIVES THE TOUCH RESPONDS AFTER 3 SECONDS . TOLD SAMSUNG . THEY SAY NOTHING CAN BE DONE . THEY WANT AN ADDITITIONAL RS 8000 FOR REPAIR . NEVER EVEN GIVEN THE PHONE A BUMP . WHAT FURTHER NO JELLY BEAN UPGRADE ON EVEN MY FRIEND'S PHONE WHO GETS V2.3 OUT OF THE BOX . DONT BUY NOTE 2. IT IS NOT A GOOD PHONE AND NOT WORTH IT ."
Galaxy Note,1,"I JUST HATE THE PHONE ..I JUST HATE IT..FIRST TIME I HOLD THE PHONE IT WAS A REALLY DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE. ITS MASSIVE I CANT EVEN HOLD IT WITH MY ONE HAND ...MY SISTER WAS LAUGHING THE WAY I WAS HOLDING IT WITH TWO HANDS..SHE SAID BAAP RE !..REALLY, PHONES SHOULD NOT BE THAT BIG..NEXT THE PURPOSE OF MAKING SUCH BIG SCREENS IS SOLELY FOR WATCHING VIDEOS...NOW THAT IS WHERE I DOUBT THEIR TALENT...ITS A DISGUSTING DISPLAY. SUPERRR AMOLED = CRAP. STARTED PAIN AFTER WATCHING A CLIP FOR FEW MINUTES. TRUST ME ITS AN EYE KILLING DEVICE...I CUD NOT BELIEVE IT BCOZ I HAVE A SAMSUNG MONITOR LED WHICH IS THE BEST IN THE DISPLAY QUALITY ...SERIOUSLY I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW TO AWARE PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE EYES SPECIALLY CHILDREN AND YOUNGSTERS..BUY IT ONLY TO BCOME BLIND(I WAS FEELING IT) OR IF U WANT HEADACHE(MY SISTER WAS FEELING IT)..ALL APPS MOVIES PHOTOS ...ALL EXCITING IS GONE WHEN U LOOK AT THE DEVICE ...IF I HAVE BEEN  GRANTED A GOD WISH I WILL DESTROY AMOLED DISPLAY MACHINE.
      
      
      NEXT, 30K + AND CHEAP PLASTIC BACK COVER..? ARE WE THAT DUMB OR SAMSUNG DONT HAVE ANY CLASS  ! THE MATERIALS USED IS THE KEY AREA WHERE DEVICES PRICE JUMP AND CUSTOMER CHOOSE THE BEST OUT OF THE LOT..IN MY OPINION THIS PLASTIC PHONE SHOULD THROWN IN THE TRASH THE MOMENT WE PICK IT UP...IN THIS AREA , I FEEL SAMSUNG IS REALLY STEALING OUR MONEY.
      
      
      NEXT, UNPOLISHED APPS..OS..LAGS SOMETIMES..OS NOT EFFICIENTLY USES CPU'S POWER

      PROS :
      
      ------
      
      EXYNOS 4 : PERFORMANCE BUT OS CANT CAPITALIZE IT
      
      ANDROID : LOT OF FREE APPS..MANY ARE CRAPPY APPS BUT FREE APPS..SO GO AND DOWNLOAD FREE CRAPPY APPS
      
      PEN : SOLELY MADE FOR OFFICE PURPOSE..VERY  USEFUL ..USP FOR THE PRODUCT
      
      
      CONS : (LOTS OF)
      
      ---------------------
      
      DESIGN &AMP; AESTHETICS : EITHER SAMSUNG DON'T HAVE CLASS ( SAMSUNG DONT KNOW HOW TO MAKE GREAT PRODUCT) OR THEY ARE STEALING MONEY BY SELLING PLACTICS (MAKING HUGE MONEY)
      
      
      DISPLAY : DEADLY IN TERMS OF QUALITY..IT MAY SERIOUSLY HARM UR EYES AND CAUSE U HEADACHE !
      
      SIZE : DINOSAUR OF PHONES ..ITS TRULY NOT A PHONE ITS PHABLET CRAP.
      
      APPS : UNPOLISHED , JAGGY, LAGGY, AND FEELS CRAPPY
      
      PRICE : I FEEL THEY ARE ROBBING THE WORLD BY SELLING CHEAP PLASTIC INTENTIONALLY..I THINK THEY HAVE MADE A PROFIT OF A BILLION $ FROM IT..MOREOVER WHEN U GO TO SERVICE CENTERS IF PRODUCT HAVE NO WARRANTY..THE BIGGEST ILLITERATES, IDIOTS, CLOWNS AND RASCALS CHARGE U SAME AS IF A DOCTOR CHARGES IN METRO CITIES
      
      
      SAMSUNG IS THE BIGGEST FRAUD IN SMARTPHONE INDUSTRY.
      
      NEVER EVER BUY SAMSUNG ! I CANT GIVE -VE POINTS SO 1 STAR..."
Galaxy Note,1,"I MUST WARN YOU BEFORE BUYING ANY HTC PHONE! THE KIND OF SERVICE I HAVE RECEIVED IS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING CONSIDERING IT IS SUCH A BIG BRAND!
      
      
      IN THE PAST 1 YEAR THAT I HAVE OWNED MY HTC DESIRE Z, I HAVE HAD TO GIVE IT FOR SERVICING 2 TIMES. FIRST TIME THEY TOOK A MONTH TO REPAIR AND THE SECOND TIME, I WENT TO COLLECT IT AFTER ALMOST 2 MONTHS, AND WHILE CHECKING THE PHONE AT THE SERVICE CENTER, IT STARTED GIVING A COMPLETELY NEW PROBLEM!! SO HAD TO GIVE IT BACK IMMEDIATELY FOR ANOTHER REPAIR!!
      
      
      THEIR NETWORK IS SO BAD THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE PHONE. THEY HAVE OUTSOURCED THEIR FRONT-END SERVICE TO THE MOST USELESS PEOPLE WHO NEVER COOPERATE. THE CUSTOMER CARE IS JUST SOME CALL CENTER WHO SWEET-TALK YOU INTO BELIEVING YOU WILL GET THE PHONE WHILE THE ACTUAL SERVICE CENTER IS SOMEWHERE IN BANGALORE AND EVERYONE BLUNTLY REFUSES TO PROVIDE THE CONTACT NUMBER FOR THAT!!
      
      
      I HAVE WASTED SO MUCH TIME &AMP; MONEY ON MAKING CALLS TRYING TO FOLLOW UP AND I HAVE EVEN HAD TO GO TILL THEIR HIGHER MANAGEMENT BUT ITS OF NO USE...
      
      
      IF YOU ARE BUYING HTC, THEN YOU'RE JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE."
Galaxy Note,1,I WANTED TO CHECK IF THE 15% CASHBACK OFFER CAN BE AVAILED FOR CITIBANK CREDIT CARD AS WELL..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Galaxy Note,1,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE BEST ANDROID SMART-PHONE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE(AS IN TODAY 8TH FEB 2013) IN INDIA, THEN NO DOUBT THIS IS THE BEST PHONE(IF YOU ARE OKAY WITH THE SIZE).
      
      
      BUT THERE IS A DISADVANTAGE FOR THIS PHONE, THIS IS ONLY RELEVANT FOR THE MOST TECHNO FREAKS AMONG US(INCLUDING ME)...GOOGLE RELEASES TWO UPDATES TO ANDROID ANNUALLY AND ALL ANDROID LOVERS WANT TO GET THE LATEST VERSION ON THEIR ANDROID PHONE AT THE EARLIEST(SAMSUNG, HTC, SONY, LG EVERBODY LAGS IN UPDATING THEIR FLAGSHIPS TO THE LATEST ANDROID VERSION). ALSO AFTER A FEW UPDATES THEY FORGET THEIR FORMER FLAGSHIPS AND THE LOYAL CUSTOMERS WHO PAID NEARLY 40K OR UPWARDS TO BUY THEM..
      
      
      IN THIS SCENARIO, WE HAVE ROMS LIKE CYANOGENMOD , WHO CREATE THEIR OWN VERSION OF THE LATEST ANDROID OS VERSION FOR THE BEST AND THE MOST POPULAR ANDROID HANDSETS. IF YOUR ARE WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK, YOUR FORMER ANDROID FLAGSHIP CAN ENJOY THE LATEST VERSION OF ANDROID WITH ALL ITS GOODIES AND EXTRA FUNCTIONALITIES. THERE ARE CYANOGENMOD ROMS AVAILABLE FOR MANY POPULAR MODELS FROM HTC, SONY, LG AND SAMSUNG(IN MOST CASES WHEN THE MANUFACTURERS DECIDED NOT TO UPDATE THEIR DEVICES TO THE LATEST ANDROID VERSION).
      
      
      BUT SAMSUNG'S GALAXY S2 I9100 DOESN'T HAVE A FINAL JELLYBEAN VERSION AVAILABLE(THERE IS A BUG FILLED VERSION AVAILABLE). IT SHOULD HAVE GOT A FINAL WORKING ROM BY NOW RIGHT, IT WAS ON SALE IN JUNE 2011 AND ITS FEBRUARY 2013 NOW. YOU MAY WONDER WHY...AND THE NOT SO SECRET BUT NOT SO PUBLIC ANSWER IS GALAXY S2 I9100 CONTAINS SAMSUNG'S EXYNOS PROCESSOR(AN UPDATED EXYNOS PROCESSOR POWERS THE GALAXY S3 AND NOTE2) AND SAMSUNG IS VERY HESITANT IN PROVIDING THE REQUIRED PROPRIETARY SOURCE CODES FOR THE CYANOGENMOD TEAM. AND HENCE THEY HAVE VIRTUALLY KILLED THE POSSIBILITY OF A WORKING USABLE CYANOGENMOD ROM FOR THE GALAXY S2 I9100.
      
      
      THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY HAS TIME AND AGAIN REQUESTED SAMSUNG TO RELEASE THOSE CODES BUT THEY HAVE ONLY RELENTED PARTIALLY. THERE ARE NUMEROUS POSTS ON THE ISSUE ON THE DEVELOPER FORUMS ON INTERNET.
      
      
      IN MARKED CONTRAST TO THIS ARE THE PHONES POWERED BY QUALCOMM'S, TI'S AND NVIDIA'S PROCESSORS WHICH HAVE BETTER CHANCE AT CYANOGENMOD ROM'S AS ALL OF THESE PROCESSOR MANUFACTURERS ARE OPEN TO PROVIDING THEIR SOURCE CODES TO THE OPEN DEVELOPER COMMUNITY.
      
      
      SAMSUNG MAY HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS TO NOT RELEASE THEIR EXYNOS SOURCE CODES; BUT FOR YOU AND ME; WHO PAID TOP SHELF MONEY TO GET THE LATEST AND BEST ANDROID SMARTPHONE; WE NEED TO BE TREATED BETTER THAN THIS.
      
      
      WE NEED TO PROVIDED EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE THE LATEST ANDROID VERSION IN THE DEVICE WE BOUGHT; ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS A FLAGSHIP. AND SAMSUNG SMART PHONES WITH EXYNOS PROCESSORS ARE NOT GOOD AT THIS.
      
      
      SO IF YOU ARE A GEEK AND YOU LIKE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE LATEST ANDROID OS ON YOUR FLAGSHIPS, SUGGEST YOU WAIT FOR FLAGSHIPS WHICH ARE POWERED BY QUALCOMM PROCESSORS.(CURRENTLY SNAPDRAGON S4, 2013 JUNE ONWARDS SNAPDRAGON 600, SNAPDRAGON 800,). THESE PROCESSORS WILL POWER FLAGSHIPS FROM HTC, LG AND SONY. CHECK FOR THESE NAMES IN THE PROCESSOR COLUMN AND YOU MAY GET A BETTER DEAL...
      
      
      HACKING/FLASHING YOUR PHONE WITH ANY ROM INCLUDING CYANOGENMOD ROMS HAS A CHANCE OF BRICKING(MAKING A USELESS  BRICK OF YOUR PHONE) YOUR PHONE. SO PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.NOT ADVISED FOR NOVICE USERS."
Galaxy Note,1,"SAMSUNG MOBILES ARE CRAP , I PURCHASED GALAXY NOTE, IT USED TO GET RED HOT, SO HOT THAT I WOULD HAVE LOST MY EARS IF I HAD USED IT MORE THAN 3 MTHS, I SOLD IT , U KNOW WHAT I SOLD IT AT A LOSS OF 7000/- .

Galaxy S Advance,5,"AFTER DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH I ZEROED IN ON THIS PHONE AS IT HAD LOTS OF FEATURES FOUND IN TOP-END PHONES, UPGRADABLE TO JB, SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT TROUSER POCKET, TOUGH ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE DAILY GRIND, AND IT IS FROM SAMSUNG STAPLE WHICH IS NO.1 IN INDIA IN ANDROID SMARTPHONES.  THE ONLY PROBLEM I SAW WAS IN THE PRICE WHICH WAS RS.19,000/- A FEW MONTHS AGO.  I WAITED FOR THE PRICE TO COME DOWN AND ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO, I BROUGHT THIS FROM FLIPKART FOR RS.14000/-(THIS MODEL WAS OUT OF STOCK IN MOST RETAIL OUTLETS IN BENGALURU AT RS. 13,500). I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE EVEN WITH GINGERBREAD!  I JUST BROUGHT A SILICONE CAP AND A SCREEN GUARD FOR ADDED SAFETY.  THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE IS AMAZING!!!!  GO FOR IT BEFORE THE STOCKS ARE OUT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"AFTER USING THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT A MONTH WITH GB AND THEN ABOUT 3 WEEKS WITH JB...I'M JUST LOVING IT!!!
      
      A FACTORY RESET AFTER THE UPGRADE SOLVES A LOT OF PROBLEMS...I HAVE ABOUT 220 MB RAM FREE AT ALL TIMES...UPGRADE TO JB(4.1.2) CAN BE DONE THROUGH KIES...
      
      UPTO 720P VIDEOS RUN FLAWLESS...GAMING IS TOO GOOD ON THIS...FIFA 12 RUNS SMOOTH...TEMPLE RUN WITH NEGLIGIBLE (IF NOT ZERO) LAGS...
      
      ONLY PROBLEM I FACED WAS SIZE OF RECORDED VIDEO...IT TAKES ABOUT 94 MB FOR A 1 MINUTE VIDEO...APART FROM THAT...IT'S AWESOME!!"

Galaxy S Advance,5,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR 12825(MADE IN VIETNAM &AMP; NOT IN CHINA)...FOR THIS PRICE IT IS TOTALLY A FEATURE PACKED PHONE..WITH 2 DAYS OF USAGE,HERE A SOME PROS AND CONS-
      
      +ITS BIGGEST PROS IS SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY, COLORS LOOK BRIGHT AND VIVD AND DISPLAY IS CLEAR AND CRISP, NO PROBLEM TO USE THIS PHONE IN SUNLIGHT..
      
      +INTERNAL STORAGE IS 16GB OUT OF WHICH 11GB IS FOR MASS STORAGE AND 1.9 GB IS FOR APPS INSTALLATION, 2GB FOR APPS IS GOOD..
      
      +I M NOT A MOBILE GAMER, USUALLY PLAY PC GAMES BUT TESTED WITH TRICKY GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN AND FRONTLINE COMMANDO, IT WORKED WITHOUT DROPPING A FRAME, THANKS TO MALI V7 GPU..
      
      +CAMERA IS GOOD, FLASH IS EXTREMELY GOOD,THERE ARE LOT OF DETAILS IN IMAGE WITH LIL BIT OF NOISE SO THATS OK FOR PHONE OF THIS PRICE, U CANT EXPECT MUCH...
      
      +SOUND IS OK, NOT TOO GOOD NOT TOO BAD...
      
      +TESTED 1280X720 VIDEOS, IT WORKED FLAWLESSLY,MOVIE WATCHING IS JOY...
      
      +NET BROWSING IS AMAZING, ONE OF THE MAJOR ADVANTAGE,NO LAG AT ALL EVEN WITH HEAVY WEB PAGES...
      
      CONS
      
      -RAM IS 555MB WHICH IS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,U CAN UPGRADE IT TO JELLYBEAN FOR 625MB RAM...
      
      -HEADPHONE IS AVERAGE WITH AVERAGE BASS AND LOT OF NOISE..
      
      -BATTERY LIFE IS MEDIOCRE,DOESN'T LAST LONG WITH HEAVY USAGE...
      
      -MAY NOT RUN EXTREMELY GRAPHICS INTENSIVE GAMES...
      
      FOR THIS PRICE, IT IS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER DUAL CORES PHONES LIKE XPERIA SOLA OR HTC DESIRE X,BLINDLY BUY IT,ITS PRODUCTION HAS BEEN STOPPED SO BE QUICK INDEED..
      
      IF U WANT A PHONE FOR GAMING THEN SPEND 10K  MORE AND BUY NEXUS 4(THE BEAST), BUT FOR NOT TOO HARDCORE GAMING, WEB BROWSING AND EVERDAY USAGE THIS PHONE IS SIMPLY THE BEST...!!!!!"

      SO FAR SO GOOD
      
      
      UPDATED IT TO JELLY BEAN AND LOVE THE POWER SAVING OPTIONS OF IT. IT WORKS GREAT AND ADD IT WITH AN APP AND IT WILL DO A BETTER JOB. HOWEVER, THE BATTERY OF 1500MAH IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS PHONE. SAMSUNG SHOULD HAVE PUT IN A BIT MORE JUICE IN THIS AREA.
      
      
      THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS OF 16GB HOWEVER 11.5GB CAN BE USED. I THINK FOR APPLICATIONS THE LIMIT IS AROUND 1.8GB. THE STORAGE OPTIONS ARE A BIT CONFUSING BUT IT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR MY USE. THE MUSIC PLAYS GOOD, THE CAMERA IS GOOD.
      
      
      THE BUILD SCARES ME A BIT AND THE BACK OF THE PHONE HAS THE PLASTICKY FEEL. I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THE HEADPHONE PORT AND THE MINI USB PORT IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PHONE.
      
      
      HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS CAME FOR 14,000 AND AT THIS PRICE THERE IS NO OTHER PHONE (SAMSUNG, HTC, NOKIA, MOTOROLA) WHICH CAN MATCH THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THIS PHONE, I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.

Galaxy S Advance,5,DELIVERY FROM FLIPKART WAS LITLE BIT LATE BUT MOBILE IS AWESUMM.....BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT DOESNT HAVE GORILLA GLASS...UPDATE FOR JELLY BEAN IS AVAILABLE...IT IS ONE OF THE BEST AVAILABLE MOBILE IN THE MARKET FOR THIS PRICE...

Galaxy S Advance,5,"FIRST OF ALL A BIG THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR ITS WELL KNOWN DELIVERY SERVICE &AMP; FOR THE GR8 PRICE (13K) BECOZ I GOT D PHONE WITH A CASH BACK DISOUNT.
      
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PHONE, LIKE ALL OTHER MODEL IT ALSO HAS SOME PROS AND CONS. YOU CAN COUNT PROS BUT YOU CANNOT COUNT CONS AS IN 13K HOW MUCH YOU CAN EXPECT. I HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE WHO IS SHOUTING FOR ITS CONS, THEY MUST UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT GALAXY S2 OR S3. I CAN SAY IT IS THE BEST PHONE IN ITS PRICE RANGE. AFTER 1 WEEK OF ITS CONTINUOUS USE I CAN SAY:
      
      
      BUILD QUALITY:DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST MADE DEVICE IN THE MARKET BUT THE BACK PANEL IS NOT SO GOOD.
      
      
      DISPLAY: SUPER AMOLED SCREEN IS THE BIG PLUS FOR THIS PHONE.ITS SIMPLY FANTASTIC, EVEN MUCH HIGHLY PRICED PHONES LIKE GALAXY GRAND
      
      
      ANDROID VERSION : LAUNCHES WITH GINGERBREAD,BUT NOW IT CAN BE UPGRADABLE TO ANDROID 4.1.2 JB
      
      
      CALL QUALITY: THE VOICE IS CLEAR AND THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNAL ISSUES. ITS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL FEATURE OF THE PHONE AND GOOD TO SEE SAMSUNG HAS NOT OVERLOOKED AT IT.
      
      
      BATTERY: BATTERY BACKUP IS NOT A PROBLEM OF THIS PHONE, THIS IS PRESENT EVERYWHERE IN ANDROID. THOUGH ITS BATTERY LAST 16-18 HOURS WITH ALL KIND OF USE. IF YOU SURF INTERNET A LOT AND ALSO PLAY LOT OF GAMES THEN I'LL ADVISE TO CARRY A CHARGER WITH YOU.YOU CAN USE 2X BATTERY SAVER IT IMPROVES THE BATTERY LIFE(PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)
      
      
      CAMERA: FRONT CAMERA SERVE THE PURPOSE OF VIDEO CHAT, NOT REALLY GOOD BUT YES IT DOES YOUR WORK. BACK CAMERA IS GOOD WITH FLASH AND CAN TAKE GOOD PICS.NO 1080P VIDEO RECORDING(WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT ON 13K PHONE)
      
      
      SPEAKERS:EXTERNAL SPEAKER QUALITY IS SOMEWHAT LOW.BUT THE EARPHONE COMES WITH THE PACKAGE IS SIMPLY GR8.
      
      
      FOR GAME LOVERS MOST OF THE GAMES RUNS SMOOTH IN THIS PHONE. MEMORY EXPENSIVE GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN RUN VERY SMOOTH WITHOUT ANY LAGS. I'LL ADVISE TO CLEAR YOUR MEMORY (RAM) BEFORE STARTING ANY GAME. THIS PHONE COMES WITH MALI 400 GPU WHICH IS BEST IN MARKET AND WHICH COMES IN S3, NOTE 1 &AMP; 2.
      
      
      OVERALL IF YOU WANT A MID BUDGET SMART PHONE THEN DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME IN LOOKING REVIEWS OVER THE NET. IT CAN ONLY DISTRACT YOU. I WILL SUGGEST GO FOR IT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO REGRET. OTHER BRANDS LIKE NOKIA, HTC, SONY WILL NOT PROVIDE YOU THE SAME FEATURE AT 14K. ONE MORE THING DON'T COMPARE THIS WITH OTHER BRANDS (SO CALLED BRANDS) LIKE MICROMAX AND KARBON.

      OS IS GINGERBREAD (GB) OUT OF BOX, YOU CAN UPDATE WITH LATEST JELLY BEAN(JB) WHICH IS AVAILABLE THROUGH SAMSUNG KIES. BUT I'LL ADVISE NOT TO UPGRADE TO JB AS IT HAS SOME LAGGING ISSUE. YOU CAN SEE REVIEWS THAT AFTER UPGRADE TO JB PHONE STARTS LAGGING. GB IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS PHONE WITH SOME RESTRICTION LIKE CAMERA ZOOM.

      SENSORS  :THE PHONE BOASTS ACCELEROMETERS FOR MOVEMENT SPEED,PROXIMITY SENSORS FOR SWITCHING DISPLAY OFF DURING PHONECALL,LIGHT SENSORS FOR AUTOMATIC BRIGHTNESS,GEOMAGNETIC SENSORS FOR DIRECTIONS(NORTH,EAST,SOUTH,WEST) AND GYRO SENSORS FOR ORIENTATION CHANGE
      
      
      DISPLAY: (RESOLUTION:480X856 PXL | SIZE: 4INCH | PIXEL DENSITY :233 PPI)
      
      THE DISPLAY IS UNEXPLAINABLY IMPRESSIVE, AND WITH THE SUPER AMOLED SCREEN ,THE VIVIDNESS OF COLORS CANT BE EXPRESSED IN WORDS ,SAMSUNG HAS A SAMPLE VIDEO ALREADY LOADED ON THE PHONE WHEN U GET IT. THE DISPLAY HAS HIGH PIXEL DENSITY FOR A MID RANGE PHONE,SUPER CLARITY AND IT ALSO HAS AUTO BRIGHTNESS SO U DON?T HAVE WORRY ABOUT DIRECT SUNLIGHT VIEW , MAN ITS IMPRESSIVE, TWO SECONDS AFTER YOU GET INTO SUNLIGHT THE DISPLAY AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST TO A HIGHER BRIGHTNESS WHICH VIEWABLE.
      
      
      TOUCH: (SUPER RESPONSIVE| UP TO 10 FINGER TOUCH /ZOOM SUPPORT)
      
      CAPACITIVE TOUCH SCREEN DOES A VERY DECENT JOB.
      
      
      CAMERA: (PRIMARY(BACK FACING)= 5MP | SECONDARY (FRONT FACING) = 1.3 MP)
      
      VERY GOOD  PHOTO QUALITY WHEN SEEN FROM MOBILE AND EXCELLENT WHEN SEEN ON COMPUTER,
      
      BUT THE COLOR QUALITY WILL BE LESS WHEN SEEN FROM THE COMPUTER(THANKS TO AMOLED SCREEN OF THE PHONE).THE CAMERA DOESN?T HAVE A ZOOM FEATURE  (THIS BECAUSE OF THE ANDROID VERSION AND THIS  IS SOLVED IN THE JELLY BEAN ANDROID UPDATE). THE VIDEO RECORDING QUALITY IS PERFECT AN IT RECORDS AT 1280X 720P AS SPECIFIED. THE PRIMARY CAMERA IS GOOD WITH DECENT VIDEO CALL QUALITY(IT IS GOOD TO GET A SECONDARY CAMERA EXACTLY 1 MP NOT LESS AND NOT MORE AS THE INTERNET CONNECTION OF THE CONNECTION PROVIDERS IN INDIA DOESN?T PROVIDE HIGH SPEED INTERNET SO A LOW QUALITY VIDEO IS SUITABLE FROM A FRONT CAMERA, IF YOU HAVE A 3G CONNECTION ITS OKAY)
      
      THE LED FLASH IS TOO GOOD IN THE DARK AND PROVIDES DECENT LIGHTING FOR CAPTURING VIDEOS AND PHOTOS.
      
      
      MEMORY AND STORAGE: (INTERNAL 16 GB | 768MB RAM | EXTERNAL MICRO SD SUPPORTED AND EXPANDABLE UP TO 32 GB)
      
      
      TO BE CLEAR THE PHONE COMES WITH THE INTERNAL MEMORY DIVIDED AS FOLLOWS
      
      THE 16 GB IS DIVIDED TO
      
      11GB USER MEMORY :(U CAN USE IT TO STORE WALLPAPERS, MUSIC, VIDEOS ETC  IE , ALL YOU STUFF LIKE A MEMORY CARD)
      
      2 GB APPLICATION MEMORY (TO INSTALL YOUR ANDROID APPS)
      
      AND 2 GB SYSTEM MEMORY (THE ANDROID  OPERATING SYSTEM USES THIS AND YOU CAN?T SEE THIS)
      
      AND  YOU CAN ALSO BUY A MICRO SD CARD AND USE IT IN THE PHONE (EXTERNAL STORAGE ,MAXIMUM  A 32 GB MICRO SD CARD)
      
      
      DIMENSIONS : EASY TO HANDLE USING ONE HAND, A LITTLE BIG FOR THE JEANS POCKET WHILE USING TWO WHEELERS . :)
      
      
      CONTACTS AND SMS STORAGE: REALLY UNLIMITED  :)
      
      NOW FOR THE REALM PART ,
      
      THE SYSTEM HARD WARE: THE DUAL CORE 1 GHZ ARM CORTEX-A9 PROCESSOR INDEED DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF DELIVERING HIGH SPEED ,CRISP PERFORMANCE, NEVER FELT BEING SLOW.
      
      
      THANKS TO THE GRAPHICS PROCESSOR, THE MALI 400MP  GPU , GAMING IS A IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE
      
      WHEN COMBINED WITH THE VIVID SCREEN AND EVEN NFS MOST WANTED, ASPHALT 7,NOVA 3, SHADOWGUN ETC WORKED ON THIS PHONE..
      
      
      THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE PHONE :  THE ANDROID OPERATING  SYSTEM
      
      WE HAVE 2.3.6 GINGERBREAD VERSION OF THE ANDROID OS , LOADED ON THE PHONE WHEN WE GET IKT , THE PHONE CAN BE UPGRADED TO LATEST  JELLY BEAN (4.1.2) VERSION (INDIAN UPDATES WILL BE SOON AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SAMSUNG KIES SOFTWARE (YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THIS FROM THE SAMSUNG WEBSITE))."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"HELLO FOLKS!!!!! I WUD LIKE TO THANK FLIPKART FR THEIR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY WITHIN 3 DAYS TIME!!!!!
      
      
      COMIN TO THE PHONE , THIS IS MY 2ND ANDROID PHONE. THE 1ST ONE WAS MY LG P690 OPTIMUS NET WHICH HASN'T DISAPPOINTED ME TILL DATE. I DECIDED TO BUY A BETTER HIGH END PHONE , WHICH ARE MY FOLL SPECS:
      
      THE PHONE SHUD BE A DUAL CORE, 5 MP CAMERA(HD RECORDING NOT NECESSARY), FRONT FACING CAM , ALL THE SENSORS(FEW PHONES DO NOT HAVE LIGHT SENSORS),4 INCH SCREEN,GOOD GPU ,GOOD BATTERY AND GOOD INTERNAL MEMORY.
      
      NOW GSA(GALAXY S ADVANCE) HAS PROVIDED WITH MOST OF THE SPECS(THE BATTERY SHUD HAVE BEEN ATLEAST 1700MAH).
      
      
      DISPLAY:THE GSA PHONE HAS A DISPLAY OF 4 INCH WITH SUPER AMOLED WHICH ACTUALLY USES LESS BATTERY THAN OTHER PHONES XCEPT CLEAR BLACK DISPLAY.I WAS DAMN IMPRESSED WITH THE PIC QUALITY WHILE WATCHING MOVIES OR PLAYING A GAME!!!!!10/10
      
      
      CAMERA AND SOUND QUALITY: THE 5 MP CAMERA CLICKS QUITE GUD SNAPS SO M HAPPY AS FOR HD RECORDING IT DOESNT LUK THT GR8T AS U WUD XPECT FROM A DIGICAM!!!7/10(NOKIA 620 GIVES BETTER SNAPS)
      
      AS FOR THE SOUND QUALITY IT IS PRETTY LOUD FOR ME SINCE THEY SPEAKERS DO NOT CRACKLE. I LOVE THE IN EAR HEADSET!!!!!10/10
      
      
      MISC: I DO NOT WASTE TIME TALKING ABOUT THE SPECS ,BUT THE PHONE IS SMOOTH WHEN IT COMES TO GB OS, I HAVENT TRIED JB OS AS THERE A LOT OF COMPLAINS ABOUT IT. THE EXTENT TO WHICH GAMES CAN BE PLAYED IS AWESOME!!!!!SINCE THERE WAS NO OTHER COLOUR FOR GSA , I BROUGHT A WHITE BACK COVER TO MAKE IT LUK DIFFERENT!!!!
      
      
      ANYWYS FOLKS , IF U REALLY WANNA BUY A PHONE ,GO FOR THIS ONE ,ALSO THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING NOKIA 620 AS U HAVE TO TRIM THE SIM CARD WHICH IS WHY I OPTED FOR THIS PHONE!!!!"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I AM HAPPY TO USE THIS MOBILE GOOD PERFOMANCE THEN GALAXY S, BUT FLIP COVER NOT INCLUDED IN THE BOX.ABOUT FLIPKART BEST PRICING AND FAST .
      
      I AM HAPPY TO USE THIS MOBILE GOOD PERFOMANCE THEN GALAXY S, BUT FLIP COVER NOT INCLUDED IN THE BOX.ABOUT FLIPKART BEST PRICING AND FAST DELIVERY"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. I HAD BEEN SEARCHING LONG FOR A GOOD ANDROID PHONE BUT DIDNT WANT TO SPEND A GRAND SUM FOR THE LATEST FEATURES. THIS PHONE HAS A GREAT SPEC FOR THE PRICE. EVEN THOUGH IT IS DISCONTINUED, THERE ARE FEW PHONES IN THE MARKET WHICH CAN MATCH IT IN TERMS OF SPECS AT THIS PRICE POINT. I REALLY LOVE THE SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY WHICH HAS SOME GREAT VIEWING ANGLES. I PREFER THE 4"" SCREEN COMPARED TO THE NEW NORM FOR 4.8/5"" SCREENS WHICH MAKES SUCH PHONES UNCOMFORTABLE TO HOLD. THIS PHONE IS LIGHT AND FEELS GREAT TO HOLD IN THE HAND AND ALL THE FUNCTIONS ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE. THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE BEING IT IS LOADED WITH GINGERBREAD. BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE TECH SAVVY, THEY CAN EASILY UPGRADE IT TO JELLY BEAN THE MOMENT YOU RECEIVE IT (LIKE I DID)! WORD OF ADVICE REGARDING BATTERY CONSUMPTION - IT DOES EAT A LOT OF BATTERY BECAUSE OF THE BRILLIANT DISPLAY AND THE AUTO BRIGHTNESS SETTING. INSTALL AN APP LIKE JUICE DEFENDER TO STRETCH YOUR BATTERY LIFE AND ALSO PREVENT UNWANTED SERVICES FROM RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND. IT ALSO HAS SOME ""BLING"" FEATURES LIKE CALLING A CONTACT WHEN YOU BRING THE PHONE CLOSE TO YOUR EAR OR MUTING AN INCOMING CALL WHEN YOU FLIP THE PHONE (THIS WORKS IF YOU ARE PLAYING MUSIC ALSO). CAMERA IS NOT ITS STRONG POINT BUT IT SHOOTS SOME DECENT PICTURES IN DAYLIGHT. ANOTHER POINT TO NOTE IS THAT THE DEFAULT PLAYER DOESNT PLAY 1080/720P FILES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. I TRIED THIS WITH BOTH MKV AND MP4 FILES. YOU HAVE TO INSTALL THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE LIKE VLC OR MX PLAYER FOR PLAYING SUCH VIDEOS.
      
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A GOOD ANDROID PHONE UNDER 15K."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I AM SATISHFIED WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY S.ADVANCE BECAUSE OF IT'S DESIGN,CAMERA &AMP; ALL.ALSO FLIPKART DELIVERY IS SO GOOD......................
      
      CAMERA-CAMERA  CLARITY IS SO NICE WITH FLASH
      
      SPEED IS GOOD.............
      
      NICE PHONE ...........LOVE IT.........."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE JUST 2 DAYS AGO AND  GOT AN UPDATE TO JELLYBEAN YESTERDAY. ITS AWESOME.FINALLY THE MUCH AWAITED OFFICIAL ANDROID 4.1 UPDATE ARRIVES TO USERS IN INDIA. AND BY THE WAY, THE PHONE IS SUPER COOL- GREAT DESIGN, SOLID PERFORMANCE,AVERAGE CAMERA AND GREAT SCREEN."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I DONT WANT TO MENTION ABOUT ANY OF PROS AND CONS ABOUT THE PHONE AS THEY R REPEATED IN THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS..
      
      IT WOULD BE EVEN GREAT IF FLIPKART OFFERS ANY MEMORY CARD OR COVER WITH THIS PHONE..........."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I GOT THIS PHONE DELIVERED IN 2 DAYS. VERY HAPPY WITH ITS PERFORMANCE. EXCELLENT SCREEN, AUDIO QUALITY, IMAGES WITH FLASH....
      
      
      I HAVE COUPLE OF DOUBTS -
      
      1. IF I UPDATE IN INDIA WITH THE UK UPDATE WILL THAT VOID MY WARRANTY ?
      
      2. DOES USB OTG WORK ON THIS PHONE ?"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR 1 AND HALF MONTHS... MUST SAY THAT IT IS AN AWESOME PHONE AT THIS RANGE... WELL AS THERE ARE MANY REVIEWS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OR PROS OF THIS PHONE I WON'T BE GOING INTO THAT. RATHER I WOULD LIKE TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE CONS OF THIS PRODUCT
      
      
      1. BATTERY IS ONLY 1500MAH... WHICH IS INSUFFICIENT FOR THIS PHONE.... IT SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST 2000MAH TO GET A DECENT EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      2. THERE ARE SOME NETWORK ISSUES WITH THE PHONE WHEN IT IS RUNNING IN GINGERBREAD(2.3.3) BUT I DIDNT FIND ANY ISSUES ONCE IT WAS UPDATED TO JELLYBEAN(4.1.2)...
      
      
      3. THE JELLYBEAN UPDATE CHANGES THE WHOLE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE PHONE BUT IT LAGS MORE THAN WHEN IT HAD GINGERBREAD IN IT...
      
      
      4. THE BACK PLASTIC COVER IS REALLY VERY THIN AND IS MADE OF CHEAP PLASTIC. I SUGGEST YOU TO USE FLIP COVER WHICH WILL HAVE A BETTER PLASTIC BACK COVER THAN THE ORIGINAL ONE.
      
      
      THESE ARE THE PROBLEMS WHICH I HAVE FACED TILL NOW, BUT REST ASSURED THIS IS THE BEST ANDROID PHONE YOU CAN GET WITHIN 15K RANGE IF YOU WANT TO BUY A PREMIUM BRAND SMARTPHONE. SO BUYERS, PLEASE DONT GET SCARED WITH THE CONS IF YOU ARE TIGHT IN BUDGET.... THIS IS THE BEST PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE... :)"
Galaxy S Advance,5,I HAVE PURCHASED THIS MOBILE LAST WEEK IT WAS TOO GUD FOR ITS PRICE COMPARE TO OTHER MOBILE......THX FOR THE SAMSUNG FOR GIVING JELLY BEEN UPDATE AND THX FOR FLIPKART FOR THAT PRICE.......................
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I M VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH THIS DEVICE.I TOOK SOME TIME FOR WRITING THIS REVIEW BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANTED TO WRITE MY OPINION AS SOON AS I BOUGHT IT.
      
      YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY UPGRADE IT TO JELLY BEAN
      
      (((FROM HERE""HTTP://WWW.ANDROID.GS/UPDATE-GALAXY-S-ADVANCE-I9070-OFFICIAL-JELLY-BEAN-4-1-2-XXLQ4/""))),
      
      AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,COZ THERE ARE FEATURES LIKE
      
      1. INCREASE OF RAM SIZE
      
      2. WHEN YOU TAKE THE CELL TO YOUR EARS WITH A CONTACT ON THE SCREEN IT WILL GO FOR A CALL(YEP...IT'S TRUE)
      
      
      THE MOST AMAZING THING IN THIS PHONE IS IT'S HIGH PACKED SUPER AMOLED SCREEN,YOU WILL LOVE TO TOUCH IT ONCE MORE THAN U ALREADY DID."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I ORDERED IT ON 09TH AFTERNOON AND I RECEIVED IT 10TH BEFORE NOON. AGAIN FLIPKART DELIVERY, PACKING AND TIMING IS EXCELLENT. ABOUT THE SMARTPHONE, IT IS WOW FOR SUCH A PRICE AMOUNG SAMSUNG. EXCELLENT FEATURES FOR SUCH LOW PRICE. NO PROBLEM AT ALL AND I UPGRADED TO JELLY BEAN SO EASILY VIA KIES. I WAS IN A DILEMMA OF GETTING SONY, SAMSUNG AND HTC. BUT LATER I FOUND THIS AS THE BEST IN SAMSUNG FOR LOW COST.
      
      BOTTOM LINE IS SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE IS SIMPLY BEST"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT ON 1ST MAY AND GOT IT ON 4TH MAY. AWESOME EXPERIENCE WITH FLIPKART AS ALWAYS.
      
      
      AND ABOUT THE PRODUCT- ITS BEEN 2 WEEKS SINCE I AM USING THIS PHONE AND FEW INPUTS FROM MY SIDE -
      
      
      1) SPECIFICATIONS
      
      IN SPECIFICATIONS ITS WRITTEN THAT RAM, ROM, USB MEMORY IS 768 MB, 4GB AND 16 GB WHILE IN THE PHONE IT IS SHOWING 555 MB, 1.97 GB AND 11.31 GB RESPECTIVELY. DONT KNOW WHETHER ITS THERE IN MY HANDSET ONLY BUT I DOUBT IT BECAUSE I READ FEW FLIPKART REVIEWS WHEREIN OTHERS HAVE ALSO SAID IT.
      
      
      2) GAMERS MAY FACE A BIT PROBLEM
      
      ALSO I HAVE BEEN PLAYING TEMPLE RUN SINCE THE FIRST DAY I GOT THE PHONE. I HAVE TO USUALLY GO TO TASK MANAGER AND STOP FEW OF THE APPLICATIONS SO THAT MY GAME RUNS AT ITS USUAL SPEED ELSE IF I DIRECTLY START PLAYING TEMPLE RUN, THE PHONE LAGS A BIT. NOTE THAT SO FAR I HAVE ONLY INSTALLED 4 APPS SO FAR- WHATSAPP, VIBER, TEMPLERUN, ANDROID ASSISTANT AND ALREADY I AM FACING THIS PROBLEM.
      
      
      3) JELLY BEAN UPGRADE SLOWS DOWN THE PHONE
      
      THIRD THING IS - ALTHOUGH JELLY BEAN UPDATE IS AVAILABLE BUT A/Q TO INTERNET REVIEWS IT SLOWS DOWN UR PHONE. TONIGHT I THOUGHT I WILL UPGRADE TO JELLY BEAN BUT WHEN I TURNED TO INTERNET FOR KNOW-HOW ABOUT UPGRADATION, WHAT I FOUND WAS USERS COMPLAINING  THAT AFTER UPGRADATION, THEIR PHONES ARE HANGING A LOT AND APPLICATIONS ARE TAKING A LOT OF TIME TO RUN AND THAT THEY ARE THINKING TO REVERT BACK TO GINGERBREAD.
      
      
      AND ABOUT THE PLUS POINTS ITS IN MOST OF THE OTHER REVIEWS.
      
      
      MY EXPERIENCE- I THINK ITS A GOOD BUY, I M HAPPY HAVING IT RATHER I AM LOVING IT AND THE EXPERIENCE SO FAR HAS BEEN AWESOME :) EXCEPT ABOVE ISSUES BUT THEN I AM NOT A BIG GAMER AND DONT MIND HAVING GINGERBREAD.
      
      
      HOPE THIS HELPS AND U BUY THE BEST ONE FOR URSELF. ATB."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I PURCHASED THIS MOBILE FROM HOMESHOP.
      
      FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO DEFINE ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH HOMESHOP.
      
      IT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME. FIVE STAR FROM MY SIDE. I GOT MY DELIVERY IN JUST 3 DAYS. EXCELLENT DELIVERY TIME. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. EXCELLENT PACKAGING AND VERY EXCELLENT PRICE. MARKET PRICE WAS 14000 BUT VIA SUPERDEALS I GOT IT AT JUST 11995 RS. OVERALL HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE.
      
      NOW MY VIEWS ABOUT PRODUCT -
      
      PROS -
      
      GREAT BUILD QUALITY.
      
      SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY (BIG PLUS)
      
      DUAL CORE CORTEX A9 (BIG PLUS)
      
      16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY (BIGGEST PLUS)
      
      786 MB RAM (BUT WITH JELLY BEAN UPDATE 4.1.2 IT SHOULD BE 1GB, BUT IN THIS PRICE RANGE IT IS BEST)
      
      GREAT CAMERA QUALITY. FRONT CAMERA IS ALSO GOOD WITH 1.3 MEGAPIXEL RESOLUTION.
      
      DECENT GOOD BATTERY BACKUP. (STANDS FOR ONE DAY EASILY AND TWO DAYS IN NORMAL USE)
      
      
      CONS -
      
      SOME PERSONS DON'T LIKE ITS SHAPE FROM SIDE AND REAR. BUT I AM SATISFIED.
      
      EXTERNAL SPEAKER QUALITY IS DECENT. NOT TOO GOOD. S2 HAS BEST EXTERNAL SOUND.
      
      SOMETIMES LAGS AFTER UPDATING TO OFFICIAL JELLY BEAN 4.1.2
      
      GAMES RUNS SMOOTH BUT A LITTLE LAG SOMETIMES WHEN PLAYING HIGH DEFINITION GAMES. IT IS BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT RAM. BUT WITH JINGERBREAD ITS OK.
      
      
      OVERALL A WORTH BUYING AT THIS PRICE RANGE. VERY MUCH BETTER THEN GALAXY S DUOS. BOTH HAVE SAME PRICE RANGE BUT ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT WITH EACH OTHER.
      
      S ADVANCE ROCKS....!!"
Galaxy S Advance,5,I PURCHASED THIS PHONE FEW WEEK AGO FROM FLIPKART. IT IS REALLY AMAZING PHONE FOR THE PRICE RANGE. ALL THE APPS ARE WORKING GOOD. TOUCH AND DISPLAY ARE AMAZING.SKYPE IS WORKING SUPERBLY EVEN FOR 2G DATA.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR THOSE WHO WANTS AN ANDROID PHONE UNDER 15K.
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I PURCHASED THIS SMARTPHONE A WEEK BACK FROM FLIPKART FOR 13K (500 CASHBACK OFFER) ...
      
      AS USUAL, FLIPKART ROCKED WITH ITS PACKAGE AND DELIVERY EXCELLENCE...
      
      IMMEDIATELY UPDATED TO JELLYBEAN VIA KIES ...
      
      AFTER USING IT FOR A WEEK AND COMPARING IT WITH S DUOS WHICH IS PRICED AT 12K,
      
      PROS -
      
      1) THE SUPER AMOLED SCREEN IS THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE OF THIS SMARTPHONE (REMEMBER 13K)... PICTURES, VIDEOS AND GAMES ARE VERY CRISP AND CLEAR THAT CANVAS HD SHOULD RENAME ITSELF TO CANVAS POOR SD... IT EASILY BEATS SONY AND HTC DISPLAYS... AMOLED ALSO HELPS IN SAVING BATTERY.... (S DUOS JUST HAS A TFT SCREEN)
      
      2) 16 GB INTERNAL STORAGE + 32 GB EXTERNAL STORAGE PROVIDES HELL A LOT SPACE TO STORE MUSIC, PHOTOS, MOVIES AND DOCUMENTS (REMEMBER 13K).... (S DUOS JUST HAS 4 GB INTERNAL STORAGE)
      
      3) JELLYBEAN UPDATE PROVIDES YOU WITH CAMERA ZOOM, MOTION SENSOR, GOOGLE NOW, BUTTER SMOOTH TOUCH SCREEN PERFORMANCE AND MUCH MORE... ALSO OTHER REVIEWS FORGOT TO MENTION ABOUT PANORAMA MODE (REMEMBER 13K) .... (JELLYBEAN UPDATE NOT YET AVAILABLE FOR S DUOS)
      
      4) 1 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR PROVIDES GREAT MULTITASKING PERFORMANCE (REMEMBER 13K) ... QUAD CORE DRAINS BATTERY (S DUOS JUST HAS A SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR)
      
      5) MALI 400 GPU PROVIDES THE BEST GAMING EXPERIENCE IN SMARTPHONES ... (S DUOS JUST HAS A ADRENO 200 GPU)
      
      6) 5 MP CAMERA WITH LED FLASH IS BETTER THAN WHAT YOU EXPECT ... PICS ARE MORE SIMILIAR WITH S3 ...  1.3 MP FRONT CAMERA IS DECENT FOR SKYPE CALLS... (S DUOS JUST HAS A VGA FRONT CAMERA)
      
      7) 768 MB RAM IS DECENT YET 1 GB COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER ...
      
      8) 4 INCH SCREEN ( GREAT MOVIE EXPERIENCE)
      
      9) BUILD QUALITY IS NICE IF NOT THE BEST AND CERTAINLY NOT POOR...
      
      10) WIFI, 3G AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IS VERY SMOOTH...
      
      11)FINALLY FOR ALL THOSE BRAND CONSCIOUS FREAKS - SAMSUNG ...
      
      
      CONS -
      
      1) PHONE SLIGHTLY LAGS AFTER JELLYBEAN UPDATE... ITS NOT AN ISSUE WITH THIS PHONE... ITS THE ISSUE WITH JELLYBEAN 4.1.2 ... EVEN S3 LAGS AFTER JELLYBEAN UPDATE... YET HARDWARE RESET SOLVED MOST OF MY LAG ISSUE...
      
      2) LOUD SPEAKER VOLUME IS SOMEWHAT LOW BUT SPEAKERBOOST APP SOLVES YOUR PROBLEM...
      
      3) DOESN'T SUPPORT USB OTG (NOT A BIG PROBLEM ALREADY 16+32 GBS OF MEMORY)
      
      4) BATTERY BACKUP COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER YET JUICE DEFENDER OR 2X BATTERY SAVER APP SOLVES THE ISSUE...
      
      5) HEADPHONES ARE OF CHEAP QUALITY... WHO CARES ?? BUY PHILIPS SHE1360/97 HEADPHONE... GREAT FOR THIS PHONE WITH AWESOME BASS ...
      
      6) NOT A DUAL SIM PHONE (ONLY ADVANTAGE OF S DUOS)
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT -
      
      BLINDLY GO FOR IT ... ITS MONEY WORTH THAN 25K PHONES ... CLEARLY BEATS HTC ONE V , XPERIA SOLA AND CANVAS HD IN ALL FIELDS ... DON'T TAKE A WRONG DECISION BY BUYING OTHER BRAND PHONES AND WASTING TIME IN SEARCH OF SERVICE STATIONS ..."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I RECEIVED THIS PHONE AFTER 6 DAYS OF ORDER.
      
      GOOD PERFORMANCE, GOOD SCREEN , AVERAGE BATTERY LIFE.

      NO CAMERA KEY"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"IF YOU DO A FACTORY RESET JUST BEFORE AND AFTER INSTALLING THE JB OR ANY OTHER MAJOR UPDATE, EVERYTHING'LL BE FINE.
      
      MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BACKED UP ALL YOUR DATA BEFORE DOING SO.
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS AWESOME AT 14000 PRICE BAND.
      
      NO OTHER COMPANY IS GIVING AWAY A DUAL CORE A9 AT THIS PRICE AND OTHER FEATURES.
      
      ONLY LUMIA 620 MATCHES THE HARDWARE AND SPECS WITH ITS DUAL CORE KRAIT.
      
      OTHER COMPETITORS :
      
      
      XPERIA U : LESS RAM, NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY,LESS INTERNAL MEMORY VGA FRONT CAM, BATTERY ISSUES, MEDIOCRE CAM.
      
      XPERIA GO : LESS RAM, LOW-RES SCREEN, BATTERY, NO FRONT CAM
      
      
      LG OPTIMUS L9 II: HIGH PRICE (17K), BUT BETTER CAMERA AND MORE RAM
      
      
      LUMIA 620 : BUYER'S CHOICE.. I CONSIDER WP A LIMITED OS. SO THAT IS A CON FOR ME. FAST PROCESSOR, LESS RAM(BUT ENOUGH FOR WP)
      
      
      TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:
      
      
      A9: 2.5 DMIPS/MHZ, WHEREAS A5: 1.6 DMIPS/MHZ
      
      DMIPS = DHRYSTONE MILLION INSTRUCTIONS PER SECOND.
      
      
      THEREFORE,A DUAL CORE A9 IS 160% FASTER THAN A DUAL CORE A5 AT SAME CLOCK SPEED(THAT'S WHAT ALL OTHER HANDSET AT THIS PRICE OFFER).
      
      
      PUTTING IT SIMPLER, 1GHZ A9 CORE = 1.5GHZ A5 CORE
      
      AND 1GHZ A9 CORE = 768 MHZ KRAIT CORE (KRAIT IS FASTER)
      
      AND 1GHZ A9 CORE = 1.2GHZ SCORPION CORE.
      
      MAKE THIS COMPARISON BEFORE MATCHING PRODUCTS WITH DIFFERENT CPU ARCHS.
      
      
      THE VERDICT:
      
      
      SO GUYS THIS IS THE BEST ANDROID DEAL AT 14K.
      
      SUPER AMOLED, MALI 400 GPU, HD RECORDING @30FPS, DLNA, 16 GIGS OF ONBOARD STORAGE (11.31GB + 2GB(APPS) = 13.31GB USABLE OUT OF 15GB, WHEN U CLEAR CACHE AFTER UPDATE THROUGH BOOT MENU, THEREFORE OS AND PREINSTALLED STUFF/TUTORIALS TAKES 1.7 GB SPACE).
      
      
      AND AFTER JELLYBEAN UPDATE, THE CAMERA WILL GET A 4X OPTICAL ZOOM TOO :) , U'LL GET THE FULLEST EXPERIENCE OF TOUCHWIZ, THANKS TO PROJECT BUTTER, AND ALSO THE WONDERFUL GOOGLE NOW.
      
      
      MAY 9TH 2013:
      
      RECEIVED WITHIN 24 HRS OF ORDERING (8 MAY'13) VIA COD.
      
      IT IS A MADE IN VIETNAM PIECE, MANUFACTURED IN MARCH'13, AND IMPORTED BY SAMSUNG INDIA IN MARCH, MRP IS 16300.
      
      
      MAY 10TH 2013:
      
      NO DEFECTS FOUND SO FAR! SOUND IS AWESOME!, GAMING TOO. TOO SNAPPY OF A DEVICE OF THIS PRICE. I'LL RUN GINGERBREAD FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE UPDATING TO JB.
      
      HOPE ITS NOT A DEFECTIVE ONE. OR ELSE I WONT GET A REPLACEMENT AS IT WILL BE OUT OF STOCK SOON. ALREADY OUT OF STOCK IN LOCAL MARKET IN PUNE. :(
      
      
      MAY 11TH 2013:
      
      COULDN'T RESIST TASTING JELLYBEAN ON THIS DEVICE, SO UPDATED IT VIA KIES TODAY. AS MENTIONED , I WIPED THE CACHE AND USER DATA BEFORE AND AFTER THE UPDATE.
      
      
      MAY 13TH 2013:
      
      AWESOME IS THE WORD FOR THE PERFORMANCE AFTER JB UPDATE. ALL HIGH-GRAPHICS GAMES RUN SO SMOOTH ON THE DEVICE. BUT THERE ARE SOME LAGS IN GOOGLE NOW.
      
      SAMSUNG'S TOUCHWIZ NATURE UX IS BEAUTIFUL, FEATURE PACKED, YET SIMPLE. FAR BETTER THAN THE SENSELESS HTC SENSE OR THE SONY'S TIMESCAPE.
      
      KEEP IN MIND THAT EXITING AN APP WITH BACK BUTTON STILL KEEPS IT RUNNING SO MAKE USE OF TASK MANAGER TO KILL THE USELESS APPS. RESTARTING THE DEVICE IN THE MID-DAY WOULD BE A GREAT BOOST FOR PERFORMANCE.
      
      AFTER INSTALLING 50+ APPS WITH APPS LIKE FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP, GOOGLE NOW, GMAIL, NIMBUZZ ETC ETC RUNNING IN BACKGROUND, IT SHOWS 465MB OF RAM USED AT STARTUP OUT OF 625 MB AVAILABLE. WHICH IS PRETTY DECENT. I HAVE NEVER SEEN USED RAM GO BEYOND 600 MB EVEN AFTER RUNNING 10+ APPS INCLUDING A GAME.
      
      
      MUSIC OUTPUT IS MIND-BLOWING. SPECIALLY THE VIRTUAL 7.1 PRESET. (GINGERBREAD HAD ONLY 5.1 CH. VIRTUALIZATION). LOUDSPEAKER PERFORMANCE IS JUST AVERAGE(LOW VOLUME).
      
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD FOR GENERAL PHOTOGRAPHY. DON'T EXPECT GREAT LANDSCAPES OR EXTREME LOW LIGHT PHOTOS TO LOOK GREAT. FLASH IS AVERAGE IF NOT GREAT. ISO RANGES FROM 50(IN FIREWORK AND SPORTS PRESET) TO 400, BUT MANUALLY YOU CAN SELECT BETWEEN 100, 200 AND 400. FOR BEST RESULTS IN LOW LIGHT USE HIGH ISO AND STANDARD EXPOSURE. IT WILL PRODUCE NOISY PICTURES, BUT POST PROCESSING SOFTWARE CAN REMOVE THE NOISE EASILY WITH NEGLIGIBLE LOSS OF DETAIL.
      
      VIDEO RECORDING HAS DECENT FRAME RATE BUT LIL BIT NOISE CREEPS IN IN LOW LIGHT. BUT HEY THATS OK AS ALL OTHER A5 HANDSETS ONLY GIVE 480P RECORDING.
      
      NO LAGS IN KEYBOARD EVER NOTICED.
      
      
      YOU ALSO GET SOME GALAXY SIII'S MOTION FEATURES LIKE DIRECT CALL, PAN ZOOM AND SCROLL, MOTION UNLOCK ETC, AND ALSO THE OLD AND GOOD TURN OVER TO MUTE AND SHAKE TO UPDATE,  WHICH ARE DECENT ADDONS.
      
      
      GPS TAKES LOCK IN A MINUTE OR SO. AND IS PRETTY ACCURATE, WITH LESS THAN 2 SECONDS DELAY IN TURN BY TURN NAVIGATION.
      
      
      UNDOUBTEDLY YOU GET THE BEST DISPLAYS AT 14K WITH THIS PHONE. IT BRINGS ALL OTHER DISPLAYS TO SHAME, WHETHER IS IPS OF LG OR CLEARBLACK OF LUMIA 620 OR SONY BRAVIA, NONE CAN BEAT SAMSUNG'S SUPER AMOLED IN THIS PRICE RANGE. THE PHONE HAS GREAT SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY, THANKS TO THE SIMPLICITY OF THE NATURE UX TOO.
      
      
      YET TO CHECK BATTERY LIFE ON CELL RADIO, BUT ON CONTINUOUS SURFING/DOWNLOADING OVER WIFI, IT LASTS FOR 10+ HOURS, WITH OCCASIONAL GAMING AND MUSIC, WHICH IS PRETTY GREAT FOR A 1500MAH RUNNING A DUAL CORE A9.
      
      
      MAY 14TH 2013:
      
      OMG PRICES SLASHED. IM IN A LOSS :P. HAD I WAITED FOR A WEEK I WOULD HAVE SAVED RS 800 :("
Galaxy S Advance,5,"I'M WRITTING A REVIEW NOW BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH IMPORTANT REVIEWS ARE. I HAD TAKEN A PURCHASE DECESION AFTER GOING THRU REVIEWS ONLY. I MUST SAY THAT ""GOING THRU REVIEWS"" IS NOT AN EASY TASK AT ALL, AS YOU WILL FIND REVIEWS ON BOTH THE SIDES...(+ &AMP; - )
      
      
      I WANTED A BRANDED SMART PHONE WITH DUAL CORE PROCESSOR. I REVIEWED SONY EXPERIA-U &AMP; EXPERIA-J, MICROMAX CANVAS HD FOR COMPARISON WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY ADVANCE.I ALSO CHECKED WITH GSMARENA FOR COMPARISON. ALSO VISITED SONY &AMP; SAMSUNG OUTLETS RO PHYSICALLY CHECK THE PHONES.
      
      
      AFTER ALL THE TECHNICAL &AMP; PHYSICAL COMPARISON, I FOUND THAT SAMSUNG GALAXY ADVANCE @ BELOW 15K IS MUCH MORE SUPERIOR TO PEERS WITH DUAL CORE CORTEX A9 PROCESSOR, SUPER AMOLED &AMP; LARGE SCREEN, MALI-400 GRAPHICS, 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY WITH 32 GB EXPANDABLE EXTERNAL MEMORY..THE ONLY DRAWBACK I FOUND IS IT'S OS - GINGERBREAD, WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS UPGRADABLE TO ANDROID 4.1 JELLY BEAN OS.
      
      
      AFTER SOME HESITATION IN MIND AND QUICK CONFIRMATION FROM FLIPCART ABOUT 30 DAYS REPLACEMENT WARANTEE, I FINALLY DECIDED TO GO FOR SAMSUNG S ADVANCE. I GOT THE DELIVERY IN TIME AND FOUND THE PACKING OK AND OVERALL IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH FLIPKART..WORTH TO RECOMMEND..AWESOME PHONE..IT'S TOUCH SCREEN OPERATES VERY SMOOTHLY..IF YOU WANT A NICE &AMP; BRANDED SMART PHONE BELOW 15K, JUST GO FOR IT...
      
      I GIVE 10/10 HERE..TO FLIPKART &AMP; SAMSUNG BOTH..!!"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"IN THE PRICE RANGE OF 14K THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT.
      
      
      I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY FRIEND WHO WANTED AN ECONOMIC MOBILE WITH BETTER PROCESSING SPEEDS. ALSO ADVANCE IS GETTING JELLY BEAN 4.1.2 UPDATE SHORTLY THAT WOULD MAKE IT UP TO DATE WITH THE ANDROID OS.
      
      
      I OWN A GALAXY S3 THAT ALSO HAS A MALI 400 GPU.
      
      
      THE ONE FOUND ON THE S ADVANCE IS A 1 GHZ DUAL-CORE ARM CORTEX-A9 PROCESSOR AND SINGLE CORE ARM MALI 400 MP GPU WITH LP-DDR2 MEMORY MODULE ON A NOVATHOR U8500 CHIPSET.
      
      
      I TRIED SEVERAL GAMES ON IT AND IT WAS QUIET FASTER. THE GMAIL APP ON THE GINGER BREAD HAD SOME ISSUES, BUT OVERALL IT IS A FASTER PIECE OF DEVICE."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"ITS NICE BUT PRICE IS TOO MUCH... -_-
      
      I WAS CONFUSED WHETHER TO TAKE MOTO ATRIX 2 OR S ADVANCE.THE REASON WHY I WENT WITH S ADVANCE IS THAT DUE TO LACK OF PROPER SUPPORT FROM MOTO IN INDIA(SAMSUNG ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME IN INDIA AND ARE RELEASING PHONES EVEN BEFORE US) AND 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY.
      
      
      BUILD QUALITY:
      
      IT IS USUAL SAMSUNG DESIGN,MAY BE ALL PLASTICKY BUT VERY LIGHT WEIGHT,AND THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT GRIP AND LITTLE SLIPPERY ON THE SIDES(AN CASE WOULD SOLVE THIS AND OF COURSE YOU WOULD DEFINITELY BUY A CASE TO PROTECT YOUR NEAR 20000 BUBBLE).
      
      EXCEPT THE HOME BUTTON ALL PHYSICAL BUTTONS ARE HAVING GOOD TACTILE RESPONSE AND ARE PLACED WELL.
      
      NOTICE THAT 3.5MM AUDIO JACK IS PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HANDSET AND SOMETIMES IRRITATES WHEN YOU ARE LISTENING MUSIC YOU NEED TO KEEP THE PHONE IN BOTTOM UP POSITION AND THEN IF SOME NOTIFICATION COMES UP AND WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT YOUR POCKET AND YOU WILL BE CONFUSED A LITTLE.
      
      
      TOUCH RESPONSIVENES:
      
      AS EXPECTED FROM SAMSUNG,DELIVERS THE GOODS.
      
      
      NO CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WITH EITHER NETWORK(DIDN'T USE 3G) OR WIFI.
      
      
      DISPLAY:
      
      AT THIS PRICE RANGE,THE BEST DISPLAY YOU WILL GET.
      
      BUT THE SUNLIGHT VISIBILITY CAN BE IMPROVED(EVEN WITH FULL BRIGHTNESS,THE DISPLAY SEEMS TO BE DIM,TYPICAL OF AMOLED DISPLAY).
      
      INDOORS ZERO BRIGHTNESS IS ENOUGH.
      
      
      SOUND:
      
      FORGET THAT EXTERNAL SPEAKER IS THERE,THE OUTPUT IS VERY LOW.
      
      THE PROVIDED EARPHONES ARE GOOD,MAY NOT HAVE BASS,BUT CLARITY IS NICE.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE:
      
      ANDROID 2.3 RUNS WITHOUT ANY ISSUES.HAVE DOWNLOADED MANY APPS BUT DIDN'T LAG AT ALL,TILL THE USER ACCESSIBLE 512 MB RAM IS FULL.
      
      I AM NOT MUCH INTO GAMES,BUT I PLAYED DEAD TRIGGER WITHOUT ANY ISSUES.IT'S GPU IS SAME AS THE S2.I SIDED WITH S ADVANCE BECAUSE THE PROCESSOR IS LATEST COMPARED TO ATRIX 2 OMAP 4430 AND NOVATHOR ARCHITECTURE ARE VERY SIMILAR TO EXYNOS.I AM SATISFIED WITH THE PROCESSOR AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE.
      
      PINCH TO ZOOM AND DOUBLE TAP ARE WORKING IN THE BROWSER WITHOUT ANY ISSUES.
      
      
      MULTIMEDIA:
      
      11 GB IS USER ACCESSIBLE,AND IT SPOILS YOU,IT SUPPORTS ALL MOST ALL CODECS.INSTALL MX PLAYER AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO WITH EVEN .WEBM FORMAT
      
      I DIDN'T CONVERT ANY VIDEOS AND I DIRECTLY COPIED THEM DIRECTLY AND PLAYS ALL 720P WITHOUT ANY HICCUP,IF ANY FORMAT IS NOT SUPPORTED USE MX PLAYER SW DECODER(H/W DECODER SAVES YOUR BATTERY LIFE).
      
      WATCHING VIDEOS ON THIS SCREEN IS A JOY.
      
      DEFINITELY IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      GOOD PERFORMANCE IN SUNLIGHT.
      
      MEETS THE EXPECTATION
      
      THERE IS NO ZOOM FUNCTIONALITY(MIGHT BE RECTIFIED WITH THE NEXT FIRMWARE UPDATE..SAMSUNG HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO UPDATE THE PHONE TO ICS,ALREADY JELLY BEAN IS OUT THERE)
      
      
      BATTERY:
      
      DON'T EXPECT MIRACLES HERE,IT CAN LAST ONE AND HALF DAY OF MODERATE USAGE.ON SYNC CONTINOUSLY IN 2G,IT WAS DOWN TO 30 TO 35% FROM MORNING 8:00 TO EVENING 8:00.I USED 2X BATTERY SAVER AND IT IMPROVED BATTERY PERFORMANCE A LOT.
      
      
      MISC:
      
      I DIDN'T FIND ANY PAGE IN XDA FOR THIS DEVICE,AND STILL NOT POPULAR IN THE MODDING COMMUNITY,GIVEN THE PROCESSOR CAPABILITY DEFINITELY MODDING WILL START FOR THIS PHONE).
      
      IF YOUR HAVING A WIFI CONNECTION DOWNLOAD DROPBOX,AND INSTANT CAMERA UPLOAD IN DROPBOX IS AWESOME.
      
      I DIDN'T KEEP ANY MEMORY CARD,IT USES MTP TO CONNECT TO THE COMPUTER AND DON'T RELY ON KIES TO LOAD MULTIMEDIA ON TO THE PHONE,IT IS AS USUAL CRAPPY.JUST DRAG AND DROP.
      
      
      I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"JELLY BEAN 4.1.2 FOR THIS PHONE HAS BEEN ROLLED OUT IN INDIA. HAPPY UPGRADING.
      
      
      I AM HAPPY THAT I HAD BOUGHT THIS PHONE. EVEN THE GRAND, WHICH IS MUCH COSTLIER, HAS A TFT WHEREAS THIS PHONE HAS AMOLED DISPLAY. NO OTHER SAMSUNG PHONE IN THIS RANGE HAS AN AMOLED DISPLAY."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"LONG AWAITED  JELLY BEAN UPDATE FOR S ADVANCE RELEASED . DOWNLOAD IT FROM SAMSUNG UPDATES, ENJOY CAMERA ZOOMING AND A LOT MORE FEATURES.AS OF NOW, I HAVEN'T UPGRADED THE INDIAN VERSION. BUT DONE WITH THE SERBIAN VERSION WHICH WAS RELEASED A MONTH AGO IS GOOD.
      
      
      HTTP://SAMSUNG-UPDATES.COM/DEVICE/?ID=GT-I9070"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"MOB WITH AWESOME CAMERA AND GREAT HANDLING.. TILL NOW NO PROBLEM FACED.. JELLY BEAN UPDATE GOT FEW BUGS SO THAT IS MAKING THE MOB SLOW ITS BETTER TO WAIT FOR NEXT RELEASE OF JB..
      
      GB OS SUITS MORE. SECONDARY CAMERA IS ALSO AWESOME FOR VIDEO CHAT AND ALL.. AFTER UPDATING TO JB IT MAY HANG B.CUZ OF RAM SIZE.."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"MY FIRST SAMSUNG PHONE....I WAS THINKING TO BUY MICROMAX A116 CANVAS HD BUT IN THE LAST MINUTE I DECIDED TO GO FOR THIS PHONE I DID THE RIGHT THING.....
      
      PROS-

      CONS-
      
      I'M A HEAVY USER HAVE TO CHARGE TWICE A DAY
      
      NO ZOOM OPTION IN CAMERA
      
      
      IF U R THINKING TO BUY A PHONE UNDER 20K JUST GO FOR IT.....IT IS BETTER THEN 21K GALAXY GRAND"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"NOW A DISCUSSION ABOUT SOME COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PHONE :
      
      1.	 HD VIDEO DOESN?T PLAY : DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL MX PLAYER FROM GOOGLE PLAY AND SWITCH THE MX PLAYER TO  SW DECODING MODE , YIPPEE YOU HAVE FULL HD 1920 X 1080 P VIDEO PLAYING ON THE S ADVANCE
      
      2.	 THE CAMERA DOSENT HAVE ZOOM FUNCTION: INSTALL CAMERAZOOM APP FROM GOOGLE PLAY AND \YOU GET ZOOM FUNCTION OR UPGRADE TO JELLY BEAN VERSION
      
      3.	THE PHONE CONNECTS AS  MTP DEVICE TO COMPUTER(SLOW COPY SPEED )
      
      GO TO SETTINGS&GT;WIRELESS AND NETWORKS&GT;USB UTILITIES&GT;CLICK CONNECT MASS STORAGE
      
      THE PHONE ASKS TO CONNECT CABLE TO PC, THEN THE NORMAL USB CONNECTION MODE GETS ENABLED AN D U CAN COPY FILES LIKE TO A PEN DRIVE, DON?T USE KIES SOFTWARE TO COPY FILES ITS JUST RUBBISH, USE NORMAL COPY PASTE AS IF TO A PEN DRIVE

Galaxy S Advance,5,"ORDERED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART ABOUT 10 DAYS AGO, RECEIVED IT IN 4 DAYS TIME. THE PACKAGING WAS VERY SECURE AND NICE, TOP-NOTCH. THE PHONE IS JUST AWESOME. GREAT FEATURES FOR AN INCREDIBLE PRICE. REALLY A VALUE FOR MONEY PHONE. PERSONALLY I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY NETWORK PROBLEMS TILL NOW. ALSO, THE OFFICIAL JB UPDATE FOR THIS PHONE IS NOW AVAILABLE, THOUGH I PREFER NOT TO UPDATE IT NOW.....I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE COMPLAINING THAT THE PHONE BECOMES SLOW AFTER JB UPDATE. RAM USE IS MORE, LAG PRESENT, I DON'T KNOW IF ITS TRUE.... FROM THE FEATURES, THIS IS LIKE A MINI S2 AT 10000 RUPEES LESS. I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THE PHONE. THIS PHONE HAS STOPPED PRODUCTION IN INDIA, ONLY LIMITED STOCKS AVAILABLE. GO FOR IT GUYS BEFORE THE STOCKS RUN OUT.  THANK YA FLIPKART FOR THE AWESOME DEAL AND GREAT SERVICE."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"PURCHASED THE DEVICE AT 13K WITH 500 DISCOUNT AS A PROMOTIONAL OFFER. THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR BRINGING THE PRICE DOWN AND DELIVERING THE PRODUCT WITHIN 48 HOURS. MY REVIEW IS SIMPLE AND BASED ON MY ANALYSIS.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. AMOLED. NO OTHER DEVICE COMES AT THIS PRICE WITH SUCH A SCREEN.
      
      2. A-9 DUAL CORE. VALUE FOR MONEY AT THIS PRICE. DIPMS IS HIGHER THAN A-5.
      
      3. MALI-400MP. GOOD FOR PLAYING GAMES. SAME GAMING PROCESSOR AS IN S3, NOTE 1 AND NOTE 2.
      
      4. 1.3 MP FRONT CAMERA. VALUE FOR MONEY FOR A PHONE AT 13000
      
      5. 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY. ALMOST 11 GB AVAILABLE FOR USAGE. GREAT AT THIS PRICE.
      
      6. SUPER SMOOTH AFTER UPGRADING TO JELLY BEAN. (DO REMEMBER TO FACTORY RESET BEFORE UPDATING VIA KIES)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. PRIMARY CAMERA AND LENS APERTURE IS NOT A REAL PERFORMER. HOWEVER, THE 5MP SHOOTER SERVES THE PURPOSE.
      
      2. RAM IS LOW. NOT SURE IF THE DEVICE FACE ANY ISSUE IN FUTURE UPDATES DUE TO THE LOW AVAILABILITY OF RAM.
      
      3. BATTERY IS 1500MAH. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF IT WAS SOMEWHERE NEAR TO 1650MAH.
      
      4. EXTERNAL SPEAKER QUALITY IS SOMEWHAT LOW.
      
      
      A BEAUTIFUL PRODUCT AT THIS PRICE. MUST GO FOR WHO ARE LOOKING A SMART PHONE BELOW 15K."
Galaxy S Advance,5,REALLY GREAT EXPERINCE IN BUYING THIS PHONE AS IT HAS A HUGE DISPLAY AND THE AMOLED DISPLAY GIVES VIBRANT CRISP PICTURES TREATING YOUR EYES. THE PHONE COMES WOTH ANDROID 2.3.6 BUT IS FULLY UPGRADABLE TO JELLY BEAN (4.1.2). THE ANDROID UPGRADE HAPPENS JUST LIKE A WHIP AS IT DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN CONNECTED TO PC THROU KIES SOFTWARE. WHILE THE PRICE IN OUSIDE MARKET IS 19K FOR THIS PHONE FLIPKART PRICE IS UNBEATABLE WITH FREE HOME DELIVERY. THE SHIPPING WAS DONE ON SAME DAY AND THE PHONE REACHED MY HANDS THE NEXT DAY ITSELF. OVERALL THE TRANSACTION AND THE PHONE FEATURES BOTH ARE SATISFACTORY.
Galaxy S Advance,5,"SIMPLY THE BEST PHONE MONEY CAN BUY IN INDIA
      
      RS 13500/- CAN NOT GIVE YOU MORE :)

      JUST GO BUY AND ENJOY IT :)
      
      
      THE SLEEK LOOK AND THE AMOLED DISPLAY IS THE MAIN ATTRACTION WITH A 5 MP CAMERA+ 1.3 MP SECONDARY CAM
      
      
      TRIED SKYPE ON IT AND IT WORKS FINE :)
      
      
      I LIKE THIS PRODUCT"

Galaxy S Advance,5,"THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR SPEEDY DELIVERY...

      BUT I SEE ITS BIT SLOW AFTER LOADING MEDIA FILES
      
      IT TAKES A WHILE TO OPEN MY FILES LIKE DCIM,DOWNLOADS ETC.
      
      PLS HELP TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"THE BEST PART OF THE PHONE IS THAT WE CAN UPGRADE THE ANDROID VERSION TO JELLY BEAN AND QUITE AN AFOORDABLE PRICE CANT ASK FOR MORE,GREAT PHONE.MOREOVER IT HAS A SECONDARY CAMERA OF 1.3 MP.SAMSUNG ROCKS"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"THIS ANDROID SMARTPHONE IS MY FIRST ANDROID DEVICE AND ITS GREAT.
      
      -THE TOUCH IS SMOOTH JUST LIKE AN APPLE DEVICE
      
      
      -THE PHONE COMES WITH GINGERBREAD AND THERE ARE NO LAGS WHATSOEVER
      
      
      -WITH MY 4 DAYS OF USAGE I HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY HANGS OR SHUT DOWNS
      
      
      -THE 5MP CAMERA IS SUPERB, TAKES NICE AND SHARP PICTURES, THE PICTURES LOOK VERY SHARP ON THE MOBILE BECAUSE OF THE SUPER AMOLED SCREEN, BUT ONCE TRANSFERRED ON COMPUTER U WILL NOTICE A COLOUR CHANGE, LIKE THE COLOUR FADES, BUT THE QUALITY IS NOT COMPROMISED, THE IMAGES ARE SHARP, ZOOM IS UNAVAILABLE IN GINGERBREAD BUT AVAILABLE IN JELLYBEAN UPDATE
      
      
      -THE LOUDSPEAKER IS GOOD, MUSIC OUTPUT ON THE SPEAKER IS VERY GOOD, AND THERE IS GOOD AMOUNT OF BASS IN THE EARPHONES PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG, THE SOUND IS CRYSTAL CLEAR
      
      
      -VIDEO RECORDING IS 720P HD AND DOES THE JOB WELL, THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS GOOD TOO
      
      
      -BATTERY IS GOOD, WITH MODERATE USE, AND WIFI ON THROUGHOUT IT LASTED 35HOURS, WHICH INCLUDED WEB BROWSING, 15-20 OF 2G CALLING, A FEW PICS AND VIDEOS, LIL MUSIC, INSTALLING OF APPS, TEMPLE RUN GAME, FACEBOOK AND FACEBOOK MESSENGER THROUGHOUT, DECENT BATTERY
      
      
      -MAPS AND GPS WORK GOOD, THE WIFI CONNECTS QUCIKLY AND HAS A GOOD RANGE, BLUETOOTH TRANSFERS ARE QUICK
      
      
      - THE AVAILABLE RAM IN GINGERBREAD IS 555 OUT OF WHICH 250-300 IS ALWAYS FREE. BUT WHEN U UPGRADE IT TO JELLYBEAN THE RAM GOES UPTO 625 (I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH IS AVAILABLE FOR USE AS I HAVE NOT UPDATED IT TO JELLYBEAN YET BUT I HAVE READ IT ON THE INTERNET)
      
      
      -THE SECONDARY CAMERA WHICH IS 1.2MP IS GOOD AND VIDEO CALLING ON SKYPE IS FUN
      
      
      -THE BUILD OF THE PHONE IS DECENT BUT THE BACK BATTERY PANEL IS VERY THIN, THE PHONE ITSELF IS VERY LIGHT, A SCRATCH GUARD AND A HARD BACK COVER IS A MUST
      
      
      -I DID FIND THE NETWORK ISSUE WHEN THE NETWORK WAS ON DUAL MODE, AFTER A CALL THE NETWORK WOULD GO BLANK FOR 5SECS AND COME BACK, BUT NEVER GOT DISCONNECTED DURING THE CALL, SO THE SWITCHED TO GSM ONLY MODE AND SINCE THEN THERE IS NO ISSUE WHATSOEVER
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT:
      
      A VERY GOOD ANDROID PHONE, ITS THE BEST PHONE IN THE 10K-16K PRICE RANGE, FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE BIG PHONES WITH HUGE DISPLAYS CAN BUY LG L9 AND HTC LOVERS CAN BUY DESIRE X, BUT THIS SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE IS BETTER THAN THE LG AND HTC MODELS I JUST MENTIONED.
      
      MAJORITY OF THE SONY XPERIA MODELS IN THIS PRICE RANGE HAVE 3.5INCH SCREEN AND JUST 512MB RAM, SO ITS BETTER TO BUY SAMSUNG."
Galaxy S Advance,5,THIS IS  A GREAT HANDSET SPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO GIFT SOMEONE. AFTER COUPLE OF DAYS OF PURCHASE IT RECEIVED THE JELLYBEAN UPDATE(4.1.2) VIA KIES. NOW IT RUNS SMOOTH WITH AN IMPROVED GAMING PERFORMANCE.
Galaxy S Advance,5,"THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID AND FIRST TOUCHSCREEN. ITS AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!!!
      
      PROS: AS EVERYONE LISTED
      
      CONS: I FEEL LESS BATTERY 1650MAH WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.
      
      
      REGRADING THE JB UPDATE.
      
      THERE ARE MIXED REVIEWS. SOME SAYS IT LAGS, SOME SAYS ITS LIKE BUTTER. CANT DECIDE WHETHER TO GO FOR UPDATE OR NOT.
      
      
      ITS A REALLY SUPERB DEVICE AT 13K."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"THIS IS THE BEST POSSIBLE CONFIGURATION U CAN FIND AT THIS PRICE RANGE COMPARED WITH SOME QUALITY PRODUCTS GIVING BRANDS (SONY/SAMSUNG/HTC..) AND SOME REVIEWER HAS SAID THERE IS NO XDA PAGE FOR THIS MODEL - BUT THERE IS A PAGE IN XDA AND LOTS OF DEVELOPMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS ARE DONE THERE (U HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THAT) , NOW ANDROID 4.1.2 IS OFFICIALLY RELEASED FOR THIS - UPDATE VIA SAMSUNG KIES, THE ONLY MISSING THING IS USB OTG FACILITY TO CONNECT PENDRIVES DIRECTLY TO MOBILE..."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"THIS PHONE COMES AT A KILLER PRICE AND OFFERS ALL THE FEATURES ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM A MID RANGE DEVICE. THE DISPLAY IS REALLY NICE (SUPER AMOLED) AND THE BATTERY LIFE IS DECENT(ROUGHLY 24HRS WITH MODERATE INTERNET USE). MALI 400 GPU IS GOOD AND SO IS THE DUAL CORE PROCESSOR. THE PHONE OPERATES VERY SMOOTHLY.
      
      
      FURTHERMORE THIS DEVICE CAN NOW BE OFFICIALLY UPGRADED TO JELLYBEAN (ANDROID 4.1.2) ON SAMSUNG KIES (YOU'LL NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE UPDATED KIES SOFTWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER FROM THE SAMSUNG WEBSITE AND LINK YOUR PHONE WITH THE USB CABLE AND THEN UPDATE AS SAMSUNG DOESN'T PROVIDE OVER THE AIR UPDATES). THE PHONE OPERATES EVEN SMOOTHER NOW AFTER UPDATING."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"THIS PHONE HAS AN AMAZING DISPLAY AND IS VERY LIGHT. IT STILL RUNS GINGERBREAD AND HAS NO UPDATE AVAILABLE FOR INDIA. BUT SOME REVIEWS SUGGEST THAT AN UPDATE FOR UK IS AVAILABLE. HAVEN'T CHECKED ON THAT YET. BUT STILL WITH THE GINGERBREAD IT'S NICE AND FAST.
      
      
      THE AMOLED DISPLAY IS GREAT AND THE DUAL CORE IS GREAT TO USE. IT IS VERY FAST AND RESPONSIVE. OVERALL, A VERY GOOD BUY FOR THIS PRICE."

      -----LOTS OF INTERNAL STORAGE(I GOT 13.8 GB ON MY GALAXY S ADVANCE)
      
      -----5 MP CAMERA AND 1.3 MP FRONT CAMERA AND THE BEST THING IS HD RECORDING (MANY PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEM WITH CAMERA BCOZ IT LACKED ZOOM BUT NOW AFTER UPGRADING MY ANDROID TO 4.1.2 THE CAMERA IS ABLE TO ZOOM)
      
      
      MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THIS PHONE LAGS A LOT BUT AFTER SINCE UPGRADING MY ANDROID I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY LAG
      
      
      AT LAST MY VERDICT IS THAT JUST BUY THIS PHONE AND DONT BELIEVE IN ANY OF THE BAD REVIEWS BCOZ THIS IS THE BEST PHONE YOU CAN GET TILL PRICE RANGE RS. 18,000."
Galaxy S Advance,5,"UPDATED TO JELLYBEAN. AND IT'S WORKING VERY FAST.EXCELLENT MOBILE WITH WITH EXCELLENT FEATURES.

      OR SOMEONE ELSE REQUEST THEM!!! WITH JELLYBEAN THIS IS THE BEST PHONE COMPARED TO ANY..!! GO FOR IT!!! :)"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"WAS CONFUSED BETWEEN THIS PHONE AND MICROMAX 116. CONSIDERING LONG TERM PERFORMANCE OF MMX, AND UNAVAILABILITY OF 116HD I OPTED FOR THIS.(MMX HAS ISSUES AFTER 3-4 MONTHS FOR SURE.)
      
      ALSO IT MMX 116 HAS 1.77 GB OF INTERNAL MEMORY (ARE U SERIOUS?), POWERPACKED PHN WITH LESS MEMORY SO THAT NO GAME MORE THAN 1.5 GB CAN LOAD?
      
      
      COMING TO THIS PHN,DUE TO A9 ARCHITECTURE(MMX116 USES A7) THIS IS SMOOTH AS BUTTER, NO LAGS,NO HANGS.CAMERA OF 5MP IS BETTER THAN MMX 8MP. AND THIS PHONE LOOKS BETTER THAN ITS PICTURE.
      
      GUYS ONE ADVICE,THIS PHN IS DISCONTINUED BY SAMSUNG HENCE ITS PRICE IS SLASHED. BUY IT,COZ U WUDNT GET A BETTER PHONE THAN THIS IN 14K.
      
      HEARD A LOT ABOUT NETWORK PROBLEMS, BUT I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY.
      
      
      21 MAY
      
      UPDATED TO JELLY BEAN,FACTORY RESET IS MUST.PERFORMANCE INCREASES ONLY LAG THAT IAM EXPERIENCING IS TEMPLE RUN 2, ELSE NO LAGS IN PHN(HONEST REVIEW)."
Galaxy S Advance,5,WORTH FOR PRICE..GREAT PERFORMANCE AFTER UPDATING TO JELLY BEAN..OVERA ALL A NICE PRODUCT FROM SAMSUNG........................................................................................................................................................................................NICEEEEEEEEE
Galaxy S Advance,5,"WOW!! FLIPKART IS THE BEST AND I LOVE THE PHONE ;)  ITS REALLY A AWESOME SMARTPHONE WHICH IS SMOOTH,CLEAR DISPLAY,GOOD PERFORMANCE AND YOU KNOW.....!!
      
      
      AGAIN HATS OFF FOR FLIPKART AND SAMSUNG ;)"
Galaxy S Advance,5,"YOU CAN FIND LG L9, XPERIA L, GALAXY S DUOS, HTC DESIRE X AND LG L7 IN THIS PRICE BRACKET....BUT NONE CAN OUTDO THE COMBINATION OF FEATURE  : PERFORMANCE : PRICE RATIO THIS DEVICE CAN GIVE.....TO START OFF WITH..THE 4"" SUPERAMOLED HAS VIRTUALLY NO COMPETITION FROM THE IPS LCDS OF THE COMPETITORS...THEN CHECK BENCHMARKS, CAMERA QUALITY, VIDEO RECORDING AND PLAYBACK QUALITY AND AUDIO QUALITY OF THE DEVICE FROM ANY NUMBER OF WEBSITES THAT HAS REVIEWED THIS PHONE..AND SOON YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BALANCED ALL-ROUNDER IN THIS PRICE RANGE....SURE IT DOESN'T HAVE NFC OR 1080P VIDEO RECORDING....ELSE THIS IS THE ULTIMATE MID-RANGE DEVICE...AND FOR GAMERS...GO CHECK OUT THE GAMING CAPABILITIES OF THIS DEVICE IN TONS OF VIDEOS UPLOADED AT YOUTUBE...."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"1. COMES WITH ANDROID V2.3 (GINGERBREAD) OS AND IT'S GOOD AS COMPARED TO WINDOWS 8 OS.
      
      2. THE TOUCH SCREEN PERFORMANCE IS QUITE GOOD.
      
      3.BATTERY BACKUP IS QUITE GOOD.
      
      4. WON'T GIVE 5 RATINGS AS NOKIA HAS ALSO COME WITH SOME OF THE FANTASTIC FEATURES SAME AS THIS MOBILE IN LOWER PRICE RANGE"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"AFTER A LONG WAIT, I HAVE FOUND A GOOD AND EXCEPTIONALLY GREAT PHONE WITH MOST FEATURES ON BOARD FOR REASONABLE PRICE. JUST BUY IT AND FORGET IT :) I PROMISE ITS A STEAL.
      
      *:CAUTION:* ANDROID ADDICTION GUARANTEED"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"AS LIKE OTHERS I WAS ALSO IN SO MUCH DILEMMA TO GO WITH WHICH PHONE, AS MY SHORTLISTED PHONES WERE:
      
      1: DESIRE X
      
      2: XPERI SOLA
      
      3: S ADVANCE
      
      FINALLY AFTER SO MUCH RESEARCH AND COMPARISONS I BOUGHT S ADVANCE, AND  I MUST SAY THIS IS AN AMAZING DEVICE.
      
      SOME KEY FEATURES ARE LIKE IT HAS VERY SMOOTH UI AND VERY CRISP DISPLAY, IT HAS MORE THAN 300 MB RAM FREE ALL THE TIME AND HAVE 2GB MEMORY FOR INSTALLING APPS AND HAVE 11.31 GB STORAGE FOR DATA.
      
      SO WHEN I COMPARED THE THREE (S ADVANCE, XPERIA SOLA, DESIRE X) THE S ADVANCE APPEARED AS THE CLEAR WINNER COZ WHEN COMPARED WITH XPERIA SOLA THOUGH THE GPU AND CHIPSET WERE SAME BUT XPERIA SOLA WAS LACKING THE FRONT CAM, HAD SMALLER SCREEN, LOW RAM, LOW INTERNAL MEMORY, LOW BATTERY AS COMPARED TO THE S ADVANCE SO I DROPPED SOLA.
      
      THEN I COMPARED IT WITH DESIRE X THOUGH THEY HAD SOME SIMILARITIES LIKE SAME RAM SIZE, SAME SCREEN SIZE BUT THE CHIPSET AND GPU AND EVEN CPU (TWO CORE A5) WAS INFERIOR AS COMPARED TO S ADVANCE, AND ALSO DESIRE X WAS LACKING THE FRONT CAMERA AND HAD POOR VIDEO RECORDING RESOLUTION 480P AS COMPARED TO 720P OF S ADVANCE, AND HAD LOW INTERNAL MEMORY, THANKS TO THE HUGE 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY OF S ADVANCE.
      
      THE ONLY THING WHERE DESIRE X WAS WINNING WAS ON OS FRONT COZ IT WAS RUNNING THE LATEST JELLYBEAN WHILE S ADVANCE WAS STILL STUCK ON GINGERBREAD BUT IT WAS NOT AN ISSUE AS JELLYBEAN UPDATE FOR S ADVANCE IS ALSO ON THE CARDS AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE UPDATED. SO THE WISE CHOICE WAS TO GO WITH S ADVANCE RATHER THAN TO GO WITH THE SIMILARLY PRICED BUT INFERIOR DEVICES..
      
      I HOPE MY THIS REVIEW WILL HELP THE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"AWSOME PHONE..

Galaxy S Advance,4,"BEST MOBILE IN THIS PRICE RANGE AND FLIPKART DID IT AGAIN BY DELIVERING THIS MOBILE WITHIN 24HRS OF PLACING THE ORDER.
      
      
      PROS:

      CONS:
      
      1. BATTERY LIFE IS JUST A DAY
      
      2. AVAILABLE RAM IS ONLY 555 MB SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO EXCEED THE LIMIT BY LOADING MORE APS
      
      3. EAR PIECE VOLUME IS LITTLE LOW
      
      4. LOUDSPEAKER OUTPUT IS ALSO LOW"

      ABOUT THE PHONE: PRETTY NEAT, NICE BUILD ALTHOUGH THE BACK COVER IS WAY TOO THIN. BTW I AM UPGRADING TO JB TONIGHT. WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THE PHONE HANDLES THAT."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE 20 DAYS AGO. FIRST THING I DID WAS TO ROOT, INSTALL CWM, INSTALL A CUSTOM KERNEL AND INSTALL A CUSTOM ROM.! AND NOW THE PHONE RUNS GREAT. QUADRANT SCORE IS ABOUT 3000 TO 3100 AND NENAMARK2 SCORE IS 38-40 FPS.! CAMERA IS QUITE SLOW BUT TAKES GREAT SHOTS. PENTILE MATRIX ON SCREEN LOOKS A LITTLE OUTDATED AND PIXELATED.! REST EVERYTHING IS TOO GOOD.!"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"BRILLIANT SERVICE FROM FLIPKART. I HAVE ORDERED THE PRODUCT ON WEDNESDAY, THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY WAS WEEK LATER. BUT, I JUST GOT IN TWO DAYS.
      
      
      PROS AND CONS ABOUT THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      THIS PRODUCT HAS ALL THE PRO'S AS OTHER SAYS
      
      
      CONS
      
      THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT SO CATCHY OR ATTRACTIVE.
      
      
      THE PRICE IS BIT COSTLY (BUT AMOLED SCREEN, 1 GHZ PROS 768 MB RAM AND MALI400 MAKES IT TO SEEMS WORTH)
      
      
      THE BATTERY ENDURANCE IS NOT SO SATISFYING. ATLEAST ONE DAY ONCE YOU GOT TO PLUG IT.
      
      
      WIFI WORKING FINE WHEN CONNECTING TO ROUTER BUT COULDN'T CONNECT MY LAPTOP AND MOBILE THRU WIFI. TRIED ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OUT, STILL NO USE.
      
      
      ONLY GINGER BREAD AVAILABLE, ICS UPDATE IS NOT THERE, BUT NOT SURE THAT EVERY ONE SAYING THIS CAN BE UP-GRADABLE TO JELLY BEAN.
      
      
      THERE IS NO MAGIC IN THE HEADPHONES. NOT SO GOOD.
      
      
      ON THE WHOLE THE PRODUCT IS WORKING FINE.  LOVING IT."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"COMPARED IT WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND DUOS I9082 , SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS S7562,THIS IS BEST!!
      
      
      SUPER AMOLED SCREEN.... YOU WILL NOT GET ANY WITHIN 20,000 RANGE.
      
      SCREEN 4 INCHES COMPARED TO GRAND 5 INCHES, NOT A BIG DEAL...THIS IS HANDY!!
      
      PRIMARY CAMERA 5MP COMPARED TO 8MP OF GRAND..
      
      SECONDARY CAMERA 1.3MP COMPARED TO 2MP OF GRAND..
      
      WELL YOU DONT NEED THAT MUCH IN A MOBILE !!
      
      
      THOUGH RAM IS 768MB COMPARED TO 1GB OF GRAND.
      
      AND UPDATING ANDROID IS A MATTER OF NO PROBLEM!!
      
      BEING A SIMPLE USER, YOU WILL FIND VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
      
      THE DIFFERENT VERSION..
      
      AND DIFFERENCE OF COST BETWEEN THIS AND GRAND IS RS.6000.
      
      SO GO FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE I9070
      
      GIVE US CASHBACK...BRING BACK CASHBACK.... A SINCERE REQUEST TO FLIPKART .."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"DIDN'T EVEN TRY THE MOBILE WITH THE DEFAULT FIRMWARE. UPDATED TO OFFICIAL RUSSIAN ANDROID 4.1.2 XXLPZ JELLY BEAN AND LATER TO XXLQ4.
      
      COMPARED TO XXLPZ, I COULD SEE A SLIGHT INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE AFTER XXLQ4 UPDATE.
      
      APPS INSTALLED:
      
      DOLPHIN BROWSER, SKYPE, WHATSAPP, ADOBE READER, VLC PLAYER AND MANY OTHER.
      
      
      UPS:
      
      1. THE RIGHT SCREEN SIZE, IF YOU PREFER WORKING ON YOUR MOBILE WITH ONE HAND.
      
      2. GOOD QUALITY CAMERA WITH FLASH.
      
      3. MOTION SENSOR CAN BE USED FOR MUTING ETC.
      
      4. DISPLAY CLARITY IS VERY GOOD.
      
      5. GOOD BATTERY BACKUP
      
      
      DOWNS:
      
      1. COMES LOADED WITH GINGERBIRD.
      
      2. SAMSUNG DOES NOT HAVE AN ORIGINAL FLIP COVER FOR THIS MODEL. BUT THERE ARE CHEAP DUPLICATES AVAILABLE. BOUGHT MINE FOR 350 + SHIPPING
      
      3. DISPLAY BRIGHTNESS AT SUNLIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
      
      
      IF YOU NEED ANDROID PHONE AT THIS PRICE RANGE AND ARE READY FOR DOING THE UPDATE YOURSELF, THEN THIS IS THE PHONE FOR YOU. MOREOVER FLIPKART GAVE A 16GB MICRO SD CARD FOR FREE.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE COMPARING WITH HTC AND SONY DEVICES IN THIS PRICE RANGE, HAVE A LOOK AT THEIR USER REVIEW ONLINE. BOTH OF THEM HAVE RELIABILITY ISSUES. FEATURES MIGHT BE SAME, NOT BETTER."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"FEATURES WISE
      
      PRICE WISE
      
      LOOK WISE
      
      I CAN SAY IT IS AWESOME PHONE....
      
      NICE PERFORMANCE...GOOD OPTIONS...MAINLY FOR BUDGET LOVERS..IT IS VERY GOOD..NO OTHER BRAND PROVIDING THESE MANY FEATURES IN THIS PRICE....
      
      THANKS FLIPKART FOR QUICKEST DELIVERY...NEXT DAY ONLY I GOT PHONE...
      
      THAT TOO ZERO FEE FOR 6 MONTHS EMI...SUPER...."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"FIRST THE PRICE OF THIS PRODUCT IS PRICED HIGHER THAN OTHER ONLINE SITES.. SECOND THE PRODUCT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN ALMOST ALL RETAIL STORES AS IT IS A FAILURE...
      
      THE REASON FOR THE FAILURE IS THAT THE STOCK KERNEL, FOR JB, OF THIS PHONE IS PRETTY MUCH A MESS, SUDDEN LAGGGGGG AND HANGS EVEN WHEN NOT USING GPU INTENSIVE PROCESSES.
      
      
      YOU CAN REMOVE IT BY FLASHING A CUSTOM KERNEL... SOME REALLY GOOD KERNELS ARE AVAILABLE AT XDA...
      
      
      IMPORTANT: DISABLE GOOGLE NOW AND OTHER BLOATWARES THAT WILL NOT USE AS THEY ARE THE VERY REASON FOR HANGS IN THE STOCK VERSION
      
      
      OTHER THAN THESE CONS THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MODEL WITH LOTS OF POWER THAT U CAN GET FOR 13K (IN OTHER ONLINE STORES) FROM  A BRANDED COMPANY LIKE SAMSUNG..."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"FIRST THING ABOUT MY SATISFACTIONS IS THE WAY FLIPKART DELIVERS THE THINGS...
      
      
      I ORDERED THIS AMAZING PHONE ON 2ND JUNE 2013 @ 3 PM IST AND BELIEVE ME OR NOT, I GOT IT ON 3RD JUNE 2013 AT 3:40 PM IST.
      
      
      REGARDING THE PHONE ""SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE""... EVERYTHING IS SUPERB.. JUST EXPECTING AN ICS UPDATE.."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"FIRSTLY GREAT SERVICE BY FLIPKART... ORDERED FOR THE PHONE ON 3RD GOT IT ON THE 4TH...
      
      
      THE PHONE IS GOOD... ITS PERFORMANCE CANNOT BE COMPARED TO SAMSUNG GRAND OR EVEN MICROMAX CANVAS HD.. EVEN THE ANDROID OS 2.3.6 IS A MAJOR DRAWBACK.. HOWEVER IN ITS PRICE RANGE ITS A VERY SMART CHOICE..
      
      
      THE PHONE POWERED WITH ITS CORTEX A-9 PROCESSOR AND 555 MB USABLE RAM PROVIDES A VERY SMOOTH EXPERIENCE.. I CAN SAY THAT TEMPLE RUN 2 WORKS SMOOTHLY WITHOUT ANY LAG... AND IT IS A PLEASURE TO WORK THROUGH ALL YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND OFFICE DOCUMENTS.. BLUETOOTH IS PRETTY GOOD ALTHOUGH I DONT HAVE A STANDARD TO CAMPARE IT WITH.. AS WELL AS THE WIFI...
      
      
      THE MAJOR FEATURE OF THE PHONE IS THE SUPER AMOLED SCREEN... IT IS REALLY AWESOME... THE PHONE HAS VERY GOOD VIEWING ANGLES AND A SUBSTANTIAL BATTERY LIFE... THE SCREEN IS ALSO GORILLA GLASS.. SO BETTER PROTECTION..
      
      
      THIS AS WELL AS THE 11.2 GB INTERNAL STORAGE AND SOME VERY GOOD PRELOADED APPS REALLY COMPLETE THE TOTAL PACKAGE
      
      
      ON THE WHOLE IT IS A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT A DECENT PHONE FROM AN ESTABLISHED SOURCE... HOWEVER THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER PHONES THAT FIT IN THIS PRICE RANGE AS WELL.. INCLUDING
      
      1. LG L9
      
      2. XOLO A1000, Q800 AND X900
      
      3. MICROMAX CANVAS HD
      
      4. HTC DESIRE X
      
      5. SONY XPERIA J
      
      
      HOWEVER I AM A VERY BIG FAN OF SAMSUNG.. THEIR AFTERSALES SERVICE IS VERY GOOD.. THEIR PRODUCTS DELIVER AND THEIR PHONES LOOK AMAZING.. SO I SAY GO FOR IT! :)"

Galaxy S Advance,4,"GOOD PHONE FOR UNDER 20K FOR ANDROID LOVERS. BEEN USING IT FOR A MONTH.

      ? LACK OF ZOOM IN CAMERA (HOPEFULLY, THE JB UPDATE WILL RESOLVE IT)
      
      ? MINOR LAGS IN THE OS AND GAMING (WONDER WHY DESPITE BEING DUAL-CORE)
      
      ? 3.5 JACK AT THE BOTTOM (MAJOR INCONVENIENCE)

      ? NETWORK DROPS AFTER EVERY CALL IN DUAL MODE (WORKS FINE WITH GSM ONLY MODE)
      
      ? 2.3 GINGERBREAD (NO CONCLUSIVE DATE WHEN THE UPGRADE TO JELLY BEAN IS DUE!!)
      
      ? SOUND ON SPEAKERS/HEADPHONES NOT IMPRESSIVE.

Galaxy S Advance,4,"GUYS THIS IS REALLY THE AWE-SUMEST PHONE IN MARKET NOW WITHIN 20K...GOT IT 1 WEEK AGO...!!!THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE AND I JUST LOVE IT....
      
      
      I GOT IT FROM FLIPKART 1 WEEK AGO....!!DELIVERED WITHIN 2 BUSSINESS DAYS....!!BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE HAV DONE A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH ON D PHONES AVAILABLE IN D MARKET..!!DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND MORE THAN 20K SO WITHIN THAT RANGE CHECKED A LOT MANY PHONES....AND THE PHONES THAT WERE ON MY LIST ARE BELOW:
      
      XPERIA SOLA,HTC DESIRE VC, S ADVANCE, S DUOS(SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR- SO EXCLUDED IT).
      
      
      BUT I SIMPLY LOVE SAMSUNG'S TOUCH WIZ.ITS CRISP AND HAS A VERY NICE CONTRAST AND EVEN IN BROAD DAY-LIGHT ITS GOOD.ONE OF MY ROOM MATES HAVE HTC SENSATION XE BUT I DIDN'T LIKE HTC SENSE.
      
      
      SECONDLY THE DESIGN OF S ADVANCE LOOKS REALLY GOOD AND IS HANDY.
      
      
      THIRDLY THOUGH U CAN'T USE THE VIDEO CALLING FACILITY NORMALLY BUT WITH SKYPE IT IS KIND OF EXCITING AND THE OTHER TWO DIDN'T HAVE IT.
      
      
      FOURTHLY, MANY PEOPLE DISCOURAGED ME ABOUT THIS PHONE SAYING THAT IT'S DISCONTINUED AND CAME WITH GINGERBREAD OUT OF THE BOX. BUT WHO CARES!! ITS STILL AWESUM WITH GINGER BREAD AND SERVICING ETC IS NOT A PROBLEM.
      
      
      THE BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO GOOD. I USE THE PHONE AT OFFC FOR BROWSING,ONLINE MAGAZINE AND NEWSPAPER READING,WHATS APP,GTALK ETC PURPOSES :P AND ALSO USE IT IN MY HOME WIRELESS NETWORK FOR HOURS BUT STILL IT SUSTAINS ENOUGH CHARGE AND TILL NOW HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PROBLEM OF HEATING UP ETC...WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING.
      
      
      HAVE INSTALLED AND PLAYED TEMPLE RUN. NO ISSUES/LAGS WHILE PLAYING THE SAME.
      
      
      HOWEVER I WUD LIKE TO POINT TO ONE THING HONESTLY.... NAVIGATING THRU THE HOME-SCREENS IS NOT VERY FAST LIKE THE SENSATION XE THOUGH MULTI-TASKING ETC DOESN'T LAGGS.WHILE I WAS DOWNLOADING SONGS I PLAYED TEMPLE RUN AND PLAYED SONGS.IT SEEMED AL-RIGHTY DEN.
      
      
      ALSO THE ABSENCE OF A DEDICATED KEY FOR THE CAMERA'S IS FELT AND SOUND QUALITY NOT EXTRA-ORDINARY.
      
      
      BUT FINALLY I WOULD SAY I SIMPLY LOVE THIS PHONE.WITHIN 20K ITS REALLY THE BEST AND HANDY AND GREAT TO LOOK AT.NO ISSUES TILL NOW AND WITH SOME COOL APPS TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY AND GREAT TO USE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS.

Galaxy S Advance,4,"GUYS... I GOT THIS PHONE NOT FROM FLIPCART IN OCT 2012.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS GOOD AS PER DISPLAY OR SAMSUNG UI..
      
      
      I HAVE ALL THREE TEMPLE RUN 1, 2 AND BRAVE AS WELL.  BUT NONE OF THEM RUN SMOOTHLY ON THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF RAM WHICH IS SAID TO BE 768 MB BUT ACTUALLY IT IS 555 MB, IT MEANS THIS PHONE HAS ONLY 512+43 MB RAM..
      
      
      MOREOVER REGARDING THE JB UPDATE, I WROTE TO SAMSUNG AND THEY CLEARLY WROTE BACK THAT NO JELLY BEAN HAS BEEN PLANNED FOR THIS.
      
      
      HERE I CONCLUDE THAT THE PHONE IS NOT REALLY WORTH THE PRICE...( BECAUSE YOU CAN GET ANY GINGER BREAD OS PHONE WITH 512 MB BELOW 10 K ..

Galaxy S Advance,4,"I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE PHONE SO WAS NOT WORRIED HOW IT WILL BE. THING I WAS WORRIED IS WOULD I GET THE PRODUCT IN RIGHT CONDITION OR NOT, FOR THAT I RELIED ON FLIPKART, AND THEY DELIVERED THE RIGHT PRODUCT WITH ONE YEAR OF MAUNFACTURER'S WARRANTY. PROPERLY PACKED AND DELIVERED SECURELY. PRICE WAS LOWEST OF ANYWHERE AVAILABLE(IMPRESSED). ONLY THING WAS THAT IT TOOK JUST FOUR HOURS TO REACH FROM BANGALORE TO MUMBAI, WHILE IT TOOK THREE DAYS TO REACH JUST FIFTEEN KILOMETERS WITHIN MUMBAI."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST 5 DAYS AND HAVE BEEN COMPARING IT WITH MY FRIENDS MOBILE.
      
      
      (+VE)
      
      1) IT IS A GOOD TO USE, SCREEN IS BIG ENOUGH FOR MESSAGE FREELY
      
      2) ENOUGH SPACE TO DOWNLOAD APPS
      
      3) CAN BE UPGRADED TO JELLYBEANS 4.1.2
      
      4) IT IS AS GOOD AS GALAXY S2
      
      
      (-VE)
      
      1) BATTERY IS NOT GOOD WHICH BRINGS DOWN THE AWESOME PHONE RATING. I DON'T' EXPECT IT TO BE GOOD AS IT IS SMART PHONE HOWEVER THE BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS BELOW AVERAGE.
      
      2) HARD TO FIND THE FLIP COVER FOR THIS.
      
      
      IF YOU DO PLAY GAMES, DO SPEND TIME ON INTERNET AND OTHER WORK THIS PHONE CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS JUST LIKE THOSE EXPENSIVE PHONES CAN JUST CARRY YOUR CHARGER COZ THE BATTERY DRAINS AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHON LAST WEEK .. N IT LOOKS N WORKS COOL... N AWSOME SERVICE BY FLIPKART .. GOT D PHON IN JUST 2 DAYS AFTA ORDRIN IT...
      
      SUPERB DISPLAY (AMOLED DISPLAY IS AWSOME), MOST F THE  GAMES N APPS RUNS PERFECTLY IN DIS PHON...BATTERY IS DESCENT.. BATTERY IS NOT MUCH GREATER AS I EXPECTED ... ONLY PRBLM IS JB UPDATE WE WE ALL ARE WATIN FOR D JELLY BEAN... HOPE WE ILL GET IT SOON.. NYWAY ITS A NICE PHON TO BUY FOR 15 K..AM LOVIN IT...AWSOME FLIPKART!! KEEP GOIN!!"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER 2 MONTHS RESEARCH,I FEEL VERY HAPPY TO GET THIS SMART DEVICE.
      
      
      1.AWESOME HD VIDEO RECORDING AND MOVIES.
      
      2.WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE BY LISTEING MUSIC WITH HEADSET.
      
      3.EXELLENT GRAPHIC CARD ITS GIVING BEST GAMES EXPERIENCE.
      
      4.EYE CATCHING DESIGN AND VERY SMOOTH TOUCH EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      IF SOMEONE WANTS TO BUY A WELL PERFORMANCED SMART DEVICE UNDER 15K....BLINDLY GO FOR IT."
Galaxy S Advance,4,I BROUGHT THIS PHONE AND IMMEDIATELY UPGRADED TO JELLYBEAN.IT IS AN AWESOME PHONE WITH ALMOST ALL FEATURES OF S3.JELLYBEAN HAS ENHANCED THE PERFORMANCE LIKE ANYTHING.THE FRONT AND REAR CAMERA QUALITY ARE VERY GOOD..THE AMOLED DISPLAY IS A VERY BIG ADD ON.THERE ARE TOO MANY FEATURES IN THIS PHONE WAITING TO BE DISPLAYED.ROCKING PERFORMANCE.A MUST POSSESS.
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I DID NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART HOWEVER, I HAVE BEEN USING IT SINCE 9 MONTHS. THIS IS A REALLY GOOD FOR AT THE CURRENT PRICE. THOUGH IT STILL IS WORKING AT THE OLD GEN ANDROID 2.3, IT STILL PACKS A PUNCH WHEN IT COMES TO PERFORMANCE IN THE BUDGET SECTION. TO TOP IT OFF THE 4"" SUPER AMOLED SCREEN IS A BOON AND REALLY BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH.
      
      
      I HAVE USED THIS PHONE AS A CAR CAMERA AS WELL AND IT IS QUITE ADEPT AT RECORDING HD VIDEO FROM A MOVING CAR EVEN IN EVENING LOW LIGHT.
      
      
      OVERALL I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I DON'T REALLY WRITE THE REVIEWS. BUT WHEN I HAD TO BUY A PRODUCT, REVIEWS WERE THE DEAL MAKER OR BREAKER. AFTER TWO WEEK OF USAGE, THIS IS MY TAKE ON S ADVANCE.
      
      
      DISPLAY: ITS SIMPLY FANTASTIC, EVEN MUCH HIGHLY PRICED PHONES LIKE GALAXY GRAND IS NOWHERE NEAR IT.
      
      
      BUILD QUALITY: DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST MADE DEVICE IN THE MARKET. I DROPPED THIS PHONES WHILE RIDING ON THE BIKE, STILL THE PHONE ESCAPED WITH JUST ONE SCRATCH. TRULY AMAZING!!
      
      THIS PHONE HAS PREMIUM FEELING WHICH EVEN SOME OF THE MUCH HIGHER PRICED PHONE LAGS. SAMSUNG HAD DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB ON THIS.
      
      
      SOFTWARE: IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO WANT TO HAVE PHONE FOR SOME BROWSING AND LITTLE BIT OF LOW END GAMING, ITS A GREAT CHOICE. ANDROID 4.1.2 JB WILL SIMPLY BLOW YOUR MIND. ITS SO MUCH BETTER THAN ITS PREDECESSORS. HOWEVER IT MAY MARGINALLY SLOW DOWN YOUR DEVICE.
      
      ON THE OTHER SIDE, IF YOU ARE A HARDCORE GAMER, I GUESS YOU MUST BE READY TO SPEND ANOTHER 12K AND GET NEXUS 4(I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT). IN FACT EVEN A SIMPLE 3D GAMES LIKE SUBWAY SURFER, TEMPLE RUN 2 SKIPS SOME FRAME AT TIMES.(BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS CLOSE ALL THE APPS, STOP BATTERY SAVING AND HAVE A MUCH BETTER GAMING EXPERIENCE). HOWEVER, 2D GAMES ARE VERY SMOOTH.
      
      
      CALL QUALITY: THE VOICE IS CLEAR AND THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNAL ISSUES. ITS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL FEATURE OF THE PHONE AND GOOD TO SEE SAMSUNG HAS NOT OVERLOOKED AT IT.
      
      
      BATTERY: IT CAN EASILY LAST A DAY EVEN AFTER A VERY EXTENSIVE USAGE. NO COMPLAINTS WHATSOEVER.
      
      
      CAMERA: WELL, IT ISN'T BAD BY ANY MEAN, BUT DONT EXPECT A LOT ON THIS FRONT EITHER. ITS FAIRLY DECENT I MUST SAY.
      
      
      VERDICT:
      
      WELL, I AM AN APP DEVELOPER MYSELF. ALL I CAN SAY IS JUST DON'T BOTHER YOURSELF BY LOOKING AT THE SPECS OF ALL THE PHONES. IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT GRAB A MICROMAX. ITS THE OVERALL PACKAGE WHICH MATTERS. AND I MUST SAY, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SMARTPHONE AT ANY PRICE POINT AND YOU ARE NOT A HARDCORE GAMER, AND 4 INCH SCREEN SIZE CAN FILL YOUR APPETITE , GO FOR IT."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I GAVE IT 4.
      
      
      PROS
      
      GOOD PHONE
      
      EXCELLENT QUALITY
      
      NICE LOOKS,
      
      GOOD LARGE SCREEN,
      
      HD IS GOOD,
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD TOO,
      
      16 GB INTERNAL SPACE (MORE THAN ENOUGH) 90% OF THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE MORE THAN 4 GB SD CARD IN THEIR PHONES.
      
      
      HOWEVER THE ONLY DISTURBING FACTOR IS, ZOOM IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR CAMERA :)) SURPRISING.
      
      WHAT THE MANUFACTURER THOUGHT WHILE CREATING THIS PHONE.
      
      
      OVERALL EXPERIENCE IS EXCELLENT, I STUDIED ALOT BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE AND WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND A BETTER OPTION IN THIS PRICE TAG.
      
      
      THOUGH THIS IS NOT THE FORUM FOR SUGGESTING PEOPLE ON WHAT TOO BUY...HOWEVER JUST CONSIDER SIZE OF THE PHONE TOO BIGGER THAN THIS PHONE IS NOT A GOOD IDEA, CARRYING A BIG PHONE IS A TROUBLE...UNLESS YOU CARRY A LADIES LARGE HANDBAG... :)
      
      
      HAPPY TELEPHONY."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I GOT ROBBED OF MY SAMSUNG GALAXY SII A FEW MONTHS AGO, SO I WANTED TO BUY SII AGAIN AS I WAS USED TO IT. BUT IT WENT OFF THE MARKET AND MY BUDGET WAS ALSO LESS. AND GUESS WHAT I GOT A VERY SIMILAR PHONE FOR A MUCH MUCH LESSER PRICE!!"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I GOT THIS MOBILE IN JUNE 2013 AFTER REVIEWING IT FOR A WEEK WITH ITS PROS AND CONS. I BOUGHT IT WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER IT WAS RELEASED IN CHENNAI FROM A DIRECT DEALER.
      
      1. SCREEN QUALITY IS DAMN GOOD IN THIS PRICE. IT HAS GOT SUPER AMOLED BETTER THAN LED DISPLAY.
      
      2. SPEAKER IS NOT THAT MUCH BUT WE CAN HEAR THE VOICE OUTSIDE WHEN YOU HAVE SWITCHED NOT LOUDSPEAKER.
      
      3. IT HAS DUAL CAMERA FOR THE VIDEO CALLING WHICH IN INDIA IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH PACKET DATA, ONLY WITH FAST WIFI ON BOTH MOBILES ITS POSSIBLE. REAR CAMERA HAS NO ZOOM BUT HAS AUTOFOCUS. FRONT CAMERA IS 1.3 MP, WHICH IS GOOD FOR SELF RECORDING. REAR CAMERA HAS LED FLASH ALSO.
      
      4. DEFAULT SAMSUNG LAUNCHER IS NOT GOOD WHEN COMPARED TO SONY AND GO LAUNCHER AND LAUNCHER 7. U NEED TO DOWNLOAD ANY OF THE LAUNCHERS FROM PLAY STORE.
      
      5. THE NOTIFICATIONS IS BETTER WHEN COMPARED TO OTHERS WHERE WE CAN SWITCH TO WIFI, GPS, SILENT MODE, AUTO ROTATION. ALSO BLUETOOTH WHICH SHOULD BE MADE VISIBLE ONLY THEN FILES CAN TRANSFERRED.
      
      6. INBUILT MEMORY IS QUITE LARGE I.E. 1.97 GB APPROX. THAT IS GOOD NEWS. INTERNAL STORAGE IS 16GB WHERE 11.31GB IS ONLY USUABLE BY BUYER. WE CAN ALSO INSERT MEMORY CARD UPTO 32 GB.
      
      7. HEATING IS A NOT A MATTER WHILE CHARGING. ONLY WHEN HEAVY APPS ARE USED WHILE HEATS THE MOBILE TO 40 DEGREES. IF NOT NO PROBLEM REGARDING HEATING.
      
      8. OS IS 2.3.6 (GINGERBREAD), NOT ICS NOR JELLY BEAN WHICH IS DISAPPOINTING TO ME.
      
      9. COMING TO BATTERY, ITS 1500 MAH SAMSUNG BATTERY, WHICH STANDS FOR 8 HOURS WHEN USING PACKET DATA 3G NETWORK CONTINUOUSLY.
      
      OVERALL ITS GOOD MOBILE TO BUY WITHIN 20000. BUT WHEN I BOUGHT IT WAS 23K."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I HAD RECEIVED MOBILE IN 3 DAYS ,ALSO THERE IS LOT OF PRICE DIFF B/N FLIPKART AND MOBILE STORE
      
      
      DONT THINK JUST BUY IT
      
      
      MOBILE ALSO HAD GOOD FEATURES WITH GREAT DUAL CORE PROCE,
      
      GREAT PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE 14500
      
      GREATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM ONE MONTH. THE PHONE IS REALLY VERY NICE SPECIALLY IN SCREEN PART. THE 16M SUPER AMOLED SCREEN IS THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THEN 20K PRICED GRAND, GALAXY S DUOS AND GALAXY GRAND QUATTRO. JUST PUT ALL THESE PHONE IN NEAR AND U CAN EASILY FEEL THE CLARITY. THE GPU IS VERY GOOD. I M PLAYING FRONTLINE COMMANDO IN THIS PHONE WITHOUT ANY DISTURBANCE. THERE IS NO DROP OF FA SINGLE FRAME. JUST 1 WEEK BEFORE I UPDATE ITS SOFTWARE TO JELLY BEAN. I M NOT SATISFIED FROM JB IN TERMS OF BATTERY LIFE. MY PHONE'S BATTERY LIFE IS JUST DECREASED 25-30% NOW. I DONT KNOW WHY. I HAVE RESET FACTORY SETTINGS SEVERAL TIMES. BT THE PROBLEM REMAINS SAME. PLEASE SAMSUNG FIX THIS ISSUE. MY PHONE IS NOT GIVING BATTERY BACKUP OF 1 DAY IN NORMAL USE."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I HAVE NOTICED , SOME REVIEWS BELOW.......I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FK 3 DAYS AGO IMMEDIATELY I HAVE UPDATED IT TO JELLY BEAN VIA KIES. THIS PHONE IMPROVES ITS PERFORMANCE WITH JB UPDATE , AFTER UPDATING MAKE SURE TO SET IT TO FACTORY DEFAULT TO AVOID LAGGING.
      
      AFTER UPDATING IT PERFORMS LIKE A HIGHER END SMART PHONE."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I HAVE PURCHASED THE PHONE BUT IT HASNOT REACHED UPTO ME AS YETPROBABLYIN A DAY OR TWO..I WILL GET IT .THIS WOULD BE MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE.SINCE THE JB UPDATE IS AVAILABLE ,,THIS IS  FIRST THING I WOULD LIKE TO DO I.E UPDATE TO JB..CAN ANY ONE HELP ME BY TELLING ME HOW TO UPDATE THE JB? ..WAT ALL IS REQUIRED ???????IN DETAILS PLEASE.. WILL WRITE THE REVIEW SHORTLY"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I PLACED ORDER ON 4/8/13 AND GOT IT ON 7/8/13. THANK YOU FLIPKART AND THE SELLER FOR THE FAST DELIVERY.
      
      THIS IS THE BEST BRAND PHONE BELOW 15K AND S ADVANCE IS AN S2 MINI.
      
      IT HAS A 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY.
      
      THERE ARE SOME 4 OR 5 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN S2 AND S ADVANCE BUT S2 COSTS DOUBLE THAT OF S ADVANCE. I AM SURE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY PHONE WHICH GIVE THIS GREAT SCREEN FOR THIS AMOUNT.
      
      I USED IT FOR A SINGLE DAY TILL NOW SO WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER FEW DAYS
      
      
      PROS:
      
      EVERYTHING IS A PRO FOR THIS PRICE RANGE
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. THE PHYSICAL BUTTON AT THE CENTER FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE, A CAPACITY TOUCH WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT. I THINK ITS SAME FOR ALL SAMSUNG PHONES
      
      2. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF THE DESIGN IS EXACTLY LIKE S2. THE SMALL CURVE ON THE SCREEN FEELS WEIRD(BUT NO ISSUES, ACTUALLY NOT A CON)
      
      3.THE CHARGER CABLE IS NON DETACHABLE FROM ADAPTOR UNLIKE MODERN CHARGERS, AS ITS AN ISSUE FOR ME AS I HAVE TO USE THE 2ND CABLE TO CHARGE FROM PC. (NOT A SERIOUS ISSUE)
      
      UPDATE 1:
      
      IT REQUIRES SOME 3.5 HOURS TO CHARGE 0 TO 100 PERCENT. I HAVE TO KEEP IT CHARGED AT NIGHT TO GET IT FULLY CHARGED."

Galaxy S Advance,4,"I PURCHASED THIS MOBILE FOR MY SISTER, EARLIER I HAD PURCHASED LG OPTIMUS 2X FOR MYSELF AT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE. A CONFIG BETWEEN LOW END AND HIGH END PHONE, OPTIMAL FOR A BASIC USER FOR GAMING AND BROWSING. NO ISSUES WITH THE PHONE AS OF NOW, SIS QUIET HAPPY WITH IT. RATING OF 4 FOR THE ONE AND ONLY REASON BECAUSE I WAS EXPECTING A FACTORY UPGRADE TO ICS ATLEAST."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. AS USUAL, FLIPKART DIDN'T DISAPPOINT.
      
      
      THE PHONE LOOKS AND FEELS GOOD. THE SCREEN SIZE IS IDEAL. SMS AND APPS KEYPAD APPEAR LARGE ENOUGH TO TYPE EASILY. THE SOUND QUALITY IS DEFINITELY GOOD IF NOT TOP-NOTCH.
      
      
      THE SUPER AMOLED SCREEN IS DEFINITELY ROBUST .I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT SINCE I DROPPED THE PHONE ONCE  &AMP; NOT EVEN A SCRATCH ON THE SCREEN :)
      
      
      IT'S REALLY VALUE FOR MONEY. I RECOMMEND IT."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I RECEIVED THIS PHONE ABOUT 10 DAYS BACK. FLIPKART TOOK 8 DAYS TO DELIVER THIS PRODUCT. I WAS SWITCHING OVER TO ANDROID FROM WINDOWS MOBILE 6.5 AND HENCE USING ANDROID SYSTEM IS A GREAT JOY FOR ME. 2 DAYS BACK RECEIVED JEYY BEAN UPDATE AND SINCE THEN THE PERFORMANCE IMPROVED DRMATICALLY. AS PER ME FOLLOWING ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PHONE
      
      
      PROS
      
      1) RESPONSIVE SCREEN
      
      2) GOOD DISPLAY AND MOVIE QUALITY
      
      3) GOOD BATTERY LIFE (NOW RUNNING FOR MORE THAN 2 DAYS AFTER JELLY BEAN UPDATE)
      
      4) EARPHONE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT WITH N7 MUSIC PLAYER
      
      5) TRIED MAJOR GAMES AND THEY RUN WITHOUT ANY LAG (LOOKS LIKE 768 MB RAM HELPS)
      
      
      CONS
      
      1) AVERAGE CAMERA (JEYY BEAN UPDATE NOW HAS PROVIDED ZOOM FUNCTIONALITY)
      
      2) SPEAKER IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH. I USED MP3GAIN TO INCREASE SOUND VOLUME AND AFTER THAT IT IS OK.
      
      3) 3.5 MM JACK SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT TOP"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I WANT TO KNOW THAT IT'S RAM MEMORY IS 768 MB, IS IT ENOUGH TO SMOOTHLY RUNNING APPS ON THIS MOBILE, OR ANY HANGING PROBLEM OCCURS OR NOT. AND AFTER UPDATING OS 2.3 TO 4.0 IS HTERE ANY PROBLEM WITH ANY FUNCTION OR LOW MEMORY."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I WANTED TO BUY A PHONE FOR MY MOTHER AND DECIDED ON THIS AS THIS IS THE RIGHT SIZE (4"") FOR HER.
      
      SO FAR SHE IS VERY HAPPY WITH THE PHONE AND IS ALSO VERY COMFORTABLE CONSIDERING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SHE IS USING A SMARTPHONE (EARLIER ONE WAS SAMSUNG KEYPAD PHONE)
      
      AS USUAL EXCELLENT DELIVERY BY FLIPKART, RECEIVED THE PHONE WITHIN 24 HOURS FROM PLACING THE ORDER."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"I WAS VERY CONFUSED BETWEEN THIS PHONE AND MICROMAX A116 HD. 15K BUDGET. MICROMAX A116 HD HAS A BETTER PROCESSOR AND CAMERA. SAMSUNG HAS A BETTER BUILD, AFTER SALES SERVICE, LONGER BATTERY LIFE, SUPER AMOLED SCREEN (MAJOR PLUS POINT FOR ME - I USE GPS A LOT AND IT CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO READ MAPS IN BROAD SUNLIGHT WITH TFT SCREEN) AND LARGER INTERNAL MEMORY (I DID NOT WANT TO SPEND EXTRA ON A MEMORY CARD CONSIDERING 15K WAS THE UPPER LIMIT OF MY BUDGET AND I NEED A MIN OF 4 GB STORAGE) BUT YOU DON'T GET ZOOM - ONE MAJOR FLAW. SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME. CAMERA IS DECENT - IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO USES THEIR PHONE TO CLICK QUALITY PICTURES, THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR YOU. I HAVE DOWNLOADED ABOUT 10 APPS ON MY PHONE BY FAR AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO LAGS.
      
      
      SONY XPERIA U WOULD BE A GOOD CHOICE IN THE PRICE RANGE OF 10-15K AS WELL.
      
      
      FLIPKART DIDN'T DELIVER BY THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE. IT TOOK 6 DAYS TO DELIVER THE PRODUCT AND I AM LOCATED IN MUMBAI. QUITE DISAPPOINTING AS MY OLD ORDERS REACHED ME IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS AND THE ONLY REASON I USED FLIPKART TO ORDER THIS PHONE (INSPITE OF THE HIGHER PRICE!) WAS (PROMISE OF) QUICK DELIVERY ."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"ITS A GREAT PHONE BUT I'VE HEARD AND SEEN FIRST HAND TAT THIS MOBILE HAS SOME MAJOR NETWORK CONNECTIVITY ISSUES ESP. AT PLACES WHERE SIGNAL STRENGTH IS LOW-MEDIUM........ ANYBODY ELSE HAS THAT PROBLEM....???? OTHERWISE EVERYTHING IS AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE PRICE. JELLYBEAN UPDATE MAY COME, I HOPE.....  BATTERY POWER IS AVERAGE IF U USE NORMALLY FOR 8 HRS..... GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN,ETC RUNS..... BUT NOT AT ITS BEST...."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"ITS A GREAT PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE. IT EVEN BEATS SONY XPERIA P. IT HAS ALMOST SAME CONF AS OF SONY XPERIA P OTHER THAN CAMERA. BUT A 5 MP CAMERA OF SAMSUNG WOULD BE SAME AS OF 8 MP OF OTHER BRANDS. I AM USING IT FOR AROUND TWO WEEKS.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1) 4 INCH SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY. GOOD RESOLUTION.
      
      2) VERY ELEGANT STYLE.
      
      3) 1 GHZ DUAL CORE WITH 768 MB RAM GIVES SMOOTH PROCESSING.
      
      4) 5 MP &AMP; 1.3MP CAMERA WITH GOOD QUALITY PICS.
      
      5) 1500 MAH BATTERY. VERY GOOD BATTERY LIFE.
      
      6) TOUCH FRIENDLY. NO LAG. PRETTY RESPONSIVE.
      
      7) ONLINE MOVIES CAN BE WATCHED NON STOP.
      
      8) SPEAKER SOUND IS GOOD.
      
      9) 11 GB INTERNAL STORAGE WITH EXTENDABLE OPTION.
      
      10) OS DOES NOT HANG. PLAYED FEW GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN.
      
      
      ALL THIS IN 19 K.
      
      
      YES, IT HAS FEW CONS.
      
      CONS:
      
      1) NO ANDROID 4
      
      2) NO CAMERA ZOOM FUNCTION. TOUGH I FOUND AN APP TO ZOOM BUT HAVE TO WORK ON IT.
      
      
      NOTE: THERE IS A FEATURE AND NOT A COMPLAIN OVER ANDROID PHONE WHICH MANY PPL FACED. IF YOU SEE THAT AFTER A CALL, YOUR NETWORK IS DROPPING AND AFTER SOME TIME IT IS COMING BACK, THEN DO THE FOLLOWING AND THAT ISSUE WILL GET SOLVE.
      
      SETTINGS--&GT;WIRELESS &AMP; NETWORK--&GT; MOBILE NETWORK--&GT; NETWORK MODE--&GT; GSM ONLY*"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"ITS OFFICIAL NOW, AFTER JB UPDATE AND FACTORY RESET THE PHONE HAS BECOME BEST IN ITS RANGE. THE ONLY CONS IS THAT RAM IS 768 MB. OTHERWISE EVERYTHING ELSE IS ROCKING , YOU JUST CAN'T FIND ANY PONE WITH SUCH FEATURES IN THIS PRICE.
      
      
      I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST 1.5 MONTHS AND I DID NOT FIND ANY PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE. NO N/W ISSUES.
      
      
      FEW THINGS OBSERVED AFTER JB UPDATE:
      
      
      1. BATTERY LIFE HAS INCREASED.
      
      2. CAMERA HAS THE ZOOM FACILITY NOW WHICH WASN'T THE CASE BEFORE JB UPDATE. YOU HAVE TO PRESS VOLUME +/- KEY ON THE SIDE EDGE OF THE PHONE FOR ZOOM WHILE USING CAMERA.
      
      3. BIT INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE AS WELL.
      
      
      IF YOU GUYS HAVEN'T UPDATED THIS PHONE TO JB, DO IT NOW ITSELF USING KIES AIR SOFTWARE FROM SAMSUNG OFFICIAL WEBSITE. IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"LACK OF RAM, OTHERS ASPECTS ARE SUPERB,GOOD CAMERA, SUPERB SCREEN
      
      BATTERY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, BUT EASILY LASTS ONE DAY, SO NO GRIPES HERE
      
      INTERNAL STORAGE LIMITED TO AROUND 2GB FOR APPS, WILL HAVE TO ROOT THE PHONE TO INCREASE THE PARTITION SIZE
      
      VOLUME LEVELS ARE NOT VERY HIGH, BOTH IN SPEAKER AND EARPHONE....... MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTY IN RUNNING SENNHEISER EAR CUPS.
      
      
      LAUNCH THIS CELL WITH 2GB RAM AND MORE STORAGE FOR APPS WITH 2000 MAH BATTERY, WITH OTHER ASPECTS BEING THE SAME....... PRICE IT AROUND 14K IT WILL DEFINATELY SELL LIKE HOT CAKES."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"LET ME TELL ALL YOU GUYS WHO HATE IT .
      
      SIMPLE SPEAKING YOU CANNOT GET A SMARTPHONE LIKE THIS AT SUCH A LOW PRICE ...
      
      DAMN GOOD SPECS YOU CAN COMPARE WITH THE 24K GALAXY S2 NEARLY SAME ONLY CAMERA AND RAM  DIFFERENCE . (0.3 INCH BIGGER SCREEN DOSENT MATTER)
      
      
      THE FACT IS THE PHONE RUNS BUTTER SMOOTH ON GINGER BREAD I HAVE HAVE USED IT NO LAGS ON CERTAIN HIGH GRAPHIC GAMES (TEMPLE RUN 2 , ASPHALT 6, DEAD TRIGGER, SHADOW GUN) ALL PLAY LIKE FLUID.. IF YOUR RAM IS MORE THAN 200 MB USABLE THEN IT WILL FLAWLESSLY WORK ..
      
      
      ONLY CON IS JELLY BEAN UPDATE WELL I WENT TO THE SAMSUNG SHOWROOM AND ASKED THEM ABOUT THE DEVICE .
      
      THEY SAID TO ME THAT THE DEVICE IS STILL AVAILABLE BUT THEY DONT HAVE STOCK AND TO THE UPDATE THE DEVICE WILL BE UPGRADED (PROMISED OFFICIAL JB UPDATE IN INDIA) SOON .
      
      
      BEFORE THE HIKE IN PRICE IN APRIL. GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS AS THIS AMOUNT OF SPECS NO MOBILE OFFER ..
      
      IF JELLY BEAN AND ZOOM IN CAMERA DOUBT YOU THEN WAIT FOR SOME TIME JUST BE PATIENT.
      
      
      THERE IS NO GOOD ABOUT JB IT IS JUST NEW APPEARENCE AND USER FRIENDLY AND I DONT THINK THAT YOU HAVE TESTED ALL APPS OF GB . AND THOSE WHO THINK THE BATTERY BACKUP INCREASES KNEW NOTHING AFTER JB BACKUP ONLY INCREASES TO 30-40 MINUTES MORE .
      
      I HAVE TESTED WITH THIS AND AFTER PLAYING 40-45 MIN GAMING , 30-40 MINS OF TALKING , SURFING
      
      WQATCHING VIDEOS FOR 2-2.5 HR MY BATTERY EASILY LAST FOR 12 HOURS AS I AM A GAMING FREAK AND I USUALLY OPEN YOUTUBE TO WATCH VIDEOS.. TO ME THE BACKUP WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR A SMARTPHONE WITH ANDROID TO HANDLE IT.
      
      
      YOU WONT KNOW WHEN FLIPKART AND ANY OTHR ONLINE SITE INCREASE THE PRICES AS TODAY I READ THE MORNING PAPER AND THE PRICES OF NOTE 2 , S3 INCREASED BY 2000. AS ON FLIPKART TOO NOTE COSTS MORE THAN 37K
      
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY A MIDRANGE DEVICE LYK THIS AND DONT GO FOR SUCH BULKY MONSTERS OUT THERE NOTE 2 , S3 THEY ARE GOOD FOR APPEARENCE AND WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WITH QQUAD CORE WITH 2 GB RAM ITS NOT A LAPTOP WITH NVIDIA PROCESSOR THAT 2 GB RAM NEEDED FOR MOBILE WITH MORE THAN 5 INCH DISPLAY RATHER BUY TAB 2 FOR 15K .
      
      SAVE MONEY GUYS AT SUCH A LOW COST WITH DUAL CORE (MULTITASKING WITH EASE ) U WILL NOT GET A PHONE..
      
      
      FOR THOSE WHO THINK GOING FOR S3,NOTE2 I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY A LAPTOP WITHE CORE I3 2 GB RAM MINIMUM .. AND THESE JELLY BEAN TOYS WILL SHIT IN FRONT OF IT.."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"MODELLED AFTER THE S2, THE S ADVANCE IS A REALLY GOOD PHONE. THE ONLY OTHER DUEL CORE PHONE AT THIS PRICE RANGE IS THE LUMIA 620. HOWEVER WITH A HIGHER RAM AND A BIGGER SCREEN, THIS PHONE EASILY OUT STRIPS THE 620. IT HAS ALSO GOT A GREAT AMOLED SCREEN WITH HIGH PIXEL DENSITY, THAT IS APPROPRIATELY SENSATIVE AND PROVIDES VERY VIVID OUTPUT.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A SUB 20K PHONE."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"NICE EXPERIENCE WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE..  I AM FULLY SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF PERFORMANCE, MODEL, CAMERA AND ALL. ALSO GOOD HANDLING BY COURIER PEOPLES.
      
      
      VERY FAST SHIPMENT FROM FLIPKART.
      
      
      THANKS TEAM..."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"NICE PHONE, I BOUGHT THE MOBILE 4 MONTHS BACK. SO FAR I DON?T FACE ANY ISSUES.
      
      
      +
      
      NICE DESIGN, DISPLAY, SPEED.
      
      
      -
      
      GINGERBREAD(GIVING OLD LOOK), IF WE UPGRADE TO HIGHER VERSION(THIS WILL PERFORM DEAD SLOW).LEAVE IT WITH GINGERBREAD AS IS."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"PHONE IS GOOD..SAMSUNG HAS DONE A GREAT JOB! FIRSTLY KUDOS TO FLIPKART, GOT IT IN 3 DAYS... AMOLED SCREE...WOW!!GRAPHICS ARE JUST TOO GOOD FOR GAMING...5MP CAMERA IS GREAT FOR GOOD PICSS..DUAL CORE PROCESSOR IS VERY FAST..BUILD QUALITY - NOT PRETTY IMPRESSIVE WITH PLASTICS. TIME FOR SAMSUNG TO BE BETTER AND INNOVATIVE WITH THE DESIGN. ..ON THE WHOLE DECENT MID-RANGE PHONE..GO FOR IT"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY WIFE. BEST PHONE IN 18999/- FROM FLIPKART, IT GOT DELIVERED IN LESS THAN 36HRS...GR8 GOING FLIPKART.
      
      
      EXCEPT SOUND QUALITY EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS AMAZING, BEEN UPGRADED TO 4.1, AND MADE IT MORE AWESOME. 16GB INTERNAL MEMORY IS A ++. USABLE IS 11GB STILL GOOD ENOUGH."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"SUPER AMOLED, 3/4TH GB RAM IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MANY IF YOU DON'T USE VERY LARGE APPLICATIONS OR GAMES. GOOD BATTERY BACK UP. GOOD SOUND QUALITY.
      
      
      DON'T UPGRADE TO JELLY BEAN JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE OPTION AND ITS FREE; IT WILL MAKE YOUR MOBILE SO SLOGGY THAT YOU NEVER EXPECTED!
      
      
      JUST BUY WITHOUT ANY CONFUSION."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"THE PHONE IS A DELIGHT WITH SOME MINOR BUGS...
      
      1ST BUG.. I EXPERIENCED A BATTERY PROBLEM WHICH WAS NOT A BIG ISSUE AS COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES IN THIS CATEGORY.. BUT YEAH IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER..
      
      2ND BUG.. WHAT THE HELL IS MTP INITIALIZATION???? I HAVE PUNTO AND ITS GOT A USB PORT TO PLAY MUSIC .. I DONT KNOW WHY IT DOESNT PLAY MY SONGS... PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP ME IN THIS...
      
      
      REST EVERYTHING IS SUPER DUPER AWESOME.. LOVE THE AMOLED SCREEN...
      
      DUAL CORE IS SATISFYING MY DESIRE OF MULTITASKING...
      
      LOOKS ARE DASHING TOO.. GUYS GO FOR THIS.. 19K IS THE BEST BUY ..."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"THE SCREEN IS HIGHLY RESPONSIVE AS LIKE ANY FLAGSHIP PHONE.
      
      THE PHONE LOOKS PREMIUM IN HAND BUT IF YOU REMOVE THE BACK COVER, YOU'LL FIND IT VERY CHEAP.
      
      THE SPEAKER OF PHONE IS LOUD ENOUGH TO HEAR BUT VIBRATOR MOTOR ISN'T MUCH STRONG.
      
      THE STOCK VIDEO PLAYER IS SIMPLE BUT IT SUPPORTS ALL FREE FORMATS INCLUDING THE MATROSKA I.E. .MKV FORMAT WHICH IS THE LATEST AMONG ALL OPEN STANDARD FREE FORMATS.
      
      THE BIGGEST PLUS POINT OF PHONE IS ITS DISPLAY. I HAD COMPARED IT WITH MICROMAX CANVAS HD(720P HD RESOLUTION), THE S ADVANCE'S COLORS ARE CRISP AND CLEAR UNLIKE CANVAS HD'S WHITISH SCREEN.
      
      THE BATTERY BACKUP OF PHONE IS GOOD. USING THE PHONE MODERATELY (ABOUT 32MIN OF CALLS, 2HRS. OF MUSIC, 30MIN OF 2G INTERNET, 10MIN OF GAME) THE BATTERY LASTED FOR AN ABOUT 28-30HRS. BUT ON THE CONTRARY SIDE THE PHONE TAKES ABOUT 2-2.5 HRS. TO FULL CHARGE.
      
      DESPITE 1GHZ DUAL-CORE PROCESSOR AND 768MB OF RAM, THE PHONE IS SLUGGISH TO EXIT APPLICATIONS AND RETURN TO THE HOME SCREEN WHEN COMMANDED.
      
      THE SPECS CLAIM THAT THE PHONE HAS 768 MB OF RAM BUT I HAVE FOUND IT ONLY 555 MB.
      
      OTHER NOTABLE FEATURES/APPS INCLUDE CALCULATOR, ALARM, GOOGLE MAPS. ALL ARE INTEGRATED NICELY ON THE DEVICE.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE CAMERA FANATIC THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PHONE BECAUSE
      
      1. THE PHONE DOESN'T HAVE ZOOM MODE.
      
      2. THERE?S NO SETTING TO CHANGE DEFAULT NAME OF THE IMAGES TAKEN BY CAMERA.
      
      3. AFTER CLICKING SNAPS YOU?LL NOTICE THAT THE IMAGES ARE QUITE CLEAR, BUT BELIEVE ME IMAGES LOOK CLEAR BECAUSE OF SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY NOT BECAUSE OF CAMERA. HENCE IF YOU WANT TO CHECK ITS IMAGE QUALITY THEN COPY YOUR PHOTOS TO YOUR PC YOU WILL GET TO KNOW THE COLORS AREN?T RICH AND DEEP. ALSO THE PHOTOS LOOK GRAINY. BUT ONE THING WHICH GOES IN FAVOR OF CAMERA IS ITS LED FLASH; YES IT?S POWERFUL AND VERY BRIGHT.
      
      
      ADDITIONAL INFORMATION &AMP; SPECIAL FEATURES:
      
      THE PHONE HAS 10 POINT MULTI TOUCH DISPLAY.
      
      SOC: NOVATHOR U8500 (SAME FOR GALAXY ACE 2, S3 MINI, XPERIA GO, SOLA, P, U)
      
      CPU: ARM CORTEX A9 DUAL CORE (SAME FOR GALAXY ACE 2, S3 MINI, XPERIA GO, SOLA, P, U)
      
      GPU: ARM MALI 400 MP SINGLE CORE (SAME FOR GALAXY S2, XPERIA U)
      
      SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY: 45NM
      
      SAR VALUE (SPECIFIC ABSORPTION RATE MAX SHOULD BE 1.6W/KG. BY FCC): 0.543 W/KG.
      
      (BETTER THAN ALL OTHER NON-SAMSUNG PHONES)
      
      SYSTEM STORAGE MEMORY (FOR INSTALLING APPS): 1.97 GB
      
      USB STORAGE MEMORY (FOR STORING DATA): 11.31 GB
      
      EVERYONE WANTS HD RECORDING &AMP; SO DOES THE CAMERA CAPTURE VIDEO VERY WELL BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT. FOR 10 SEC. VIDEO (.MP4, 720P HD) IT CONSUMED 14.5 MB OF MEMORY.
      
      
      BENCHMARK SCORES:
      
      IN BROWSER MARK &AMP; SUN SPIDER IT MANAGES TO BEAT GALAXY S2 BUT IN OTHER BENCH MARKS ALSO IT PERFORMS ABOVE THE AVERAGE THAN ITS COMPETITORS SUCH AS XPERIA P AND DESIRE X.
      
      
      TURN OVER TO MUTE:
      
      IF SOMEONE IS CALLING YOU AND YOU DON?T WISH THAT THE PHONE SHOULD RING THEN JUST TURN OVER YOUR DEVICE, RINGER BELL OF YOUR PHONE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MUTED.
      
      
      TILT TO ENLARGE PICTURE:
      
      WHILE BROWSING IMAGES. IF YOU WANT TO ZOOM IN WITHOUT USING DOUBLE TAP &AMP; PINCH TO ZOOM ACTION THEN JUST TOUCH TAP &AMP; HOLD AT ANY TWO POINTS OF IMAGE AND THEN TILT THE DEVICE BACK AND FORTH TO ENLARGE OR REDUCE IMAGE SIZE.
      
      
      SCREENSHOT CAPTURE (ONE OF THE FEATURE OF ICS):
      
      PRESS AND HOLD THE HOME BUTTON AND PRESS THE POWER BUTTON. DO NOT PRESS AND HOLD HOME BUTTON FOR LONG TIME OR ELSE YOU WILL GET TASK MANAGER OPTION.
      
      
      POP-UP PLAY (ONE OF FEATURE OF GALAXY S3/S4):
      
      USE MOBO-PLAYER TO PLAY VIDEO AND PRESS HOME BUTTON AND THERE YOU GO FOR POP-UP PLAY.
      
      
      SCROLL ALL HOME SCREENS IN ONE SWIPE:
      
      THE NUMBERED DOTS (EACH BELONGING TO 7 HOME SCREENS) SERVE AS A SCROLL BAR TOO. PRESS AND HOLD ON THE DOTS LETS YOU SCROLL SIDEWAYS IN ONE GO RATHER THAN SWIPING MULTIPLE TIMES TO GO TO THE REQUIRED HOME SCREEN.
      
      
      FOLDER ON HOME SCREEN (ONE OF THE FEATURE OF ICS):
      
      YOU CAN CREATE FOLDERS ON HOME SCREEN AND ADD SHORTCUT TO APPS IN AN ORGANIZED MANNER.
      
      
      FINALLY IF YOU'RE WILLING TO BUY THIS PHONE:
      
      MAKE IT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE SINCE THE DEVICE IS DISCONTINUED FROM SAMSUNG INDIA, HENCE THE PHONE IS AVAILABLE TILL THE STOCK ENDS AND THEREFORE I THINK THE PRICE HAS BEEN SLASHED TO FINISH THE STOCK.
      
      UNIQUENESS OF THE PHONE IS ITS DISPLAY. IT?S CURVED AND MADE OF CORNING?S REINFORCED GORILLA GLASS EXCEPT ONLY GALAXY NEXUS, S ADVANCE HAS CURVED DISPLAY. EVEN THE GALAXY NEXUS? IS NOT GORILLA GLASS.
      
      DO NOT USE FLIP COVER FOR YOUR PHONE SINCE THE DISPLAY IS CURVED, DUE TO WHICH THE COVER WILL START BENDING DAY BY DAY. INSTEAD USE SILICON COVER.
      
      SCREEN GUARD: USE ROUGH SCREEN GUARD INSTEAD OF SMOOTH ONE. SMOOTH WILL FEEL LITTLE STICKY TO FINGERS &AMP; ITS FINGER PRINT FRIENDLY.
      
      
      SUGGESTION:
      
      PLEASE DO NOT UPGRADE TO JELLYBEAN OS, SINCE IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED FOR INDIA YET. EVEN IF YOU'RE GOING TO UPGRADE IT'LL VOID YOUR WARRANTY.
      
      
      EXCEPT CAMERA &AMP; GINGERBREAD OS, I LIKED MY PHONE IN EVERY WAY.
      
      BUY YOUR PHONE CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT'S A DEVICE WHICH YOU'LL KEEP 24X7 WITH YOU."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"THIS IS TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED PHONE AT AFFORDABLE PRICE. IT PROVIDES AWESOME GAMING EXPERIENCE. ALL THE PROBLEMS MENTIONED IN REVIEWS, LIKE BATTERY DRAIN, HEATING ETC WILL GET SORTED AFTER RUNNING SOFTWARE/FIRMWARE UPDATE USING KIES APPLICATION. THIS UPDATE WILL REMOVE SOME STOCK WALLPAPERS AND APPS LIKE TASK MANAGER IT IS WISER TO WAIT A WHILE FOR JELLY BEAN UPDATE SINCE THERE ARE REPORTS THAT STILL IT HAS NOT PROVED STABLE."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"THIS PHONE HAS SOME PROBLEMS LIKE NETWORK ISSUES, NO OPTION FOR CAMERA ZOOM AND ALSO PHOTO CAPTURE TIME IS VERY LONG, I.E SHUTTER LAG IS MORE....BUT AT 15500/- ONLY THIS PHONE IS GREAT...OR YOU CAN THINK OF SONY XPERIA J...BOTH ARE GOOD...."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"THIS PHONE IS NOW OFFICIALLY UP-GRADABLE TO JELLY BEAN 4.1. SAMSUNG PROMISED TO UPDATE IT 4.2 JB
      
      FOR GAMERS ITS A DELIGHT BECAUSE OF ITS GPU = MALI400M
      
      SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY WHICH CONSUMES LESS BATTERY AND PRODUCE SHARP IMAGES
      
      BETTER THEN HTC DESIRE X IN HARDWARE SPECS"
Galaxy S Advance,4,"THIS WAS MY 2ND ORDER WITH FLIPKART AND AS USUAL QUALITY PRODUCT FROM SAMSUNG AND BEST IN CLASS SERVICE FROM FLIPKART.

      CONCLUSION: MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST HANDSET BUT BEST AMOUNG VERY FEW AVAILABLE WITH DUAL CORE PROCESSOR WITHIN SUCH RANGE. HENCE, RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WITH BUDGET CONSTRAINT."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"TOO GUD PHONE WITH SUCH FEATURES AND WITH BRAND NAME AS SAMSUNG. BEING MY FIRST ANDROID - SAMSUNG I AM QUITE HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE .. IT HAS NEARLY ALL THE FEATURES AVAILABLE IN TODAY'S OTHER HIGH END PHONE.. YES IF YOU ARE GONA ASK FOR MULTIPLE WINDOW, OR 100 OTHER CAMERA FEATURES, OR HD GAMES... ITS NOT BUT IF YOU ARE A NORMAL PHONE USER WHO HAS TO TAKE 20 - 30 CALLS A DAY, LISTENING 5- 10 SONGS CLICKING 4-5 PICS OF YOUR LOVED ONES &AMP; PLAYING GAMES   FOR 40 - 60 MINS FOR PEACE OF MIND .... GO FOR IT..."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"UPDATED IT TO JELLY BEAN AND LOVE THE POWER SAVING OPTIONS OF IT. IT WORKS GREAT AND ADD IT WITH AN APP AND IT WILL DO A BETTER JOB. HOWEVER, THE BATTERY OF 1500MAH IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS PHONE. SAMSUNG SHOULD HAVE PUT IN A BIT MORE JUICE IN THIS AREA.
      
      
      THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS OF 16GB HOWEVER 11.5GB CAN BE USED. I THINK FOR APPLICATIONS THE LIMIT IS AROUND 1.8GB. THE STORAGE OPTIONS ARE A BIT CONFUSING BUT IT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR MY USE. THE MUSIC PLAYS GOOD, THE CAMERA IS GOOD.
      
      
      THE BUILD SCARES ME A BIT AND THE BACK OF THE PHONE HAS THE PLASTICKY FEEL. I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THE HEADPHONE PORT AND THE MINI USB PORT IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PHONE.
      
      
      HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS CAME FOR 14,000 AND AT THIS PRICE THERE IS NO OTHER PHONE (SAMSUNG, HTC, NOKIA, MOTOROLA) WHICH CAN MATCH THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THIS PHONE, I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"V.GOOD PHONE IN THIS RANGE...INTERNAL MEMORY 16GB V.NICE :) :)
      
      
      ONLY 1 DRAWBACK...NO CAMERA ZOOM...
      
      AND
      
      NEED ANROID UPDATE FOR THE PHONE..ITS 2.3..NEED 4.1 :(
      
      EXCEPT THIS ALL IS PERFECT...
      
      
      OR WAIT FOR NOKIA LUMIA 620,520.............."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"VERY GOOD SMART PHONE AT THIS PRICE RANGE.. PERFORMANCE IS VERY GOOD.. BATTERY BACKUP LOOKS NOT BAD AT ALL.. IT WOULD BE GUD IF SAMSUNG WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANY OTHER DIFFERENT MODEL LIKE SAMSUNG DOUS.
      
      
      WHEN U COMPARE WITH NOKIA LUMIA - THIS IS TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED FEATURE AND PERFORMANCE."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"WHAT ABOUT THE NETWORK PROBLEM IN THIS PHONE GUYS??? NETWORK PROBLEM SOLVED AFTER UPDATE OR WHAT???
      
      WHAT ABOUT THE NETWORK PROBLEM IN THIS PHONE GUYS??? NETWORK PROBLEM SOLVED AFTER UPDATE OR WHAT???
      
      WHAT ABOUT THE NETWORK PROBLEM IN THIS PHONE GUYS??? NETWORK PROBLEM SOLVED AFTER UPDATE OR WHAT???"
Galaxy S Advance,4,WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM SIMILAR FOLKS IS ITS STELLER SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY.PROCESSOR IS REALLY SNAPPY.GAMES RUN WITHOUT ANY ISSUES.I WAS ON THE WAY TO BUY HTC ONE V BUT AT FINAL MOMENT I CHANGED MY PLANNNN!!!..AND BOUGT DIS BEAST.ND BOY!!..AM NOT WRONG
Galaxy S Advance,4,"WITH IN ONE AND HALF DAY I GOT THE PHONE...I AM JUST LOVING IT WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY FLIPKART MUST SAY GREAT WORK DONE..
      
      COMING TO THE PHONE...BUILD OF THE AWESOME GOOD SPECS.. ITS A MUST BUY PHONE WITH IN 15K... DISPLAY IS GOOD ..ONLY CON IT COMES WITH GINGERBREAD...IF ANYONE LOOKING FOR A PHONE IN 15K RANGE THEN GO FOR IT..."
Galaxy S Advance,4,"YEAH NW DATS SOMETHING WE ALL WANT , ANDROID OS IN A POWERFUL YET AFFORDABLE MACHINE LIKE DIS 1. FOR DOSE WHO CANT AFFORD S2, ITS A PERFECT REPLACEMENT.

VIDEOS ND MUSIC RUN FABULOUS. DONT THINK MUCH JUZZ GRAB DIS PUNKASS.."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"31/5/13 - THIS IS GONNA BE MY FIRST SMARTPHONE AND AFTER SERIOUS THOUGHT, I ZEROED IN FOR THIS MODEL. I ORDERED THIS PHONE TODAY WITH COD OPTION. THE POINTS WHICH MADE ME GO FOR THIS MODEL ARE
      
      1. MY NEED IS A SMARTPHONE NOT MORE THAN 4.3 INCHES, NOT HEAVY, WITH MOST OF THE OPTIONS YOU GET IN A SMARTPHONE.
      
      2. MY BUDGET WAS AROUND 15K BUT WAS WILLING TO EXTEND UPTO 18K IF REQUIRED.
      
      3. INITIALLY I WAS ATTRACTED TOWARDS LUMIA 620/720 BUT THEN DID SOME ANALYSIS AND SOME HANDLING IN A NEARBY STORE AND FELT ANDROID GIVES MORE OPTIONS AND ITS VERY CUSTOMISABLE. HENCE DECIDED AGAINST WP8.
      
      4. WITH SAMSUNG, THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS ARE S ADVANCE, GRAND QUATTRO AND GRAND. THE LATTER IS A STRICT NO SINCE ITS HUGE (FOR MY TASTE) AND QUATTRO DOESNT HAVE GOOD REVIEWS AND BIG. BUT I FELT THE SCREEN WAS GREAT, NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABT IT.
      
      5. S ADVANCE, THOUGH HAS A OLDER VERSION AND NOT AS ATTRACTIVE, I DECIDED TO GO FOR IT SINCE THERE IS AN OPTION TO UPGRADE NOW. AND PERSONALLY I DISLIKED THE ROUNDED EDGES LOOK (LIKE IN ALL THE NEW MODELS). BUT I REALLY LIKED THE S2, BUT ITS OUTSIDE MY BUDGET AND ALSO WE DONT GET THOSE PIECES NOW IN MARKET.
      
      
      WILL KEEP UPDATING THIS REVIEW."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"AFTER USING FOR ABOUT AND YEAR I AM WRITING THS REVIEW .
      
      THEY CAMERA IS REALY VERY POOR AND IT DONT HAVE ZOOM FEATURE . CAMERA LIGHT IS MISSING ( NOT FLASH) WHN U TAKE A SNAP IT WILL APEAR WITH LOW BRIGHTNES AND CONTRAST U HVE TO EDIT IT.
      
      
      RAM IS DECENT ONE BUT SOME HIGHER GRAPHIC GAME WILL RUN FOR A WHILE BUT AFTER SOMETIME IT WILL HUNG UP.. YOUAHVE TO STOP IT GOING THROUGH TASK MANAGER.
      
      
      APRT FROM THESE TWO DRAWBACK , PHONE IS GOOD FOR THE PRICE OF 13500 AS I HVE PURCHASED IN 20K .. IF YOU LOKING FOR BETTER OHN GO WITH HTC ONE V OR ANY OTHR HTC PHN ..."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE ABOUT 3 WEEKS BACK AND I MUST SAY EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS GOOD EXCEPT ONE, NETWORK CONNECTIVITY IS PATHETIC!!
      
      
      THE PHONE LOSES NETWORK RECEPTION IN AREAS WHERE OTHER PHONES HAVE FULL NETWORK. IT TAKES ABOUT 5-10 MIN FOR NETWORK TO BE BACK.
      
      
      I CHECKED ONLINE AND FOUND THAT OTHERS ARE ALSO FACING THIS ISSUE."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"DID ANYONE REALISE WHY SAMSUNG RELEASED THIS PHONE AT ABOUT 24K AT THIS TIME? THERE WERE WHOLE LOT OF RUMOURS ABOUT DROP IN PRICES OF GALAXY S2 UPON THE RELEASE OF S3 AND WHICH WAS QUIET LOGICAL AND JUSTIFIED. HAD THIS PHONE NOT BEEN LAUNCHED, S2 WOULD HAVE COME IN THE SAME PRICE BRACKET AS THIS ONE. BUT SAMSUNG KNOWS THERE IS A LOT OF NAME AND FAME IN THE KITTY OF SAMSUNG FOR S2 AND THEY WANT TO CHURN OUT LAST PENNY OUT OF THE MARKET WITH S2 WIDOUT DROPPING IT'S PRICES. SO THEY LAUNCHED S ADVANCE SO THAT MID TO HIGH RANGE BUYERS WILL BE GIVEN THIS PHONE AS AN OPTION INSTEAD OF STILL PRICEY S2. S2 WILL CONTINUE TO PROOVE AS A GOLDEN GOOSE FOR SAMSUNG DUE TO THIS MOVE."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"FINALY A GOT IT..............! VALUE FOR MONEY.....................!

Galaxy S Advance,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 9TH MARCH AND WITHIN A WEEK I STARTED EXPERIENCING NETWORK PROBLEM. THE NETWORK DROPED TO ZERO CONTINUOUSLY AND THEREFORE IT REQUIRED RESTART AFTER EVERY CALL MADE OR RECEIVED. I LOOKED AT INTERNET AND FOUND THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE. I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO FLIPKART AND THEY WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO REPLACE IT
      
      I HOPE NEW PHONE DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME NETWORK PROBLEM. LETS SEE."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"I DO NOT KNOW WHERE FROM SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAVE GOT INFORMATION THAT S ADVANCE WILL BE UPDATED TO JELLY BEAN. ALL THE SHOPS SELLING SAMSUNG MOBILE EVEN SAMSUNG SMART CAFE THEY SAY THAT S ADVANCE CAN BE UPDATED TO ICS TILL NOW. BUT WHEN I ASKED SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER AND ALSO THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT THEY SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION REGARDING JELLY BEAN UPDATE AND ALSO S ADVANCE CAN NOT BE UPDATED TO ICS.
      
      ONE MORE THING I HAVE HEARD THAT SAMSUNG IS GOING TO LAUNCH S3 MINI IN COMING MONTHS ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT HAVE OFFICIAL INFORMATION WHICH WILL BE A JELLY BEAN 4 INCH PHONE PRICED AROUND 20-22K, OTHER FEATURES ARE ALSO SAME AS S ADVANCE SO I DON'T SEE ANY REASON THEY WILL GIVE S ADVANCE A JELLY BEAN UPDATE."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"I GOT THIS PHONE TO SATISFY MULTIPLE CONSTRAINTS AND OBJECTIVES. I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN A SUPER LARGE SCREEN PHONE. WANTED SOMETHING THAT COULD BE OPERATED WITH A SINGLE HAND FOR MOST USE CASES. SO 4"" WAS THE MAX SIZE. WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN A PHONE WITH SUFFICIENT MEMORY TO RUN MULTIPLE APPS - MAIL, MAPS, GOOGLE NOW, VIBER, WHATSAPP, SCHEDULER, TALK, CAMERA, TUNEIN, WITHOUT HAVING TO BOTHER ABOUT MEMORY. 1GZ DUAL CORE, 1GB WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL. ANOTHER IMPORTANT NEED WAS TO HAVE ALL 5 SENSORS, WEIGHT UNDER 130GMS AND PRICE LESS THAN 15K. BUT THERE IS NO PHONE MAKER INTERESTED IN MAKING A 4"" PHONE WITH SUCH SPECS. IT WAS VERY HARD TO LOCATE A PHONE WITH MORE THAN 512MB. FINALLY I OPTED FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE BECAUSE IT HAD 768MB AND THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION THAT IT WAS GETTING A JELLYBEAN UPGRADE VERY SOON. I GOT THE PHONE IN MY HAND ON APRIL 25TH. THE VERY SAME DAY THAT JELLYBEAN WAS OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED IN INDIA.
      
      
      WITHOUT TRYING OUT THE STOCK GINGERBREAD FOR EVEN COUPLE OF DAYS, I UPGRADED TO JELLYBEAN OVERNIGHT. IMMEDIATELY AFTER UPGRADE I FOUND THE PHONE WOULD NOT REGISTER WITH THE CELLULAR PROVIDER. FINALLY I LEARNT THE HARD WAY THAT ONE HAS TO DO A FACTORY RESET IMMEDIATELY AFTER UPGRADE. THEN I LOADED ALL MY CHOICE APPS AND LOOKED FORWARD TO SOME GOOD TIMES.
      
      
      SADLY THE PHONE WITH JELLYBEAN HAS BEEN A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. THE PHONE STARTS LAGGING WITHIN 2 DAYS OF USAGE. IF YOU DO NOT REBOOT THE PHONE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK WITH THE PHONE. IN COMPARISON MY OLD TRUSTED HTC LEGEND RUNNING FROYO SINGLE CORE 600MHZ, 384MB RAM WAS A BEAUTY. NO LAGS - EVEN WITH ALL THE ABOVE LISTED APPS IN USE FOR WEEKS.
      
      
      THE SAMSUNG TOUCHWIZ DIALER AND SMS APPS ARE PRIMITIVE. ON A 3.2"" SCREEN THE HTC LEGEND DISPLAYED FAR MORE TEXT THAN THE GALAXY ADVANCE ON A 4"" SCREEN. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT LOAD CHOMP SMS AND DIALER EX. THE STOCK CLOCK WIDGET IS CRIPPLED. UNLIKE SENSEUI'S WIDGET YOU CANNOT ACCESS CLOCK SETTINGS AND ALARM SETTINGS FROM THE SAME WIDGET. OH! HOW I MISS THE SENSEUI.
      
      
      OVER THE WEEKS AND LOTS OF GOOGLING AND DOING FACTORY RESETS TWICE, I HAVE COME TO REALIZE THE 768MB MEMORY IS JUST INADEQUATE. OUT OF 768 ONLY 624 IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE. AFTER A FRESH REBOOT THE PHONE BEGINS WITH 400MB OCCUPIED. AND PRETTY SOON IT HAS 50MB FREE. AND IF THE USAGE PATTERN CONTINUES THEN IN 2~ 3 DAYS THE PHONE WILL HAVE 6~7MB FREE. YES ANDROID IS SUPPOSED TO MANAGE MEMORY SMARTLY ETC. NONE OF THAT IS SEEN IN ACTION. FIDDLING WITH DEVELOPER OPTIONS ALSO PROVES TO BE OF NO HELP.
      
      
      THE ONLY WAY TO MANAGE THE PHONE IS TO ACTIVELY KICK OUT APPLICATIONS (THE BACK BUTTON DOES NOT EXIT THEM) USING THE BUILT IN TASK MANAGER LAUNCHED VIA LONG PRESS OF THE HOME BUTTON. USING THIRD PARTY TASK MANAGERS/KILLERS HAS BEEN UNHELPFUL - IN FACT THEY MADE THE PHONE WORSE.
      
      
      BOTTOM LINE I HAVE COME TO REALIZE I SHOULD ROLL BACK TO GINGERBREAD. THE ONLY ADVANTAGE OF JELLYBEAN IS HAVING GOOGLE NOW. SO SHOULD I WAIT FOR SAMSUNG TO FIX THE MEMORY USAGE IN A 4.2.1/2 UPGRADE OR DO THE ROLL BACK ASAP ! (THEIR DALVIK CACHE SETTING OF 256MB FOR A 768MB RAM PHONE IS THE KILLER) (I DON'T WISH TO ROOT PHONES)
      
      
      PHONE BATTERY LIFE IS AVERAGE - WITH WIFI/GPS/MOBILEDATA/SYNC ON ALL DAY (AND I HAVE WIFI COVERAGE MOST OF THE TIME EXCEPT WHEN MOVING ON THE ROAD), THE PHONE TAKEN OFF CHARGER IN THE MORNING SHOWS 50% CHARGE LEFT AT THE END OF THE DAY AFTER 13/4 HOURS WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF CALLS AND SMS AND BROWSING/MAP/FACEBOOK. I DON'T USE THE PHONE FOR GAMES.
      
      
      ERGONOMICALLY THE SONY EXPERIA P IS MUCH EASIER TO OPERATE WITH A SINGLE HAND THAN THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE - EVEN THOUGH BOTH ARE 4"" SCREENS - THE SONY IS 5 MM LESS WIDE. THAT HELPS A LOT.
      
      
      I GOT A MOLIFE SILICONE CASE WITH FREE SCREENGUARD. THE SILICON CASE IS OK. THE POWER AND VOLUME SWITCH INDENTATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PRONOUNCED. IT IS HARD TO LOCATE THEM BY FEEL. THE SCREENGUARD IS AN UTTER FAILURE - HUGE FINGER PRINT MAGNET.
      
      
      OVERALL THE PHONE HAS BEEN A LET DOWN. I WISH I COULD GET BACK THE HTC LEGEND EXPERIENCE ON A LARGER SCREEN."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THE ORIGINAL BATTERY FOR REPLACING MY PHONE'S BATTERY BUT I AM FINDING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IT. I CONTACTED QUITE A FEW STORES IN BANGALORE AND ALSO CHECKED SAMSUNGS' ESTORE, IT WAS NOT THERE. FLIPKART DOES NOT HAVE IT. ONE OF MY FRIEND IN PUNE ALSO VERIFIED THAT HE TOO WAS NOT ABLE TO GET THE ORIGINAL BATTERY. I CAN ONLY SEE SELLERS FROM CHINA/HONG KONG SELLING THIS ORIGINAL BATTERY ONLINE BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY RISK AND BUY THEIR GOODS. WHAT IS THE USE OF PAYING SO MUCH AND BUYING THE PHONE WHEN YOU CANNOT GET A REPLACEMENT BATTERY FOR THIS? I WOULD WARN EVERYONE TO AVOID THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"I PURCHASED GALAXY S ADVANCE FROM FLIPKART. THE PHONE IS NICE IN CONFIGURATION.
      
      BUT MY HANDSET GOT  ONE DEFECT FROM DAY FIRST. ITS 'BACK' KEY LOCATED AT BOTTOM RIGHT IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY. SOMETIMES IT STOPS RESPONDING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES IT AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERS BACK COMMAND EVEN WITHOUT TOUCHING IT.
      
      
      THE MAJOR DEFICIENCY I CAN SEE IN PHONE DESIGN IS THAT ITS CAMERA DOES NOT HAVE ZOOM FACILITY. AFTER UPGRADING TO ANDROID JELLY BEAN WE CAN HAVE A 2X ZOOM BUT SAMSUNG HAS NOT YET PROVIDED OFFICIAL UPGRADE FOR THIS PHONE. IT IS STILL RUNNING ON ANDROID 2.3.6 GINGERBREAD."
Galaxy S Advance,3,I'M GIVING 3 STAR TO THIS MOBILE BECAUSE OF ITS BAD SPEAKER. OTHERWISE A GOOD MOBILE TO BUY IN THIS RANGE. FLIPKART SERVICE IS VERY GOOD AGAIN AND I'M SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THE PRODUCT IN 1 DAY. THAT TOO ON A SUNDAY!!!
Galaxy S Advance,3,"I'M PLANING TO BUY THIS PHONE
      
      BUT 80% INDIAN USER SAY THIS PHONE HAS NETWORK PROBLEMS
      
      ANY SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM
      
      PLZ TELL ME
      
      
      THANKS"
Galaxy S Advance,3,"IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY GREAT DEVICE, IF SAMSUNG HAS GIVEN LITTLE MORE ATTENTION TO THEIR SO CALL PREMIUM MID-RANGE DEVICE.
      
      
      A. 1.3MP FRONT CAMERA - VERY GOOD IN FACT FOR A PHONE OF THE CLASS
      
      B. 5.0MP REAR CAMERA - AS EXPECTED FROM A MIDRANGE DEVICE - BUT A PRETTY DECENT ONE
      
      C. 16GB RAM - AGAIN VERY GOOD FOR A DEVICE OF ITS CLASS.
      
      D. A WEB BROWSER WITH FLASH DIVX AND ALL OTHER CODEC SUPPORT - EXCELLENT
      
      E. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY - NOT REALLY A GOOD ONE - SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPER AMOLED PLUS - BUT ACCEPTABLE
      
      F. ANDROID GINGER BREAD - DEFINITELY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ICS OUT OF THE BOX OR ATLEAST AN ASSURANCE - WHEN.
      
      G. 1500MAH BATTERY - PRETTY AVERAGE WITH ONE FULL DAY USAGE EXPECTED. WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE USER EXPERIENCE FOR IT.
      
      I. 4"" DISPLAY - PRETTY COOL AND SINGLE HANDED USE - BUT A 4"" DISPLAY SCREEN PHONE SHOULD HAVE A SIZE WITH LENGTH LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 120MM TO MEET THE PURPOSE. 123MM IT LITTLE BIG.
      
      J. BUILD QUALITY - NOT PRETTY IMPRESSIVE WITH HARD PLASTICS. HIGH TIME FOR SAMSUNG TO BE INNOVATIVE OF THE DESIGN. THE BACK COVER IS EXTREMELY THIN PLASTIC WHICH AT TIMES FEELS IT WILL BREAK WHEN YOU PULL IT OUT. ONE WOULD DEFINITELY DESERVE A BUILD QUALITY OF HTC ONE V AT LEAST FOR THIS PRICE.
      
      J. WEIGHT - REASONABLE - IMPRESSIVE
      
      K. CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS AND SENSORS ARE GOOD ENOUGH
      
      L. THE PROCESSOR AND RAM AND GOOD ENOUGH FOR A DEVICE OF THE CLASS TO SERVE THE PURPOSE OF THE USERS.
      
      M. PRICE TAG - WELL... ITS WAY BEYOND REALITY. WITH THE UNIMPRESSIVE BUILD QUALITY AND BEING A MID-RANGE DEVICE IT SHOULD STAND BETWEEN 18-21K.
      
      
      ON THE WHOLE - SGSA DECENTLY AND IMPRESSIVELY FEATURED MIDRANGE DEVICE WITH UNIMPRESSIVE BUILD QUALITY AND POOR PRICING
      
      
      MOTOROLA ATRIX 2 IS A SOLIDLY BUILD DEVICE WITH EXCELLENT BATTERY BACK UP WITH FEW THOUSANDS LESS THAN SGSA. BUT IT IS BIT HEAVY, HAVE A 4.3 INCH SCREEN AND NO AMOLED DISPLAY"
Galaxy S Advance,3,"IT'S WORKING GREAT BUT WITH ONE DRAWBACK THAT IS IS SOMETIMES GETS HANGED AND I'VE TO RESTART THE PHONE. OTHERWISE EXCELLENT PHONE. YOU CAN ADD MANY COOL APPS WHICH WORKS GREAT AND U CAN UNINSTAL SOFTWARES AT ANY TIME. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY HAD PROVIDED AN ANTIVIRUS SOFWARE, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL ANY ANTIVIRUS IN YOUR MOBILE AT ANY TIME. THE PACK DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY MOBILE COVER SO YOU HAVE TO BUY YOURSELF."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"PHONE IS PACKED WITH BEST FEATURES IN A LOWER PRICE LIKE DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY. BUT FACE PROBLEMS LIKE YOU CAN NOT ZOOM TO CLICK A PHOTO, MAKES CAMERA USELESS.
      
      VIDEO QUALITY IS VERY GOOD BUT SAME ZOOM ISSUE IRRITATES.
      
      NO CURRENT SUPPORT FOR ICS/JELLY BEAN CAN BE A MAJOR DRAWBACKS.
      
      MUSIC IS NOT SAMSUNG'S CUP OF TEA, SO NO NEED TO WRITE ABOUT THAT.. OVERALL A GOOD PHONE IF U ARE OK WITH AVERAGE CAMERA N MUSIC."
Galaxy S Advance,3,"REALLY NO ONE THINKS ABOUT GOOD SPECS WHEN THERE IS UNMATCHABLE PRICE...
      
      WAS WAITING FROM LAST 2 MONTHS, NOW I DONT THINK I WILL PURCHASE THIS
      
      WE KNOW SONY HAS GREAT PHONE TO REVEAL IN FEW DAYS THATS XPERIA P WHICH I THINK IS IN SAME PRICE RANGE AND IS BETTER !
      
      EVEN XPERIA SOLA IS GREAT TO ITS PRICE TAG ONLY LACKS FRONT FACING CAM AND A BIG BATTERY !!!"
Galaxy S Advance,3,SAMSUNG IS PLANNING TO DISCONTINUE THIS MODEL. IF U DNT BELIEVE ME THEN FEEL FREE TO CHECK THE INTERNET.THIS IS A NICE PHONE BUT HAD SOME SERIOUS NETWORK N CONNECTIVITY PROBS.BTW IF U STILL WANNA BUY IT  HERZ A GOOD THING FOR U -YOU'LL GET JELLYBEAN UPDATE.
Galaxy S Advance,3,"THANK GOD I BOUGHT GALAXY R FOR 21K JUST BEFORE IT WAS STOPPED... ADVANCE COSTS 3K MORE BUT HAS LESS RAM AND SCREEN SIZE(4"") THAN R(4.2"").. ONLY UPGRADE IN ADVANCE IS AMOLED DISPLAY BESIDES R GOT SUPER LCD WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD UNLESS U DECIDE TO WATCH A MOVIE OR VIDEO UNDER SUN.. &AMP; SAMSUNG HAS PROMISED ICS FOR R WHICH I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME :(  SO IF U WENT QUICK SOFTWARE UPDATES,IT'S BETTER TO GO FOR SONY OR HTC.. I RECOMMEND HTC PHONES THOUGH"
Galaxy S Advance,3,"WE MAY NOT GET ANDROID UPDATE TO 4.1 IN NEAR FUTURE WHICH IS THE MAIN DRAW BACK TO THIS PHONE AND I AM FACING CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WITH THIS PHONE .....PLEASE WAIT FOR SOME MORE DAYS ,THE PRICE OF SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE I9070  WILL COME TO 11 K"
Galaxy S Advance,2,A FRIEND OF MINE HAD BOUGHT THIS MOBILE A MONTH AGO. HE MANAGED TO UPGRADE IT TO JELLY BEAN AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A TERRIBLE DECISION. THE MOBILE HAS SLOWED DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY AND IT JUST DOESN'T RESPOND. CAMERA IS WORST AS ALWAYS. DON'T BE A VICTIM OF SAMSUNG'S CHEAP PLASTIC DEVICES. BEST OPTION IS TO GO FOR SONY OR LG. AT LEAST YOU DON'T END UP REGRETTING (LIKE MY FRIEND DOES NOW).....
Galaxy S Advance,2,"ALTHOUGH THE SPECS FOR THIS PHONE ARE GOOD FOR THIS PRICE SEGMENT AND THIS PHONE DOES HAVE DURABILITY, IT LOOKS SOO DUMB!
      
      
      A SMARTPHONE IS SOMETHING THAT WE USE EVERYDAY AND ALMOST ALL THE TIME. I DONT KNOW ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE, BUT I WOULDN'T BARE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING SO CHEAP AND DUMB IN LOOKS ALL THE TIME. I HATE SAMSUNGS'S DESIGNING... RIGHT FROM GALAXY Y TO S4, EVERYTHING'S THE SAME! UGH...."
Galaxy S Advance,2,EXCEPT INTERNAL MEMORY AND OTHER FEW THINGS MOTOROLA ATRIX 2 IS FAR BETTER THAN THIS SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE BETTER COMPARE BOTH OF THEM BEFORE BUYING .MORE OVER I AM FED UP WITH THE SAME OLD SAMSUNG LOOK ITS REALLY BORING AFTER A FEW WEEKS AND THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH MOTO IS THAT WE DAONT HAVE MUCH SERVICE CENTERS IN INDIA BUT THAT IS NOT A VERY BIG PROBLEM
Galaxy S Advance,2,"GUYS,
      
      
      YES, THE PRICE IS DOWN FROM 23 TO 19.5K, WHICH SOUND REALLY GOOD FOR THE PHONE BUYERS, BUT GUESS WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON FOR THE PRICE TO GO DOWN SO MUCH?
      
      
      I'M CURRENTLY USING THIS PHONE, I WAS FELT VERY HAPPY WITH THE FEATURES OFFERS, REALLY LOVED THE PHONE, BUT THEN STUCK THE BAD LUCK AGAIN TO ME, THIS PHONE WAS A BRILLIANT DEAL TILL THE TIME NETWORK ISSUES HIT (VODAFONE GSM AND AIRTEL GSM BOTH TRIES AND TESTED)!!
      
      YES THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WELL, LOSSES NETWORK AFTER EVERY CALL AND EVEN DURING CALL YOU CAN SEE THE NETWORK BAR GOING DOWN AND PERSON ON OTHER END IS STRUGGLING TO HEAR YOU, THIS IS NOT ONLY THE ISSUE.. IT SHOW NO NETWORK CROSS BAR AT TIME AND YOU NEEDS TO RESTARTED, OR MAKE IT TO FLIGHT MODE THEN CHANGE BACK SWITCH OFF THE FLIGHT MODE TO PICK UP NETWORK AGAIN. WHAT?S THE USE OF A PHONE WHICH CANNOT CONNECT YOU TO INTERNET TO CHECK FB OR GOOGLE OR EVEN MAKE YOUR PHONE NOT REACHABLE WHEN YOUR IN MAIN CITY NETWORK AREA. IF YOU ARE A TRAVELER, THEN FORGET THAT YOU WILL GET THE NETWORK BACK WHEN YOU REACH NEXT CITY. PLEASE RESTART PHONE ONCE YOU REACH YOUR DESTINATION.
      
      
      THERE IS ""NO ZOOM IN"" OPTION AVAILABLE TO CLICK PHOTOS WITH CAMERA. 2.3 ANDROID WORKS WELL NO COMPLAINS ON THAT, BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR ICS TO FIX THE CAMERA ZOOM IN ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      MY BACK LUCK WAS THAT I BROUGHT THE PHONE WITHOUT READING THE REVIEWS ON THE SAMSUNGS MAIN WEBSITE!! BEFORE THIS I HAD APPLE I3 WHICH WAS FROM US WHICH LOST NETWORK BECAUSE OF JAIL GARAGE IMPROPERLY DONE AND I USED NOKIA C-6-00, ANOTHER MODEL WITH GOOD FEATURES BUT NO RAM AND NO GOOD PROCESSER THIS PHONE ALSO USE TO LOOSE NETWORK.
      
      PLEASE DO READ MORE REVIEWS ON THE SAMSUNGS MAIN WEBSITE TO KNOW THE TRUE COLOUR OF THIS PHONE. IT WAS NOT REPAIRED OR REPLACED BY SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE BUT REFUNDED COMPLETE MONEY TO ONE IT?S CUSTOMER, I WAS NOT SO LUCKY.
      
      BUY ANY OTHER PHONE BUT NOT THIS ONE WITH 19- 20K IN HAND. I?M STILL STUCK WITH THIS PHONE (MIND IT - I BROUGHT THIS PHONE @ 23K)."
Galaxy S Advance,2,"HEY GUYS I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE AFTER A LONG RESEARCH BUT NOW AFTER USING IT FOR 6 MONTHS HERE IS MY REVIEW
      
      PHONE LOOKS GUD BUT HAVE A NETWORK ISSUE AT LEAST IN MY HANDSET
      
      BATTERY IS ALSO NOT AS LONG LASTING AS IT HV BEEN CLAIMED BY SAMSUNG ND SOME USERS ON FLIPKART
      
      GPS IS ALSO NOT WORKING THOUGH WIFI CONNECTIVITY IS GUD
      
      WORKING SPEED OF THE HANDSET IS GUD TOUCH IS ALSO GUD
      
      AND DON'T KNOW HOW SOME PPL R GETTING THEIR HANDSETS UPDATED
      
      I WILL GIVE ONLY 2.5 POINTS"
Galaxy S Advance,2,"IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT PHONE FOR 19-20K BUT THE PRICE..OOOOOOOPS.. BETTER GO FAR XPERIA P WCH S GREAT PHONE WCH COSTS JUST 500 MORE WIT 8 MPX CAMERA AND 1 GB RAM(EVEN XPERIA P S OVER PRICED ).
      
      
      2 RATING FOR THIS PHONE, 3 PENALTY FOR PRICING OR ELSE 5 OUT OF 5 IF ITS AROUND 19-20K..."
Galaxy S Advance,2,"PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE:
      
      1 . NO ICS ITS RUN ON OUTDATED ANDROID
      
      2 . VERY HIGH PRICE IN COMPARISON WHAT U R GETTING.
      
      3 . SAME BORING DESIGN AND PLASTIC BODY
      
      4 . POOR SAMSUNGS TRACK RECORD IN GIVING UPDATE ( REMEMBER ONLY GALAXY S2 , R , NOTE GETTING ICS ) SO THIS WILL DIE WITH GINGERBREAD ONLY.
      
      
      BETTER DEAL : XPERIA SOLA , XPERIA P , GALAXY TAB2"
Galaxy S Advance,2,"THE PHONE IS GOOD WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS POINT OF VIEW BUT THE TOW BACKLOGS ARE:
      
      
      1) JELLY BEAN UPGRADE IS REQUIRED IN INDIA AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES IS ALREADY RELEASED
      
      2) OPTIMUM ZOOMING IS NOT THERE AND IT IS REQUIRED FOR THIS PHONE COMPOLSURY"
Galaxy S Advance,2,"THE PHONE IS GOOD. BUT THE BATTERY DOES NOT EVEN LAST FOR 8 TO 10 HOURS, EVEN THOUGH I DO NOT USE IT MUCH. I KEEP GOING TO TASK MANAGER TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY APPS RUNNING AND CLOSING THEM, BUT DOESN'T HELP. HAVE TRIED FOLLOWING DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS FROM THE SAMSUNG FORUMS, BUT OF NO USE.
      
      
      MOTOROLA ATRIX 2 IS A MUCH BETTER PHONE COMPARED TO THIS."
Galaxy S Advance,2,"THIS PHONE DOESN'T HAVE ZOOM ... SO WHAT'S THE USE OF 5 MP CAMERA ??
      
      AND I HAVE HEARD ABOUT NETWORK ISSUES TOO .. MAY BE THAT'S WHU ITS PRICE DROPPED DOWN :P
      
      BUT NO MOBILE PHONE COMES WITH ALL THESE FEATURES IN THIS PRICE :P IT HAS GOT NICE PROCESSOR , LARGE SCREEN AND A SECONDARY CAMERA :D"
Galaxy S Advance,1,""" UNKNOWN ERROR BY ERROR CALL BACK ""
      
      THIS IS THE WARNING I AM GETTING IN MY SCREEN WHEN I TRIED TO OPERATE THE CAMERA IN THIS PHONE FOR THE FIRST TIME . I HAVEN'T STARTED USING IT .... WILL POST MORE LATER ABOUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE"
Galaxy S Advance,1,"1. SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE IS A PHONE WITH GREAT FEATURES LIKE (AMOLED SCREEN, 4INCH DISPLAY, ETC)
      
      2. BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE CAMERA,  DUST IS GETTING FILLED INSIDE THE CAMERA (WHICH CAN BE CLEANED ONLY BY THE SERVICE PERSONNEL).
      
      3. I CLEANED IT FOR MORE THAN 3 TIMES TILL 26TH AUGUST 2012. AND NOW AGAIN THE PRIMARY CAMERA FILLED WITH DUST.
      
      4. SAMSUNG CUSTOMER CARE, A VERY HORRIBLE SERVICE, THE LOCAL SERVICE CENTER GAVE THE PHONE NUMBER OF SAMSUNG CALL CENTER, AND WHEN I CALL THE SAMSUNG CALL CENTER, THEY GAVE THE MANAGER'S NUMBER OF THE LOCAL SERVICE CENTRE.
      
      5. AFTER 1 YEAR (IF THE WARRANTY EXPIRES), WE NEED TO CLEAN THE CAMERA BY PAYING SERVICE CHARGES.
      
      NO USE, DONT GO FOR IT, IF YOU WANT TO GO, THEN DONT BOTHER ABOUT THE CAMERA.
      
      SEARCH IN THE WEB, THERE ARE SO MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PHONE MAINLY THE DUST IN THE CAMERA....."
Galaxy S Advance,1,"ALTHOUGH IT HAS MALI 400, BUT IT DOES NOT PLAY FULL HD 1080P VIDEO. I TRY TO PLAY 1920?1080 MP4 AND 1920?1080 AVI VIDEO, BUT ONLY SOUND PLAY WITH BLACK SCREEN.

      HAVE READ ABOUT THIS OVER THE NET N CAME TO KNOW THAT ALMOST ALL THE OWNERS OF THIS MODEL ARE FACING SAME PROBLEM.
      
      AS OF NOW I HAVE GIVEN MY PHONE FOR MOTHERBOARD REPLACEMENT.BUT I DONT HAVE NE HOPES AS MANY USERS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT EVEN AFTER MOTHERBOARD REPLACEMENT THE PROBLEM PERSISTS.
      
      LETS C WHAT SAMSUNG DOES WITH MY HANDSET...
      
      PROSPECTIVE BUYERS BE CAUTIONS WHILE BUYING SUCH A COSTLY PHONE...!!!"
Galaxy S Advance,1,"EVEN THOUGH AT THIS PRICE RANGE, ITS A NICE PHONE,BUT MY FRIEND HAD RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS PHONE ND HE IS FACING PROBLEMS!!
      
      WITHIN A DAY OR TWO,HIS PHONE STARTED HEATING UP,AND SHOWED VARIOUS OTHER PROBLEMS LYK AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN,EVEN THE JELLYBEAN UPDATE HAD SOME SERIOUS PROBLEM.HE WENT TO THE CUSTOMER CARE,BEING A SAMSUNG CARE OUTLET,PEOPLE DIDNT ATTEND TO HIS PROBLEM PROPERLY,SAYING THAT THIS PHONE'S MANUFACTURING HAS BEEN STOPPED,SO THEY DONT HAVE ANY NEW ONES,TO REPLACE THIS ONE,AND THE 7 DAY REPLACEMENT SCHEME WONT BE VALID FOR THIS MODEL!!
      
      (IF YOUR PHONE MALFUNCTIONS WITHIN 7DAYS OF BUYING IT,THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY THAT IT WOULD REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE.)
      
      DEY SAID,THE MOTHERBOARD IS FAULTY AND WOULD REPLACE IT,BUT EVEN AFTER DEY DID,D PROBLEMS PERSISTED...
      
      NOW HES THINKING TO SELL THIS,AND BUY A NEW PHONE...
      
      SO,PLEASE,THINK BEFORE U BUY THIS PHONE,TRY SAMSUNG S DUOS INSTEAD,OR GO WID SONY..."
Galaxy S Advance,1,"FINALLY I GOT THE PHONE THANKS TO FLIP KART FOR THEIR QUICK DELIVERY.
      
      I COULD NOT LOCATE THIS PHONE IN THE OPEN MARKET MOST OF THE SHOP OWNER SAID THIS PHONE IS FACED OUT NOT SURE IF THAT WAS A MYTH.
      
      BUT AFTER SEEING THIS PHONE NO ONE IN MY FRIENDS OBJECTED TO THIS PHONE. EVERYONE WAS HAPPY THAT I MADE A GOOD DECISION TO CHOSE THIS PHONE.
      
      WAITING FOR JELLY BEAN UPDATE AND THAT WOULD BE THE REAL TEST FOR THIS PHONE.
      
      
      ONLY THING ...WHY PURE WHITE HEADSET WITH A BLACK COLOR PHONE???!!!"
Galaxy S Advance,1,"HERE ARE MY OBSERVATIONS FOLLOWING 30 DAYS AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. HD RECORDING IS REALLY GOOD.
      
      2.DUAL CAMERA IS A PLUS FOR VIDEO CONFERENCING
      
      3.SCREEN RESOLUTION AND COLORS ARE VERY FINE.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. NOT SO HANDY. UNIMPRESSIVE BUILD MAKES IT TOUGH TO GRAB COMFORTABLY. PRONE TO SLIP OFF.
      
      2. 5 MP CAMERA IS AWFULLY DISAPPOINTING WHEN TAKING PICS (ALTHOUGH GOOD FOR VIDEO RECORDING......DONT KNOW WHY). PIC SIZE IS GREATER THAN 1 MB BUT QUALITY IS BELOW PAR. MY PREVIOUS NOKIA 5233 2MP WAS WAY FAR BETTER THAN THIS. PICS QUALITY IS FINE ONLY IF THERE IS PLENTY OF DAYLIGHT AND ARE TAKEN WITHIN 2-3 METRES.
      
      3. ANTENNA RECEPTION POWER IS VERY POOR. SIGNALS GET LOST OFTEN (TO BE NOTED I RESIDE IN SOUTH DELHI, SO NO EXCUSE GRANTED)
      
      4. AUTOMATIC SCREEN LOCK IS EXTREMELY TEDIOUS. WILL LOCK/UNLOCK ON ITS OWN WILL, NOT YOURS. NEED MORE THAN FEW ATTEMPTS SOMETIMES.
      
      5. BATTERY OF COURSE IS A BIG DRAWBACK. SHOULD HAVE BEEN ATLEAST 2100MAH INSTEAD OF 1500MAH.
      
      5. WOULD START HANGING OFTEN ONCE YOU INSTALL LIKE MORE THAN 10 NICE APPS OR SO, OR EVEN WHEN YOUR STORAGE STARTS RUNNING OUT OF SPACE. INTERFACE NOT SO SMOOTH AS WOULD HAVE EXPECTED.
      
      6. NO JELLY BEAN UPDATE TILL DATE.
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT:
      
      I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE AT ALL. OVERLY PRICED (WORTH NOT MORE THAN 15K) AND LOW PERFORMANCE PHONE DESPITE HAVING DUAL CORE ARM CORTEX 9. FOR CONNOISSEURS OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, I RECOMMEND STRONGLY TO GO FOR SONY OR NOKIA ONLY - TRIED, TRUSTED AND RELIABLE."
Galaxy S Advance,1,"HI GUYS,
      
      I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF FLIPKART FOR HEIR SERVICE FOR PAST 1 YEAR AND THIS TIME ALSO THEYY SURPRISED ME WITH NEXT DAY DELIVERY. SO KUDOS TO DAT !!
      
      
      AND NOW ABOUT THE PRODUCT, LOOKS ARE GOOD BUT DECEPTIVE, I HAD OPTIONS LIKE HTC DESIRE X, XPERIA NEO L AND CANVAS HD. BUT DUE TO BRAND VAKUE AND THE EXPECTED JB UPDATE I TOKK S ADVANCE. ONLY AFTER TWO DAYS MY EXCITEMENT WAS OVER. TH DEVICE DOESNOT SUPPORTS MULTITASKING AT ALL. I ONLY STARTED SKYPE HANGOUT, FACEBOOK WATSAPP AND THRE IT WAS "" FORCEFUL SHUT DOWN "" I WAS SHOCKED AND AGONISED. I TRIED AGAIN NEXT DAY BUT SAME THING HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE AAILABLE 555 MB RAM IS ALWAYS POPULATED WITH 384 MB.
      
      ANOTHER THING IS WHEN I CHECKED FOR UPDATE, THERE WAS NO UPDATE AVAILABLE. AGAIM DISHEARTENED :(
      
      NOW I AM FEELING CHEATED AFTER BUYING THIS. ITS WELL SAID "" SASTA ROYE BAAAR BAAR , MEHNGA ROYE EK BAAR """
Galaxy S Advance,1,"HI I PURCHASED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART. AFTER READING THE REVIEWS
      
      
      BUT TO MY SURPRISE NO ONE HAS MENTIONED THE PIXELS WHICH CAN BE SEEN BY NAKED EYES. HARD TO READ SMALL TEXTS, SMALL TEXT LOOKS BLURRY .. U HAVE TO ZOOM TO READ THE WEBPAGE CONTENTS.
      
      
      GALAXY S DUOS S7562 HAS 4 INCH DISPLAY WITH 800X480 RESOLUTION.. AND ITS SCREEN IS FAR MUCH BETTER WHILE READING WEBPAGE CONTENTS.
      
      
      PHONE IS LOADED WITH FEATURES NO DOUBT COLORS ARE GOOD SCREEN VIEWING ANGLE IS GREAT.
      
      
      BUT PIXELATION IN THE SCREEN HAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME..
      
      
      I THINK I WILL NEVER BUY THE PHONE AGAIN BY READING THE REVIEWS."
Galaxy S Advance,1,"I BOUGHT IT FOR RS. 23500 WHEN IT WAS JUST LAUNCHED. THE NETWORK PROBLEM WITH THE PHONE IS MASSIVE. MOST CALLS GET DROPPED IN THE MIDDLE. OFTEN THE PHONE GOES OUT OF NETWORK AND DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY ACQUIRE THE NETWORK AGAIN. IT NEEDS TO BE RESTARTED. SOMETIMES, EVEN AFTER RESTARTING, THE NETWORK DOES NOT COME BACK. INTERNET DOES NOT WORK. SAME AIRTEL SIM WORKS FINE ON MY SPICE PHONE. INTERNET ON AIRTEL IS VERY FAST ON SPICE PHONE, BUT DEAD SLOW ON SAMSUNG I9070. THE LCD DISPLAY STARTED BLINKING AFTER ONE MONTH OF USE WHICH WAS REPLACED BY SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER IN CHANDIGARH. NOW THEY SAY, THE NETWORK PROBLEM IS BECAUSE OF AIRTEL 64K SIM. THEY WANT ME TO USE ANOTHER TELECOM PROVIDER. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. IF AIRTEL WORKS FINE ON CHEAPER SPICE PHONE, WHY NOT ON SAMSUNG. BY THE WAY, THIS PHONE IS STILL SOLD WITH ANCIENT ANDROID 2.3 GINGERBREAD. BETTER TO AVOID THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S Advance,1,I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE FROM FLIPKART AND LATER ON I UPDATED THIS MODEL TO OFFICIAL JELLY BEAN.NOW PHONE IS FREEZEING UP LIKE HELL I AM NOT ABLE TO USE AND EVEN THERE IS ECHO COMES FROM SPEAKER...SO PLZ DONT BUY THIS PHONE
Galaxy S Advance,1,I DIDNT FIND ANYTHING ADVANCED AS SUCH OUT OF THIS PHONE AS THIS HAS THE SAME 2.3.6 OS.. AND SIMILAR SPECS THAT OF GALAXY R... ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING A SMALLER SCREEN THAN R.. PLEASE SAMSUNG.. STOP YOUR CONVENTIONAL MODELS AND ENHANCE YOUR CREATIVITY.. RELEASE MODELS LIKE GALAXY BEAM IN INDIA TO BETTER YOUR MARKET SHARE. CHANGING THE NAME OF EARLIER RELEASED PHONES WILL NOT HLD GOOD FOR YOU IN ANY WAYS... HOPE MY REVIEW REACHES TO ATLEAST ONE PERSON IN SAMSUNG..
Galaxy S Advance,1,"I PURCHASED NEW S ADVANCE FROM SAMSUNG GALLERY THANE. FROM BEGINNING I STARTED GETTING NETWORK ISSUES. THOUGH EVERYBODY IN VICINITY GETS NETWORK SUDDENLY MY PHONE'S NETWORK IS GONE. FRIENDS GET ME UNAVAILABLE. I IMMEDIATELY DEMANDED THE REPLACEMENT, BUT WAS TURNED AWAY BY THE DEALER ASKING ME TO GO TO THE SAMSUNG SERVICE STATION. IN SERVICE STATION SOME SETTINGS WERE CHANGED &AMP; ALSO SOME SOFTWARE UPDATE WAS MADE TELLING ME THAT SOME MODELS HAVE SOME ISSUES. (IMPLICITLY ADMITTING THE DEFECT), IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SAME I STILL GET NETWORK AVAILABILITY ISSUES. NOW I WAS SUGGESTED TO CHANGE THE SIM CARD, SO I CHANGED MY VODAFONE SIM. STILL THE ERROR PERSISTS. I AM NOW CLUELESS ABOUT WHAT TO DO.
      
      
      THE PHONE WITH GOOD FEATURES BUT BASICALLY LAGGING IN THE BASIC COMMUNICATIONS IS USELESS.  WHAT IS MORE DISTURBING IS THAT SAMSUNG BEING SUCH A REPUTED BRAND IN INDIA, THE RESPONSE TO THE COMPLAINT FOR REPLACEMENT IS BEING DECLINED. NOT EXPECTED FROM SAMSUNG :-(  .. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT"
Galaxy S Advance,1,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED A GALAXY S ADVANCE PHONE, GT I9070, THE PHONE IS JUST 9 DAYS OLD AND FOR SOME REASON SWITCHES OFF ON ITS OWN.
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF THE APPLE SERIES OF PRODUCTS AND HAVE AN IPHONE AND AN IPAD. I PURCHASED THIS PHONE TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THE ANDROID ATMOSPHERE. HOWEVER I REGRET MY DECISION FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.
      
      
      1.) OF THE 9 DAYS THAT I HAVE HAD THIS PHONE IT HAS SPENT 3 DAYS IN THE SERVICE STATION.
      
      
      2.) THERE IS NO PROCEDURE OF PROVIDING THE CUSTOMER WITH A REPLACEMENT PHONE WHEN THE PHONE IS TAKEN FOR SERVICE.
      
      
      3.) WHENEVER I ASK WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PHONE, THE STANDARD REPLY IS '' THE PHONE IS ON TRIAL''. IF YOU WANT THE PHONE ON TRIALS PLEASE DONT LAUNCH IT IN MARKET.
      
      
      4) THERE IS NO REPLY TO EMAILS TO YOUR CUSTOMER CARE CENTRES. THIS IS IN STARK CONTRAST TO MY IPHONE AND IPAD EXPERIENCE. ALL MY EMAILS WERE PROMPTLY REPLIED TO AND THE PHONE NEVER EVER HAD ANY HARDWARE PROBLEM!
      
      
      I REALLY REGRET THE DAY I PURCHASED A SAMSUNG PHONE. WHILE I WILL TAKE ALL POSSIBLE RECOURSE, INCLUDING LEGAL TO GET A SERVICEABLE PHONE, THIS HAS REALLY LEFT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH AND I AM EXTREMELY PUT OFF BY SAMSUNG QUALITY AND FEEDBACK."
Galaxy S Advance,1,"ITS CRAP, WITHOUT ZOOM THIS PHONE GONNA BE BIGGEST DUD. IS THERE A WAY OUT TO HAVE ZOOM IN THIS PHONE. OR ELSE I HAVE TO CHANGE MY MIND. REST OF THE FEATURED SOUNDS GOOD. PLEASE BRING OUT GUYS IF THERE IS ANY OTHER BLUNDER IN THIS MOBILE?"
Galaxy S Advance,1,"MY LCD HAD THE PROBLEM WITH THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S I9003, I HAVE GIVEN THE PHONE TO THE SERVICE CENTER AND STILL WAITING FOR THE LCD TO COME FROM SAMSUNG NOIDA. IT IS ALMOST TEN DAYS OVER THEY HAVE JUST SCRAPPED THE PRODUCT AND RELEASED ADVANCED VERSION WITH NEW NAME. THE PAIN OF THE PHONE WILL NOT BE FELT UNTIL YOU GO TO THE SERVICE CENTER FOR ANY DEFECT. THEY ALSO DONT HAVE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. NEVER BUY THIS KIND OF SMART PHONE WERE THE SERVICE PROVIDED IN THE SERVICE CENTER IS WORST. SPENDING THOUSANDS OF RUPEES IN PHONE WERE THE SERVICE IS TOTALLY WASTE. JUST SIX  MONTHS OVER AND THEY HAVE REMOVED THE GALAXY S 19003 PRODUCTION. THEY SCRAP THE MODEL WITHIN YEARS AND THAN TO GET THE SERVICE IN CASE OF PROBLEM IS VERY HECTIC. SPEND MONEY WERE THERE IS QUALITY AND SERVICE IN CASE OF DEFECTS. SPENDING HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN BUYING A SAMSUNG SMART PHONE IS TOTALLY A WASTE. ALERT GUYS."
Galaxy S Advance,1,"NO DOUBT SAMSUNG ARE PRODUCING GUD FONES. BUT THEY ARE STILL WAY FAR FROM NOKIA AS FAR AS SERVICE IS CONCERNED. NOW I UNDERSTOOD WHY NOKIA IS THE MOST TRUSTED MOBILE BRAND IN INDIA (IT'S NOT MY OPINION, IT'S A RESEARCH DONE BY SOME SURVEY). NOKIA'S SERVICE WAS SERIOUSLY GUD.
      
      
      HAD A WORST EXPERIENNCE WITH SAMSUNG MOBILE SERVICE."
Galaxy S Advance,1,"NO WORDS TO SAY. JUST RELEASED OPTIMUS L9 BEATS THIS IN MANY ASPECTS. JUST LOOK AT THE DESIGN OF L9.  GALAXY ADVANCE ... NO WHERE NEAR IT.
      
      INSTEAD OF WASTING A LOT IN MARKETING SAMSUNG TRY A BIT MORE TO GIVE BETTER DEVICE AT ""CHEAP"" PRICE."
Galaxy S Advance,1,"NOT WORTH FOR 24K, IT BEST BUY BETWEEN 17.5 TO 19.5K
      
      
      YES MEMORY AND CPU ARE BETTER BUT NOT WORTH FOR 24K TOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH"
Galaxy S Advance,1,"OBVIOUSLY SAMSUNG HAS GOT THE PRICING WRONG OR THE SPECS WRONG.
      
      SHOULD BE 20K OR 8MP CAMERA 1GB RAM, 1650MAH BATTERY.
      
      DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT.
      
      FOR CUSTOMERS WITH BUDGET 20K IT IS VERY CONFUSING TO CHOOSE A PHONE EITHER TO DECREASE THERE BUDGET FOR SINGLE CORE SMALLER SCREEN LESS SPECS PHONE OR INCREASE BUDGET AND GET HIGH END PHONE"
Galaxy S Advance,1,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. SAMSUNG IS SELLING FAULTY PHONE THEN REPAIRING IT. IT HAS BELOW PROBLEM

Galaxy S Duos,5,"GOOD PHONE AT THAT PRICE
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR A MONTH NOW AND FOLLOWING ARE THINGS WHICH YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE PHONE:-
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1) EXCELLENT BATTERY BACKUP (WITH MODERATE TO HEAVY USAGE, IT LASTS FOR ATLEAST 15 HOURS)
      
      2) SNAPPY INTERFACE. WORKS LIKE A CHARM. (I AM USING IT ALONG WITH A 8GB MEMORY CARD-CLASS 6)
      
      3) MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS WHICH A REGULAR ANDROID USER WOULD REQUIRE CAN BE USED ON THIS PHONE (WHATSAPP, GMAIL, GTALK, FACEBOOK, FLASHLIGHT, DROPBOX, INSTAGRAM, GOOGLE MAPS, CRICBUZZ, NEWSPAPER APPS, LINKEDIN, MARKET APPS, SOUNDHOUND, SWISS ARMY KNIFE, M-INDICATOR, FREE SMS INDIA AND MANY MORE)
      
      3) 3GB INTERNAL MEMORY. OUT OF WHICH YOU GET AROUND 1GB DEDICATED FOR INSTALLING APPS. YOU WILL RARELY RUN OUT OF MEMORY. (OTHER PHONES WITH LESS INTERNAL MEMORY KEEP ON DISPLAYING ANNOYING POP UP MESSAGES AND EVEN BLOCK BASIC CALLING/TEXTING FUNCTIONALITY IF INTERNAL MEMORY IS FULL)
      
      4) DECENT RAM (289MB) IS AMPLE ENOUGH FOR MODERATE MULTITASKING (LIKE MUSIC PLAYER+GOOGLE MAPS+MESSAGING/WHATSAPP)
      
      5) EXCELLENT FOR MESSAGING EVEN WITH BIG FINGERS (USING IN BUILT SWYPE FEATURE, TEXTING IS REALLY QUICK)
      
      6) MUSIC PLAYS DECENTLY IN THE HEADPHONES. NOT VERY LOUD ON THE SPEAKERS.
      
      7) CALL QUALITY IS FANTASTIC. LOUDSPEAKER DURING CALLS IS LOUD ENOUGH AND IMPRESSIVE
      
      8) VOICE TO TEXT FEATURE CAN BE USED FLAWLESSLY.
      
      9) GPS LOCKS YOUR POSITION WITHIN A MINUTE
      
      
      IN SHORT, IT HAS MOST OF THE ADVANTAGES OF A SAMSUNG PHONE. I'VE USED HIGHER END SAMSUNG PHONES INCLUDING GALAXY S2, GALAXY S PLUS, GALAXY S, ETC AND THE FUNCTIONALITY IS QUITE SIMILAR
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) DISPLAY SCREEN IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE. VIEWING ANGLES ARE RESTRICTED. COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
      
      2) CAMERA IS 2MP. NO FLASHLIGHT, NO AUTOFOCUS. POOR IMAGE QUALITY (THOUGH U CAN USE FLASHLIGHT APP AND USE UR SCREEN AS A TORCH)
      
      3) NO PROXIMITY SENSOR. BUT THE PHONE IS SMARTLY DESIGNED TO LOCK THE SCREEN AS SOON AS U MAKE A CALL. U HAVE TO DOUBLE TAP TO UNLOCK. THE BACKLIGHT GOES OFF WITHIN A FEW SECONDS WHILE ON CALL
      
      4) NOT UPGRADEABLE TO ANDROID 4.0 ICS. I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH NEED FOR THAT AS THE DEVICE RUNS SMOOTHLY ON THE CURRENT 2.3.6 ANDROID
      
      5) NOT ALL GAMES WORK. FOR EG: TEMPLE RUN DOES NOT WORK.
      
      
      OVERALL:
      
      I WOULD RATE IT 8/10 (2 POINTS DEDUCTED FOR THE DISPLAY &AMP; LACK OF AUTOFOCUS)
      
      THIS IS AN ULTRA LOW BUDGET ANDROID PHONE WHICH WILL FULFILL YOUR BASIC ANDROID NEEDS. NOTHING FANCY. NOT AT ALL A CAMERA PHONE.
      
      
      STURDY PHONE WHICH REALLY FITS IN YOUR POCKET &AMP; NOT TOO HARSH ON THE POCKET ;)
      
      EXCELLENT VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT!
      
      GOT THIS PHONE FOR AROUND RS 5700. THE PHONE HAS HARDLY ANY COMPETITORS IN THIS PRICE RANGE UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO COMPROMISE ON THE BRAND NAME.
      
      HURRY UP AS SAMSUNG HAS LAUNCHED THE DUOS VERSION OF THIS PHONE(WHICH IS PRICED HIGHER) AND HENCE IS DISCONTINUING THE SINGLE SIM MODEL."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"GOOD PHONE WITH FEATURES.
      
      PRICE POINT OF VIEW NO ONE BEATS THIS PHONE.
      
      YOU HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT USING  THIS PHONE TO AVOID HANGING ISSUE.
      
      AT FIRST MAY YOU NOT LIKE THIS PHONE BUT AFTER LEARN YOU DEFINITELY LOVE THIS PHONE.
      
      LOOKS IS AWESOME.
      
      LITTLE BIT SLOW.BUT YOU HAVE TO ARRANGE THIS FROM PRICE POINT OF VIEW.
      
      WHO GIVES BAD REVIEWS SUGGESTED THEM TO BUY S3,S4
      
      USE APP KILLER APPS FOR GOOD BATTERY BACKUP AND SPEED."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"GREAT PRODUCT AND FULL PACK OF FEATURES OF THIS PRICE, MUSIC QUALITY CAMERA AND DISPLAY ARE THE BEST POINTS AND IT IS ALSO RUNNING ALL POPULAR GAMES I M USING TEMPLE RUN 1 &AMP; 2, FRONT LINE COMMANDO,RAGING THUNDER, BLOOD AND GLOORY,DEAD TRIGGER, AGENT DASH AND SUBWAY SURFER ALL THESE GAMES ARE RUNING VERY NICE THERE IS NO LAG IN GAMES."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"GUYS DONT BE FOOLED BY SEEING THE WRONG REVIEWS POSTED BY NON CERTIFIED BUYERS S DUOS IS A BEST MID RANGE SMARTPHONE IN 12K RANGE.IT HAS GREAT FEATURES LIKE DUAL SIM ANDROID 4.0 BUT UPDATE OF JELLY BEAN IS AVALIABLE.IT HAS WVGA RESOLUTION BUT ITS PIXEL DENSSITY IS 233PPI FAR BETTER THAN GRAND.BUT IT HAS ONLY 1GHZ SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR GETS A CLOCK SPEED OF 850 MHZ BEST IN THIS ASPECT.S3 LOOK OF THIS MOBILE IS GREAT.

      1 SMART DUAL SIM(2SIM ACTIVE)
      
      2 S3 LOOK
      
      3 ANDROID 4.0 (OFFICIAL JELLY BEAN UPDATE)

      6 5MP WITH XENON FLASH
      
      7 768 MB RAM (GREAT MULTI TASKING)
      
      CONS:
      
      1 1GHZ SINGLE CORE (IT CAN RUN SMOOTHLY HEAVY GAMES TEMPLE RU,SUBWAY SURFERS SMOOTHLY)
      
      2 NOT AMOLED (BUT WVGA WITH 233PPI IS VERY GOOD)
      
      3 NO HD VIDEO PLAY BACK (CAN PLAY 640*480 WHICH IS AROUND 40 MB,CANNOT PLAY 1080P WHICH IS AROUND 100 MB)
      
      SO FINALLY IT GOT ALL PERFECT FEATURES THXAT A MID RANGE SMARTPHONE SHOULD HAVE.SO DONT GO FOR ANY BLIND REVIEWS."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"GUYS, I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR THREE MONTHS NOW AND ITS REALLY A VERY GOOD PHONE. ITS SCREEN, CAMERA AND FEATURES ARE GOOD AT ITS PRICE RANGE. I DON'T THINK ONE CAN ASK MORE FROM THIS PHONE. BUT THE ONLY DOWNSIDE ON THIS PHONE IS THAT THE PROCESSING SPEED IS NOT THAT GOOD. BUT IT SHOULD STILL BE VERY USEFUL FOR BUSINESS. DEFINITELY NOT A PHONE FOR GAMERS. THE RAM SHOWN IS 768 BUT ONLY 645 IS AVAILABLE. BUT OVERALL I LIKE THIS PHONE. ITS A GOOD ONE AND YOU CAN BUY IT."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"HAVING USED XPERIA ARC SINCE IT WAS LAUNCHED, IT WAS A DIFFICULT CHOICE FOR ANOTHER ANDROID PHONE OTHER THAN XPERIA, BUT AT A PRICE POINT OF 12,800 GALAXY S DUOS WAS THE BEST CHOICE I MADE. AFTER USING THIS PHONE FOR AROUND 1 MONTH I AM SATISFIED WITH IT. DEFINATELY THE BEST ALL ROUNDER PHONE AT THIS PRICE POINT..........."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"HELLO ALL!
      
      I HAVE GONE THRU ALL THE REVIEWS ON THIS PHONE ON FLIPKART AND ALMOST ALL REVIEWS ON THE NET. I HAVE FEW QUESTIONS TO ASK THE USERS.
      
      1. WHAT IS THE NEED FOR A PHONE? -COMMUNICATION..?? OR JUST ARGUMENT ON NET?
      
      2. WHO IS A USER? - NORMAL HUMAN BEING -- GEEKS DON'T READ THIS REVIEW. I DON'T HAVE SO MUCH BRAINS.
      
      3. WHAT WUD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN S, S2 AND S3 FOR A NORMAL USER, APART FROM SIZE, CAMERA AND COST??? --- NOTHING!!
      
      
      REVIEW-
      
      PHONE IS NEEDED FOR COMMUNICATION. UNTIL NOW, I HAD A SAMSUNG HERO (1900 RS) WHICH I'M USING EVEN NOW. I'LL NOT DISCARD IT. IT CAN DO EVERYTHING WHAT A GALAXY PHONE CAN DO.
      
      
      GALAXY S DUOS IS A NICE PHONE. WORTH EVERY PENNY. ITS STYLISH, AND WILL MAKE ALL THE EYES TURN TOWARDS YOU. LARGE SCREEN, SIMPLE ICS INTERFACE (ITS THE SAME EVEN IF U BUY A 40K PHONE!) WELL SOUNDING SPEAKERS, NICE CAMERA AND DUAL SIM FUNCTIONALITY.
      
      I CAN PLAY ANGRY BIRDS AND TEMPLE RUN. MOST OF MY FRENDS WHO HAVE TOP CLASS PHONES (LIKE THE OTHER USERS WHO HAVE SCOLDED THIS PHONE) WITH 1.5 GHZ + PROCESSORS, STILL PLAY THE SAME GAMES! SAAAD..!! WELL I'M PLAYING THE SAME FOR 10K TO 15K LESS!
      
      
      VERDICT:
      
      FOR AN NORMAL HUMAN USER THIS IS A SIMPLY SUPERB PHONE! I DUNNO Y ITS NOT SUPERB FOR OTHERS, THEY SHUD ANSWER :P"

Galaxy S Duos,5,HEY GAYS  U SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT ADVANCE COMES WITH ANDROID VERSION 2.1 OUT OF BOX BUT SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS COMES WITH 4.1 ANDROID VERSION OUT OF BOX ....... AND BY THE WAY IT IS A PHONE NOT A TABLET THAT U WANT IT TO HAVE ABOVE 1 GZ PROCESSOR . SO IF U WANT TO BYE A SMART DUAL SIM MOBILE THAN IT IS THE BEST .....   !!!   :) :)
Galaxy S Duos,5,"HEY GUYS, THIS ONE IS CERTAINLY A GOOD ONE.
      
      IT LACKS IN SOME FEATURES LIKE NO GORILLA GLASS, SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR, NO HD RECORDING, BUT RUNS APPS BETTER THAN ANY MICROMAX OR KARBONN PHONE, IN WHICH YOU GET A VERY BASIC STOCK OS AND ALSO THERE IS ONLY 512 MB RAM.. SAMSUNG'S UI IS DEFINETELY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER UI.
      
      BY THE WAY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GOT A FIVE FINGER MULTITOUCH IN OTHER KARBONN OR MMX PHONES
      
      IN SOME REVIEWS, IT IS WRITTEN THAT IT HAS 512 MB RAM, NO, IT IS 768 MB...,OPEN YOUR EYES.
      
      IF YOU WANT A DUAL SIM FROM A RELIABLE COMPANY, THIS IS IT.
      
      AND DONT GET LURED TOWARDS SOME OF THE NEW KARBONN OR MMX PHONES WHICH GIVE QUADCORE PROCESSORS AND OTHER ATTRACTIVE FEATURES BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EFFICIENT ENOUGH.."

      THE  PHONE IS  REALLY  AWSM  , WHEN YOU READ THE REVIEWS  DON'T  GET CONFUSED   JUST IGNORE THEM INCLUDING MINE .
      
      
      BUY THE PHONE  AND FELL IT"
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I AM GIVING THIS REVIEW AFTER 2 DAYS OF BUY FROM A NEAR BY SMART PHONE CAFE
      
      
      NO ISSUES REGARDING MUSIC OR VIDEO THEY ARE AS USUAL AS NORMAL PHONE
      
      
      NOW TO ITS OS,UI-THEY ARE OK I FOUND NO LAGGING WHILE MULTIPLE APPS R RUNNING
      
      
      DESIGN-AS WE KNOW GALAXY S3 LOOKS I HAVE BOUGHT BLACK ONE IT LOOKS COOL WITH GALAXY S3  WALLPAPER IT LOOKS MORE KOOL
      
      
      NOW TO GAMING AND GRAPHICS -I WILL SAY ITS GRAPHICS IS BEST WITHIN THIS RANGE I DOWNLOADED AND PLAYED THESE GAMES-TALKING TOM,TALKING TOM 2,SPEED NIGHT 2,3D DRAG RACE,ANGRY BIRDS SPACE,TEMPLE RUN OZ,NFS SHIFT,ASSIAN CREED AND FIFA 12 THEY RUN LIKE A SMOOTH BUTTER I LIKED ITS GAMING MOST
      
      
      AND LASTLY TO CAMERA-I FELT THAT IT DOES THE BEST AND I ALSO VIDEOCHATED WID MY UNCLE IN THIS PHONE HE SAID ITS FRONTCAM HAVE BETTER CLARITY THAN OUR COMPUTERS I BECOME VERY HAPPY
      
      
      BUT I FOUND ITS ONLY PROBLEM IS BATTRY LIFE WHICH LAST ABOUT 15-20 HRS OF AVERAGE USE(FOR ME AVERAGE IS ONLY LISTENING MUSIC AS I AM A MUSIC LOVER) AND ITS STAND BY IS PREETY WELL ABOUT 1-2 DAYS AND THE MOST BIGGEST PROBLEM IS HEATING PROBLEM WHEN I AM USING INTERNET AND LISTENING MUSIC OR WHILE PLAYING GAMES IT HEATS UP TOO MUCH IN JUST 5 HRS SO I PREFER TO USE ONLY 1 THING AT A TIME
      
      
      I WILL GIVE THIS PHONE 4.5 RATING FOR ITS FANTASTIC FEATURES"
Galaxy S Duos,5,I AM USING THIS FOR LAST 1 WEEK. LOOK WISE ITS AWESOME. GOOD TOUCHSCREEN. GOOD BATTERY. I LOVE IT. ITS LIKE ALL THE WORLD IN MY HAND. SCREEN SIZE JUST PERFECT FOR MY PALM. HAVE TOO SEE HOW IT PERFORM WITH 16G SD CARD. YET TO RECEIVE IT FROM SAMSUNG.
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR THREE WEEKS NOW. I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS WORTH TO BUY UNDER 15K.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      DUAL SIM
      
      GOOD DISPLAY
      
      4 INCH SCREEN
      
      RESPONSIVE TOUCH

      CONS:
      
      BATTERY LAST ONLY A DAY OF AVERAGE USAGE (BUT THAT IS COMMON FOR ALL ANDROID PHONES)
      
      SLIGHTLY LESS SPEAKER VOLUME DURING CALL
      
      
      COMMENTS:
      
      MANY USERS HAVE COMMENTED THAT THE PROCESSOR IS VERY SLOW. I FOUND THAT AFTER DISABLING THE POWER SAVER OPTION THE GAMING EXPERIENCE IS SMOOTH. TEMPLE RUN 2 RUNS SMOOTHLY AFTER DISABLING POWER SAVING (AS IT STOPS TO LIMIT PROCESSOR SPEED).
      
      
      SOME USERS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THE MUSIC BREAKS DURING PLAY.
      
      I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE FIRMWARE HAS BEEN UPDATED AND A NEW MUSIC PLAYER (GOOGLE MUSIC PLAYER) HAS BEEN INSTALLED WHICH WORKS QUITE WELL AND IS SMALL IN SIZE.
      
      ALSO TTPOD WORKS WELL WITH THE DEVICE.
      
      
      OVER ALL I AM QUITE HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE. AFTER ALL I HAVE SPENT ONLY 14300 ON THIS PHONE AND I CAN NOT EXPECT A PERFORMANCE LIKE GALAXY S3 OR NOTE 2.
      
      
      BUT STILL IT RUNS GAMES QUITE WELL, DISPLAY AND CAMERA ARE QUITE GOOD. IT IS DUAL SIM WHICH IS THE BEST ADVANTAGE.

Galaxy S Duos,5,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE FOR MY BROTHER, HIS MAIN PREFERENCE IS DUAL SIM, AFTER READING SOME REVIEWS AND FEEDBACK FROM MY FRIENDS WHO ARE USING THIS MOBILE, I WENT WITH THIS, THINK I MADE A WISE DECISION AND MY BROTHER JUST LOVE THIS PHONE.
      
      
      AS USUAL FLIPKART ROCKS WITH THEIR RAPID FAST DELIVERY AND PACKING."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM A LOCAL SAMSUNG DEALER AND GOT IT FOR 14000 RUPEES.
      
      
      MY VIEWS ON PHONE AFTER WEEK OF USE..
      
      
      LOOKS
      
      PHONE LOOKS GOOD.. IT HAS PLASTIC BODY BUT DOESNT FEEL CHEAP AT AT ALL
      
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY AROUND 1.78 GB
      
      WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
      
      
      RAM
      
      IT HAS 646 MB OF RAM AND AFTER INSTALLING ALL THE NECESSARY APPS
      
      AROUND 200 MB IS FREE (WHICH IS FINE)
      
      
      PROCESSOR
      
      IT HAS 1GHZ CORTEX A5 PROCESSOR AND
      
      SAMSUNG HAS OPTIMIZED ICS AND THERE NATURE UI TO RUN SMOOTHLY ON THIS PHONE.
      
      BUT OCCASIONALLY I FOUND SOME LAGS..
      
      
      BATTERY BACK UP
      
      RIGHT NOW I AM USING IT WITH SINGLE SIM ON 3G AND IT LASTING MORE THAN DAY
      
      
      PROBLEMS
      
      WHILE PLAYING MUSIC THERE IS LAG
      
      U HAVE TO KILL ALL THE APPS FOR SMOOTH EXPERIENCE
      
      
      APART FROM THIS I DIDNT FOUND ANY ISSUE WITH THE PHONE
      
      
      ""IT DOES WHAT IT MEANT FOR ""
      
      SUPPORT DUAL SIM"
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE, EVEN AFTER I READ SO MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS. NOT FROM FLIPKART THOUGH. AND YES IT DOES HANG A LOT. I GOT FRUSTRATED WITHIN THE FIRST DAY ITSELF. BUT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS FOR THIS.
      
      
      THE BLOATWARE INSTALLED BY SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE TAKES A LOT OF THE PHONES MEMORY. I WENT AHEAD AND ROOTED IT. REMOVED ALL THE PRE INSTALLED APPS AND BLOATWARE. AND TEH PHONE IS SUPER FAST UNLINKE ANYOTHER PHONE I HAVE USED UNTILL NOW. SURE, IT VOIDS WARRANTY. BUT I DIDNT WANT TO SPEND HALF OF MY TIME JUST RESTARTING THE PHONE. I AM PRETTY HAPPY WITH THE PHONE NOW. CHEERS"
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I COULD USE IT ONLY FOR 1AND 1/2 MONTHS BCZ IT'S BEING PIC POCKETED.BUT I ASSURE ALL OF U...YOUR MONEY WONT EVER GET WASTE IF U HAVE THIS PHONE.
      
      
      1.NO TECHNICAL GLITCH..TOUCH IS AWESOME.
      
      
      2.APPLICATION RUNS SO LUCIDLY AND SMOOTHLY UNLESS  YOU BROWSE MULTIPLE APPLICATION.
      
      
      3. WIFI APPLICATION AND OTHER NAVIGATION IS BRILLIANT.WATCHING VIDEOS WITH 4"" SCREEN IS AMAZING.
      
      
      4.PICTURE QUALITY ON DAYLIGHT IS BRILLIANT BUT NITE SHOTS MAY DISAPPOINT U A BIT.IF U MAKE CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS U CAN GET OVER IT.
      
      
      5.LISTENING MUSIC IS SO SOOTHING THROUGH EARPHONE,PERFECT MIX OF SOUND AND BASS,IT'LL SURELY MESMERIZE U.
      
      
      6.YA DIALING THROUGH PHONE CALL BY DUAL SIM MEANS TO JUGGLE THROUGH SIM IS A PROBLEM.
      
      
      7.AFTER ALL PRICE IS COMPETITIVE.SAMSUNG STORE GIVE YOU THIS MOBILE AT THE SAME PRICE(14900)WITH NO INTEREST AND PROCESSING FEE ON EMI OVER 6 MONTHS PERIOD."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I GOT THIS MOBILE A MONTH BACK.  OUT OF ANXIETY, I SYNCED ALL THE EMAILS, MESSENGERS, ETC ETC ETC WHEN I CONNECTED TO MY WI-FI.  I GOT STUCK AND THE PHONE DID NOT RESPOND FOR ALMOST 3 TO 5 MINUTES.  I THOUGHT, I HAD MADE A BAD DECISION IN BUYING THIS MOBILE.  I THOUGHT VERY SERIOUSLY, HOW TO SORT OUT THIS ISSUE.  MAY BE THE RAM IS LESS AND HENCE, THIS PROB ARISES.  HENCE, I DECIDED TO DE-SYNC THE EMAILS ETC.  JUST USE ONE AT A TIME, WHENEVER NEEDED, THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED.  IT NEVER CREATED PROBLEM AFTER THAT AND IT IS RUNNING SO SMOOTH WITHOUT ANY HASSLES.  THE CONCEPT IS VERY SIMPLE.  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A 3-PHASE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY FOR YOUR HOUSE AND YOU SWITCH ON YOUR WATER HEATER, WASHING MACHINE, AC ETC ALL AT A TIME, WHAT WILL HAPPEN??  THE SAME HAPPENED HERE.  IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH ON EVERYTHING AT A TIME, THEN YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SHED OUT MONEY FOR GETTING POWER WHICH GIVES YOU THAT MUCH CAPACITY.
      
      
      THIS MOBILE IS WONDERFUL, NEVER LAGS FOR MY TEMPLE RUN GAME, AND DON'T FORGET THERE IS ALWAYS A LIMITATION WORTH IT.  FOR THIS PRICE, THE MOBILE IS LOVELY ONE COMPARED TO OTHERS"
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I GOT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART 8 MONTHS BACK.I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE LAST 8 MONTHS.STILL DIDN'T FIND ANY FLAWS WITH THIS PHONE.PERFORMANCE WISE IT IS GOOD.FEATURES ARE DECENT AS EXPECTED UNDER 10K.NOW THE PRICE HAS ALREADY BEEN SLASHED.I GOT THIS ON 8,500.THE PRICE HAS SURPRISINGLY SLASHED."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS CELL(NOT BOUGHT FROM FLIPKART THOUGH).
      
      I HAVE NOT FACED ANY PROBLEMS ON THIS DEVICE.
      
      MY SUGGESTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING BAD REVIEWS ABOUT THIS DEVICE: ANY PHONE WILL LAG IF NOT USED SENSIBLY."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I HAVE PLACED THE ORDER FOR THE PHONE AND AS MENTIONED IN THE STOCK ITEM THAT THIS WILL DELIVER WITHIN 6-8 DAYS (I ORDERED ON 12TH MAR AND WAS EXPECTING AROUND 19TH MAR). BUT TO MY PLEASANT SURPRISE IT ARRIVES IN 3RD DAY (14TH MAR). ONCE AGAIN GREAT SERVICE BY FLIPKART. THE PHONE IS GREAT WITH FEATURES IN THE PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      FOR THE USERS WHO WANTS SOME GOOD GAMING EXPERIENCE BUT NOT FOR EXTREME GAME LOVERS AND CAN LEVERAGE THE DUAL SIM FUNCTIONALITY. THE LOOKS IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO S3.
      
      
      THE 768 MB RAM IS SUFFICIENT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO DOES NOT GOES FOR EXTREME GAMING.
      
      INTERNAL 4GB IS GOOD FOR STORING THE DATA AND I GOT THE PHONE WITH 8GB MICROSD AND THIS MUCH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR STORING SONGS OR HEAVIER DATA.
      
      
      THE ATITUDE FLIP COVER FOR THIS PHONE IS ALSO LOOKS GOOD.
      
      
      OVERALL I AM A HAPPY BUYER.
      
      
      THANKS TO FLIPKART."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I REALLY ENJOY SHOPPING WITH FLIPKART.  THE DELIVERY WAS PROMPT.  THE OFFERS ARE REDEEMED WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY.  AMONG ALL THE SHOPPING SITES THE SATISFACTION LEVEL WITH FLIPKART IS 100%.
      
      ABOUT THE PRODUCT 7502, EVERYTHING IS EXCELLENT EXCEPT I FEEL THE WIFI CONNECTIVITY IS NOT GOOD.  I HAVE SAMSUNG GALAXY YOUNG S5630 ALSO.  COMPARITIVELY IT PICKUPS WIFI SIGNALS VERY WELL."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"I WANTED TO BUY A PHONE WITHIN 15K SO I HAD BEEN READING, SURFING SEARCHING AND COMPARING ALL THE PHONES WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN 10K TO 18K.
      
      I HAVE COMPARED SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS WITH PHONES LIKE:
      
      SONY XPERIA SOLA: RS 14500 APPROX
      
      SONY XPERIA U: 13200 APPROX
      
      SONY XPERIA J: 16700 APPROX
      
      HTC DESIRE V: &GT;16000 APPROX
      
      HTC ONE V: &GT; 16000 APPROX
      
      SONY XPERIA RAY 17900
      
      SONY XPERIA NEO V 17900
      
      SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS: 14900
      
      APART FROM PRICE THE DIFFERENCES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
      
      AMONG ALL OF THE ABOVE PHONE ONLY SAMSUNG HAS THE HIGHEST RAM.
      
      MOST OF THEM DOESN'T PROVIDE FRONT CAMERA HENCE ARE FEATURE DEFICIENT.
      
      IT HAS BETTER BLUETOOTH I.E. BLUETOOTH 3.0.
      
      
      NOW AFTER I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE I WILL SHARE YOU MY PERSONAL EXP WITH THIS PHONE:
      
      1. DISPLAY IS AWESOME.
      
      2. TOUCH IS AS SMOOTH AS SILK.
      
      3. YOU CAN PLAY TEMPLE RUN WITHOUT ANY LAG AT ALL WHICH NONE OF THE XPERIA PHONE PRICED BELOW 18K CAN DO. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE MOST OF MY FRIENDS HAVE XPERIA PHONES AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IN THE REVIEW COMMENTS OF XPERIA PHONES.
      
      4. YOU CAN RUN FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP, TEMPLE RUN, JETPACK JOYRIDE TOGETHER WITH ALL THE APPS STAYING AND RUNNING HAPPILY IN THE RAM. OTHER PHONES WILL DIE HANDLING ALL THESE TOGETHER.
      
      5. PEOPLE COMPLAINT THAT IT IS SO SLOW THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN OPEN THE CONTACTS. I HAVE SYNCED ALL THE FB CONTACTS AND I HAVE A TOTAL OF 600 CONTACTS AND IT GETS OPEN AS SOON AS YOU PRESS THE CONTACT ICON.
      
      6. CAMERA QUALITY IS AWESOME AS IT HAS BEEN WITH GALAXY SERIES RIGHT FROM THE BEGINING. NO ONE CAN CHALLENGE THAT.
      
      7. LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST THIS IS A DUAL SIM PHONE SO AN ADDED ADVANTAGE.
      
      
      ***GO FOR THIS HANDSET.*** PLEASE DON'T BOTHER ABOUT THE REVIEWS POSTED BELOW THIS BECAUSE THOSE REVIEWS REALLY DISCOURAGED ME AND THOSE ALL ARE BASELESS. THIS IS A GREAT PHONE."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"IF YOU ARE GETTING CONFUSED WITH RECENT NEGATIVE COMMENTS, JUST THINK AGAIN IN 12990/- YOU ARE GETTING A PHONE WITH ALL THE FEATURES YOU NEED PLUS BEAUTIFUL BLUETOOTH HEADSET FROM SAMSUNG.
      
      IN 12990/- YOU WON'T GET A BETTER DEAL BUDDY.
      
      PROS:
      
      1. DESCENT RAM
      
      2. PRETTY GOOD PROCESSOR 1 GHZ
      
      3. 4GB INTERNAL MEMORY (1.57 GB USER ACCESSIBLE)
      
      4. QUALITY CAMERA OF 5 MP
      
      5. SECONDARY CAMERA 0.3 MP (MANY XPERIA PHONE DOES NT PROVIDE)
      
      6. GOOD BATTERY
      
      7. PRE-INSTALLED APPS FROM SAMSUNG
      
      8. 4 INCH GORGEOUS SCREEN AND FITS WELL IN UR POCKET
      
      9. DON'T FORGET THE JELLY BEAN OS.
      
      10. BEAUTIFUL INTERFACE
      
      
      CONS:
      
      ONLY THOSE PEOPLE WILL FIND CONS IN THIS PHONE WHO ARE GAMING FREAK OR WHO USE THIS PHONE BEYOND ITS CAPACITY. SIMPLEST EXAMPLE IS IF YOU HAVE USED GALAXY NOTE HOW CAN YOU LIKE A 13K PHONE.
      
      
      OVERALL VERDICT: BEST INVESTMENT OF MONEY. BEST 13K PHONE IN MARKET AND DNT FORGET THE TAG OF SAMSUNG.
      
      GO FOR IT GUYS :)"
Galaxy S Duos,5,"IT IS YOU CAN SAY THE COMMON MAN'S PHONE ITS STYLISH AS WELL AS POWERFULL EVEN AN APPLE IPHONE 4S DOES NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH AND SD CARD SLOT WHILE THIS BEAST HAS
      
      
      IF SOMEONE SAYS S ADVANCE IS BETTER TELL THEM ""OPEN YOUR EYES STUPID S ADVANCE USES ANDROID 2.2 WHILE S DUOS USES  4.0 ICS"" FOR RAM S ADVANCE USES DDR1 WHILE SDUOS USES DDR2

      ONLY SAD BECAUSE I CANT PLAY 1080 P :-P JUST REMOVING THAT  ITS A GR8 PHONE. I LIKE IT"
Galaxy S Duos,5,"NOWADAYS, SAMSUNG COMING UP WITH A NEW MODEL EVERY ANOTHER DAY, SO IT'S HARD TO CHOSE ONE WHICH CAN BE THE BEST BUY. BACK IN SEPT 12 WHEN THIS MODEL WAS RELEASED IT WAS A BOOM IN DUAL SIM ANDROID MARKET AS IT WAS THE ONLY DECENT SPEC DUAL SIM ANDROID WITH 480X800 SCREEN RESOLUTION, FRONT CAM AND ANDROID ICS, BUT NOW THERE ARE MANY TO CHOOSE FROM.
      
      DURING INITIAL DAYS THIS PHONE USED TO SELL IN RETAIL MARKET FOR RS 17K OR SO, WHICH WASN'T A GOOD BUY FOR THIS LOW SPECS. SO I HOLD MY GUNS AND WAITED FOR FEW MONTHS FOR THE PRICE TO SETTLE DOWN.
      
      NOW ITS AVAILABLE FOR RS 11K WHICH IS SOMEWHAT DECENT PRICE FOR THIS PHONE AS IT HAS EVERYTHING THAT ONE NEEDS ON DAY TO DAY BASIS.
      
      OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE LOT OF REVIEWS STATING THAT THE PHONE IS SLOW, BLA BLA BLA BUT THE FACT IS WHEN YOU BUY A DEVICE OF THIS SPEC AND THIS RANGE, YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT KIND OF PERFORMANCE YOU ARE GONNA GET FROM IT. YOU CAN'T JUST DREAM OF GETTING THE PERFORMANCE OF GALAXY S3 WITH THIS ONE. SO SENSIBLE USERS WON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS PHONE.
      
      SO OVERALL A VERY GOOD PHONE AT BUDGET PRICE OF RS 11K, BUT IDEALLY THE RATE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO RS 10K TO MAKE IT A MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE DEAL, THANKS."

Galaxy S Duos,5,"SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS S7562 (PURE WHITE), GOT IT FOR RS 14,999.. ALONG WITH 16GB CARD AND HEADSET, SO LITERALLY I GOT THE PHONE FOR RS.14000. PHONE IS JUST BEST ON DEMAND. YOU CANNOT EXPECT ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS FOR THIS PRICE RANGE. FLIPKART SERVICE ALSO WAS GOOD. GOT DELIVERED IN 3 DAYS FROM ORDER AND 1 DAY SHIPMENT. HI5 WITH FLIPKART N SAMSUNG.
      
      ONLY DRAWBACK IS U CANNOT MOVE THE APPS TO EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD. WHICH IS THE HUGE DRAWBACK IN THIS HANDSET. HOWEVER U CAN TRY INSTALLING APPS FOR THIS DEVICE TO MAKE  IT POSSIBLE.
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY SPEC IS 4GB.. BUT U GET JUST 1.7GB FOR USAGE.
      
      RAM 768 MB ACCORDING ON PAPER.. BUT U GET JUST 650MB FOR USAGE.
      
      REST ALL ARE HI5..

IT WORKS PERFECTLY FINE AS I NEED MY ANDROID PHONE TO WORK. I DO NOT PLAY GAMES SO NOT SURE OF THE GAMING PART. BUT REST ASSURED IT IS A QUALITY PRODUCT AND ADVICE ALL TO ONLY GO  FOR QUALITY AND BRANDS THAT ARE KNOWN AND USED WORLD WIDE. YOU WILL SURELY REGRET PURCHASING ANY UNKNOWN BRAND NAMES TO THE WORLD.

Galaxy S Duos,5,"THIS IS AN AWESOME PHONE WHICH NO OTHER CAN BEAT IN THIS PRICE RANGE..!!!
      
      
      MAIN HIGHLIGHT IS DUAL SIM AND THE 768MB RAM(WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR SMOOTH INTERNET BROWSING AND WHEN MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS ARE LOADED). I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER MOBILES IN THIS RANGE OR 4K ABOVE THIS MOBILE WITH SO MUCH RAM AND FEATURES. I JUST LOVE THIS PHONE..AND SPECIAL THANKS TO FLIPKART'S SUPER SPEED DELIVERY AS ALWAYS."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"THIS IS ONE OF THE GOOD PRODUCT  I HAVE EVER SEEN IN COMPARISON TO OTHERS MOBILE,DURING ON NET SEARCH I FOUND MYDEALS247 AS ON F THE BEST SITE TO GET IT....................REALLY BELIEVE ME IT IS ON OF THE BEST SITE TO GET IT.................................................."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"THIS IS THE BEST ANDROID MOBILE IN THIS PRICE RANGE. I AM USING IT FOR LAST 4 DAYS. IT PERFORMANCE IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. THOSE ARE SAYING THIS NOT GOOD THEY ACTUALLY DO NOT KNOW, HOW TO OPERATE ANDROID SMART PHONES. THERE ARE NO SUCH PROBLEMS WITH CALLING AND CALL RECEIVING WITH ANY SIM. EVERYTHING CAN BE CONFIGURED IN THE SETTINGS."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"THIS IS VERY FABULOUS PRODUCT FROM SAMSUNG...
      
      REASONABLE PRICE FROM FLIPKART... AND FAST DELIVERY...
      
      USER USABLE MEMORY IS ONLY 1.69 GB...
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD... FRONT CAM IS NOT UPTO THE MARK...
      
      SOUND CLARITY IS OK... BUT NOT MUCH EXPECTED...."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"THIS MOBILE IS BEST IN IT'S CLASS. PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLAINING SHOULD FIRST KNOW WHAT A SMARTPHONE IS.
      
      1. PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT 1 SEC BLANK SCREEN AFTER SELECTING MESSAGE/PHONE:  IT IS DUE TO CACHING OF PROCESSES. YOU WILL GET THIS BEHAVIOUR EVEN IN S3 OR S4. THIS IS HOW ANY SMARTPHONE WORKS.
      
      
      2. PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT BATTERY BACKUP: YOU WILL NOT GET BATTERY BACKUP OF MORE THAN 1 DAY IN ANY SMARTPHONE. IF YOU NEED BATTERY BACKUP OF 1 MONTH THEN BETTER KEEP A FEATURE PHONE OF 800 INR.
      
      
      3. COMPLAINS ABOUT GAMING: HAVE YOU INSTALLED YOUR GAMNES ONLY BECAUSE YOULD HAVE WRITTEN YOUR REVIEWS ? IF YOU ARE A VERY GOOD GAMER THEN WHY DON'T YOU BUY APPLE 5/HTC ONE ???
      
      WHY DO YOU EXPECT SILLY/IMPOSSIBLE THINGS ?
      
      
      4. COMPLAINS OF HANG/RESTART PHONE: FIRST LEARN HOW TO USE A SMARTPHONE.
      
      
      5. HD VIDEO PLAY: WHY ONLY HD VIDEO, YOU SHOULD HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT LOT OF THINGS. E.G.
      
      THIS PHONE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FLY.
      
      THIS PHONE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM.
      
      THIS PHONE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PUSH THE TRIGGER OF A GUN AND SHOOT YOU ...........
      
      
      IF YOU HAVE SO MUCH DEMANDS THEN SPEND SOME MONEY AND THEN EXPECT THESE THINGS."
Galaxy S Duos,5,"THIS PHONE IS AMAZING.....
      
      AS FOR PLAYING GAMES,SOCIAL NETWORKING,VIDEO CHATTING AND THE CAMERA IS AWESOME........
      
      I AM USING THIS PHONE SINCE 4 MONTHS AND NOT A SINGLE TIME ITS HANGED.........VERY HAPPY WITH ITS PERFORMANCE........."

Galaxy S Duos,5,WITH ALL HEAVY SPECIFICATION IT'S PRICE DROPPED FROMM 17 K TO 13 K. NOW IT IS MORE AFFORDABLE THAN PAST. TRY IT WITH NO HESITATION &AMP; GET A BETTER RESULT FROM NEGETIVE REVIEWS.FLIPKART DOING A GREAT JOB WITH THE PRODUCT AND THEIR PRICE.
Galaxy S Duos,5,"WONDERFUL PRODUCT FOR MY USAGE. WAS A PROMPT DELIVERY BY FLIPKART. I TALK A LOT, USE GAMES AND NET A BIT AND STILL THE CHARGE COMES TO AROUND A COUPLE OF DAYS.

Galaxy S Duos,4,"1ST POINT WORTH NOTING IS THAT THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS ONLY 2GB, BUT STILL ENOUGH FOR THE APPS U NEED. INTERFACE IS SMOOTH. COLORS ARE BRILLIANT. IT'S USER FRIENDLY AND THE 4 INCH SCREEN IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE TO HOLD IN YOUR PALM. OVERALL IT CANT GET BETTER THAN THIS AT 13K."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"A MONTH BACK, I GOT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART, GREAT SERVICE FROM FLIPKART. I AM SHARING MY EXPERIENCE WITH GALAXY S DUOS 7562.....

Galaxy S Duos,4,"A VERY GOOD SMART ANDROID PHONE AT RS 13000. PLEASE  DONT EXPECT  S3 OR S2 FEATURES WITH JUST RS 13000. PHONE IS SLOW WITH TOO MUCH SLOW IF LOT OF APPLICATIONS INSTALLED, ITS RAM IS JUST 750, ON USE ITS SHOWING 500 RAM"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"A VERY NICE ICS WITH 1 GHZ 512 RAM AND LET ME TELL YOU THE CAMERA QUALITY IS WAY BETTER
      
      SECONDARY CAMERA IS GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE VIDEO CALLS
      
      A REALLY NICE PHONE LOOKING AT COST OF IT
      
      BATTERY LIFE A WAY TOO GOOD COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES IN SAME RANGE
      
      M USING THIS PHONE"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"AFTER READING SO MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, I STILL ORDERED IT AND WHEN I FINALLY RECEIVED IT, I WAS MORE THAN HAPPY WITH WHAT I GOT. GUYS, PLEASE DON'T EXPECT A S3 LIKE PERFORMANCE FOR 13K. THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR. BUT THIS DEVICE IS BRILLIANT IN ITSELF.
      
      
      ITS TRUE THAT IT IS SLOW. SO MANY FEATURES PUT PRESSURE ON THE 1GHZ PROCESSOR. HOWEVER I FIND THAT ITS NOT AS SLOW AS DESCRIBED IN OTHER REVIEWS. MOREOVER, AFTER UPGRADING THE OS TO JELLY BEAN, THE SPEED INCREASES. THE MINUTE LAGS ARE MANAGEABLE AND NOT AT ALL IRRITATING.
      
      
      INSTEAD LOOK FOR WHAT ALL FEATURES YOU GET FOR SUCH A PRICE! THE SCREEN/DISPLAY IS FABULOUS, SUCH BRIGHT AND VIVID WITH A GREAT PIXEL DENSITY. THE DISPLAY REALLY LOOKS SPECTACULAR AND IS BETTER THAN MANY OTHER PHONES OF THIS RANGE.
      
      
      BUTTERY SMOOTH TOUCHSCREEN.
      
      
      DESIGN IS ALSO PERFECT AND BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE, ITS REALLY GOOD TO HOLD AND OPERATE.
      
      
      I HAD A SAMSUNG GALAXY Y PRO DUOS BEFORE THIS DEVICE AND I AM REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS DEVICE. SO IF YOUR BUDGET IS BOUT 15K AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DUAL SIM PHONE, GO FOR THIS ONE. NO SECOND THOUGHTS."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"ALL TOGETHER IT IS EXCELLENT PHONE. VIDEO CALLING IS VERY GOOD. NICE OUT LOOK. LAVISH BUILT. AND GOOD MID RANGE ANDRIOD PHONE WITH DUAL SIM + GALAXY S3 LOOK. I FREQUENTLY USE CAMERA,MAILS,PLAY SONGS, INSTALL AND UNSTALL APPS FROM PLAY STORE :-). S DUOS IS HAVING 5 MP CAMERA WITH LED FLASH WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"AS PER THE PRICE I.E. 13K I CONSIDER THIS SMARTPHONE TO BE THE BEST AMONG ALL ITS RIVALS.YOU CAN CHECK THE SPECS AND OTHER STUFFS OF OTHER RIVALS SUCH AS HTC,XPERIA,NOKIA ETC IN THE PRICE RANGE 11K-16K. REST IT WILL SUIT YOUR POCKET AND YOU WILL HAVE A VALUE FOR MONEY AS I DONT THINK IT IS WORTH TO SPEND AROUND 30K+ ON SMARTPHONES AS AGAIN IN THE NEXT 2-3 MONTH ONE MORE SMARTPHONE PHONE MAY ARISE WITH BETTER SPECS AND CONFIGURATION. BUT ITS TOTALLY MY PERCEPTION AND THIS SMARTPHONE SATISFIED ME. REGARDING THE PROS YOU CAN EASILY GET FROM THE SPECS BUT I CAN SAY ABOUT THE CONS:
      
      1. NOT SUITABLE FOR DIEHARD GAME LOVERS AS IT MAY LAG AT TIMES WHILE PLAYING BUT YOU CAN SEE THE PRICE, ITS ONLY 13 K SO EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE LESS.
      
      2. YOU CANNOT PLAY HD VIDEOS I.E. OF 1080 P .
      
      
      THE ATTRACTIVE FEATURE OF THIS PHONE IS IT HAS THE LOOK AND FEEL OF S III AND THE RESOLUTION IS ALSO AWESOME.REST I LIKED THE PHONE DUE TO ITS PRICE. YOU MUST BE WONDERING AS I AM STICKING UP TO THE PRICE TAG. IT IS BECAUSE BEFORE JANUARY 2013 THE PRICE WAS 17K THEN IT DROPPED TO 15K AND NOW AGAIN IT HAS DROPPED TO A LUCRATIVE 13K AND AFTER THAT I BOUGHT THIS."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"AWESOME PHONE WITH NICE LOOK AND FEATURES, JUST GO FOR IT. I  HAVE GOT THIS PRODUCT RECENTLY AND AND HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT THIS IS THE BEST PHONE IN THIS RANGE.
      
      1- COOL LOOK,
      
      2- CLASSY TOUCH,
      
      3- EASY TO HANDLE,

Galaxy S Duos,4,"BEFORE PURCHASING EVERY ONE LIKE ME WANTS TO GO THRU THE REVIEW, BUT MANY HAD WRITTEN TOO NEGATIVE ON THIS PRODUCT, BUT FINALLY I PURCHASED THRU THIS SITE AND AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE ITS EFFECT. THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME AND TOO HELPFUL LIKE ME WHO TRAVELS MORE AND WANTS TO BE CONNECTED WITH INTERNET AND PH CALL CALLS.
      
      SECONDLY, THE DISPLAY OF THE PRODUCT IS TOO ATTRACTIVE AND HELPFUL. THE INPUTS ARE ALSO AMAZING AND IN NEED TO ANY ONE. SO, JUST GO AHEAD AND PURCHASE IT. MORE OVER IF YOU DONT WANT TO PAY ALL IN CASH , THERE ARE OPTIONS OF EMI AND IT REALLY WORKS.

Galaxy S Duos,4,"DEAR GUYS

      1GHZ PROCESSOR
      
      768MB RAM

      WHEN NEED DUAL MODE SOME WHAT SLOW.
      
      
      CONS.
      
      BATTERY BACK UP PARTICULARLY WHILE USING INTERNET OR ELSE GOOD."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"DELIVERY WAS ULTRA-FAST (~24 HOURS FROM ORDER PLACEMENT), WHICH IS AMAZING.
      
      
      RETAIL VENDORS WERE PROVIDING AN SD CARD AND SOME GOODIES WITH THIS PHONE WHEN SOLD AT 12,000/- AND WITHOUT THE GOODIES AT 10,600/-
      
      
      I PAID 12000/- AND DID NOT GET ANY GOODIES, WHICH DISAPPOINTS ME!
      
      
      THE PHONE IS SLIGHTLY SLOW, BUT SINCE THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT FLIPKART'S SERVICE, I DO NOT WANT TO TALK MUCH ABOUT THE PHONE'S CAPABILITIES. AFTERALL, FLIPKART IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SAMSUNG'S MISTAKES :)"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"EXCEPT THESE 2 CONS, THIS PHONE IS WORKING GREAT -
      
      
      1) SPEED IS NOT AT ALL AS IT SHOULD BE OF AN ANDROID DEVICE WITH 1GHZ PROCESSOR AND 768 MB RAM.
      
      
      2) THERE ARE VERY LESS HD VIDEO FORMAT SUPPORTED BY THIS PHONE, I NEED TO CONVERT MKV, AVI, WMV, FLV &AMP; A FEW MORE TO THE FORMATS LIKE MP4, MPEG, H.264 &AMP; EVEN 3GP TO WATCH VIDEO.
      
      
      OTHER THAN THESE, THIS ONE IS A GOOD BUY.
      
      
      SO OVERALL..... 4 STARS."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"FIRST OF ALL INSTALL THE LATEST UPDATE. THOSE FACING HANGING PROBLEM, GO TO DEVELOPERS OPTION IN SETTINGS. IN IT,GO TO APPS AND THERE LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BACKGROUND APPS TO 2-3.
      
      NOT GOOD FOR GAMERS BUT VERY GOOD FOR ITS PRICE. BATTERY IS GOOD. BUILD QUALITY IS SUPERB."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"FIRST OF ALL IW OULD THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR THERE FAST DELIVERY SERVICE.
      
      THE PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE GOOD IN THAT RANGE OF PRICE.
      
      THIS PHONE LOOK AND WEIGHT ARE FINE.
      
      WHILE USING THIS PHONE WHAT I AM FACING ARE:
      
      
      -BATTERY BACKUP IS NOT AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE MENTIONED.
      
      -THE SPEED OF PHONE IS AVERAGE
      
      -THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS ONLY 1.69GB NOT 4GB AS THEY HAVE MENTIONED ON TECHNICAL SPEC.
      
      
      APART FROM THIS PHONE NICE AND SOUND QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD.
      
      HEADPHONE IS SUPER WITH ENOUGH BASS.
      
      
      BUT HEADPHONE EAR SPEAKER STYLE IS NOT COMFORTABLE FOR EAR.
      
      
      THATS IT."

Galaxy S Duos,4,"HI I'M USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST TWO WEEKS.
      
      THIS IS A GOOD DUAL SIM PHONE TO BUY.
      
      IT HAS WONDERFUL CAMERA GIVING YOU EXCELLENT PICTURE QUALITY EVEN IN THE DULL LIGHT.
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD. IT'S FRONT FACING CAMERA ALSO GOOD BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO CALL IF OTHERS GOT BIG RESOLUTION SCREEN AS IT HAS 0.3 MP FRONT FACING CAMERA.
      
      
      I'M DISAPPOINTED IN ONLY ONE ISSUE IN PLAYING BACK HD VIDEOS WHICH ARE DOWNLOADED FROM FEW SITES LIKE YOUTUBE, VIDEOPIMP..ETC.
      
      
      EASY ADOPTABLE DESIGN ENABLES YOU TO HANDLE THE PHONE SAFE AND EASIER IN HAND.
      
      
      COMING TO THE DISPLAY OF THE SCREEN IT'S REALLY AWESOME. NO WORRIES TOWARDS DISPLAY.
      
      
      OVERALL I GIVE A 4 STAR RATING."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I AM REALLY EAGER TO BUY THIS MODEL,
      
      BUT SOME OF MY FRIENDS TOLD ME NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE CZ IT HAS A PROBLEMS LIKE.
      
      - WHEN WE ARE USING INTERNET IN IT WE CAN NOT RECEIVE ANY INCOME CALL AS WELL OUTGOING CALLS.
      
      - SECONDLY IT HAS A BATTERY BACKUP PROBLEM, NEED TO CHARGE TWICE A DAY (WITHIN 24 HRS.)
      
      ANY ONE USER OF THIS MODEL PLEASE COMMENT  HELP TO HAVE THIS HANDSET OR NOT."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I AM USING THIS PHONE SINCE ONE MONTH. TILL DATE I HAVE NOTICED FEW THING REGARDING THIS PHONE. FIRSTLY, I MUST ADMIT THAT I AM NOT A 'GADGET GURU'. I DON'T HAVE MUCH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT RAM, PROCESSOR AND VARIOUS OTHER OBJECTS PRESENT INSIDE THE PHONE. I JUST MAKE CALLS, TEXT, PLAY LITTLE BIT LOW END GAMES, BROWSE INTERNET A BIT, TAKE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THE CAMERA, WATCH HD MP4 VIDEO, LISTEN TO MUSIC THATS IT. SO, FOR ME THE IS GREAT. AND NOT YET HANGED SO FAR. NOW THE MAIN POINTS...
      
      BEAUTY:
      
      1. VERY NICE LOOKS.
      
      2. FRONT CAMERA.
      
      3. VERY NICE SCREEN THOUGH ITS NOT AMOLED OR SUPER AMOLED, BUT ITS GOOD. (233 PPI)
      
      4. SMART DUAL SIM FEATURE.
      
      5. CAMERA QUALITY IS NICE.
      
      6. MUSIC QUALITY IS CLEAR AND GOOD.
      
      7. TOUCH IS ALSO UP TO THE MARK.
      
      8. CALL QUALITY &AMP; NETWORK RECEIVING QUALITY IS GOOD AS WELL.
      
      9. MICROSD CARD CAN BE UNMOUNTED WITHOUT TURNING OF THE PHONE.
      
      
      SPOTS:
      
      1. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF LAG IN TOUCH, MESSAGING, CALL LOGS &AMP; DIALLING.
      
      2. TIME AUTOMATICALLY INCREASES BY 4 MINS IF YOUR NETWORK PROVIDER DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF AUTO UPDATING OF DATE &AMP; TIME.
      
      3. AS I SAID SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD BUT NOT MUCH LOUD. SAME WITH THE RINGTONE.
      
      4. GETS HEATED UP MUCH FASTER WHILE BROWSING.
      
      5. SIM CARDS ARE NOT HOT-SWAPABLE. ONLY SIM SLOT 1 IS 3G.
      
      
      OTHER THAT THIS FEW PROBLEMS, THE PHONE IS A CANDY. I'M LOVING IT! :-)"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PHONE!  IT'S FINE FOR CALLING!  IT'S FINE FOR SURFING.  I'M NO GAMER SO I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS INVOLVED WITH THAT.  IT'S A HUGE JUMP UP AND FORWARD FROM MY 2 YEAR OLD NOKIA!  BUT YES, THE BATTERY NEEDS CHARGING EVERY SO OFTEN!"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 1 WEEK AGO, I AM REALLY SATISFIED WITH THE FEATURES THAT OFFERED TO ME WITH LESS MONEY, 1 GHZ PROCESSOR, AROUND 750 RAM(U WILL GET 645),5 MP WITH LED FLASH, 4 GB INTERNAL MEMORY(U WILL GET 1.8 USER MEMORY),32 GB EXPANDABLE, 4 INCHES SCREEN. I AM TOTALLY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT, BUT THE ONLY ONE THING IS I AM NOT GETTING THE MOVE TO SD CARD OPTION TO MOVE THE INSTALLED APPS OR GAMES.EXCEPT THIS EVERYTHING IS GOOD."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY WIFE, WHO IS FIRST TIME USER OF ANDROID PLATFORM. IN GENERAL SHE FOUND  THIS VERY HANDY. CLEARLY 2 SIM SLOTS ARE GIVEN WHICH ARE NOT BELOW BATTERY WHICH IS WELCOME MOVE, ONLY ISSUE IS THAT WHEN YOU CHANGE SIM OR INSER NEW SIM IT REQUIRES A RESTART. DON'T KEEP HIGH EXPECTATIONS IF YOU ARE USER OF IPHONE OR S3 OR ADVANCE SMART PHONE. FOR THE PRICE THIS IS ENTRY-TO-MEDIUM LEVEL SMART PHONE FROM SAMSUNG
      
      FLIPKART WAS GREAT IN DELIVERING THIS ON TIME AGAIN."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM A SAMSUNG STORE NEARBY. THE PHONE IS REALLY GOOD AND I ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ON IT. BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD OR DESCENT, I PLAYED GAMES WHOLE DAY AND STILL I HAD ABOUT 40% OF BATTERY. WELL WE CANNOT DO HEAVY MULTI TASKING WITH THIS AS IT WILL SLOW DOWN A BIT BUT STILL IT RUNS SMOOTHLY WITH AROUND 6-7 SOFTWARE RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND.
      
      
      ITS JUST PERFECT FOR THE PRICE. WE CAN'T GET MUCH BETTER DUAL SIM SMARTPHONE OF A STANDARD COMPANY."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I COMPARED THIS PHONE WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE. I FOUND THAT S ADVANCE IS NOT HAVING ZOOM OPTION 4 ITS CAM....THAT'S Y THIS IS THE BEST BUY...
      
      U CAN ALSO TRY, SONY XPERIA J AND SONY XPERIA NEO L WHICH ARE HAVING SIMILAR SPECS.....ENJOY THE ULTIMATE SMARTPHONE XPERIENCE ;)"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I GOT THIS PHONE ON SPENDING 11K AND WITHIN THIS PRICE RANGE I CAN BET THIS IS THE BEST DUAL SIM PHONE IN THE MARKET, I WILL REPEAT ""THE BEST DUAL SIM PHONE"" THOUGH IT GETS SLOW SOMETIMES BUT IF YOU KNOW THE USE OF RAM MEMORY ERASE THEN IT WILL WORK SMOOTH..."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THE GALAXY S DUOS FOR A WEEK NOW. IF YOU WANT A CURRENT DUAL SIM ANDROID PHONE WITH A REASONABLE FEATURE SET AND PRICE RANGE, THIS IS IT.
      
      
      PREVIOUSLY, I WAS USING A GALAXY S2, WHEN WORK DEMANDED THAT I ADD ANOTHER SIM. IT IS A PAIN LUGGING AROUND TWO PHONES. I WAS FIXATED ON AN SAMSUNG+ANDROID BECAUSE I WAS USED TO IT AND DIDN'T WANT TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.
      
      
      THE MAIN PHONES I CONSIDERED WERE GALAXY Y, GALAXY YOUNG, GALAXY S DUOS AND GRAND DUOS. WHILE THE FIRST TWO MADE ECONOMIC SENSE, I SOUGHT MORE FROM MY SMART PHONE. THE GRAND DUOS WAS JUST LIKE THE GALAXY S3, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO SHELL OUT THAT MUCH AGAIN FOR A PHONE.
      
      
      THE GALAXY S DUOS LAGS A BIT COMPARED TO THE S2, BUT IS RESPONSIVE ENOUGH FOR THE PRICE ASKED. FEATURE SET REASONABLE, WITH ANDROID 4.0.4 AS ON 30TH APRIL 2013. APPS WORK WITHOUT ANY GLITCHES SO FAR. I DON'T USE MY PHONE CAMERA MUCH. BATTERY LASTS FOR 14 HOURS FOR ABOUT MEDIUM USAGE. MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT IT ISN'T A BALANCED BUILD AND PROBABLY WON'T LAST TWO YEARS. THIS IS A GOOD STOP GAP PHONE, IF THE GAP IS A YEAR ATLEAST. HOPEFULLY, IT LASTS TWO YEARS."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT ASHA 311 FROM FLIPKART. I HAVE SEEN THIS PHONE TOO AT THAT TIME. IT'S EXPENSIVE MORE THEN WHAT THEY HAVE.
      
      
      ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATION PHONE IS AWESOME. IN 2013 PAYING A BIG MONEY TO SAMSUNG IS REALLY NOT GOOD.
      
      
      BETTER TO WAIT TO 2014 WHEN UBUNTU AND FIREFOX OS COME. THAT TIME THIS PHONE WILL GO DOWN THEIR PRICE OR BETTER ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE THROUGH FLIPKART AROUND 5 MONTHS BACK. NO SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS TO BE MENTIONED. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE PROS AND CONS I COULD NOTE:
      
      PROS:
      
      *A STYLISH SLEEK PHONE WITH DECENT FEATURES
      
      *GOOD FOR INTERNET USAGE USING WIFI AS WELL AS MOBILE INTERNET
      
      *DECENT AUDIO QUALITY AND A GOOD VIDEO QUALITY
      
      CONS:
      
      *THE ACTUAL AVAILABLE RAM IS ONLY 512MB
      
      *CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT AS AWESOME AS WE IMAGINE FOR A 5MP CAMERA
      
      *BATTERY IS NOT THAT EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD FOR INTERNET USERS
      
      
      OVERALL, IF YOU WANT A BRANDED PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE WITH MID RANGE FEATURES, GO FOR IT."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I HAVE PURCHASED IT FROM MARKET.
      
      TILL ONE WEEK GO.
      
      NO DOUBT PHONE IS BEST IN THE RANGE OF 13000/- IN COMPARE TO OTHER BRAND.
      
      PROS:
      
      1. SCREEN RESOLUTION IS VERY GOOD( THOUGH NOT AMOLED).
      
      2. COMES WITH ANDROID 4.0.4.
      
      3. BUILT, LOOK AND GRIP OF PHONE IS GOOD IN THIS RANGE.
      
      4. DUAL SIM.
      
      5. CAMERA IS AVERAGE, BUT COMES WITH FLASH.
      
      6. BATTERY BACKUP IS OK.
      
      CONS:
      
      1. SINGLE CORE 1GHZ PROCESSOR SO I FEEL LEG IN SCROLLING AND APPLICATION OPENING.
      
      2. USABLE MEMORY IS JUST 1.7 TO 2 GB SO YOU NEED SD CARD.
      
      
      FINALLY IF UR BUDGET IS AROUND 13K THAN THIS IS THE BEST PHONE.
      
      GO FOR IT..."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS HANDSET 5-6 MONTHS BACK FOR 14.5K. HANDSET IS GOOD, EXCEPT IT HANGS RARELY AND BATTERY BACKUP IS NOT SO GOOD. AS GETS DISCHARGED WHEN APPS ARE RUNNING OR ON LISTENING AUDIO/VIDEO'S (MIGHT BE THE SAME CASE WITH ALL HANDSETS). BUT AS THE PRICE IS 11.5 -12K, SO I THINK MIDRANGE SMARTPHONE, ONE CAN BUY THIS."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I HAVE THE PHONE FOR 5 MONTH TILL NOW . I HAVE PLAYED ALMOST MANY GAMES . APPS ETC . THIS PHONE SOMETIME HANGS OUT A LITTLE BUT WE COULD PLAY ALMOST EVERY GAMES. ITS GRAPHICS IS GOOD AND TEMPLE RUN ETC GAMES ARE RUNNING AWESOME &GT;
      
      BUT THIS HAVE A DISADVANTAGE THE THE APP TO  SD  IS NOT WORKING. WE CANNOT STORE MORE APPS ON THE PHONE .
      
      AND WHEN WE USE UTORRENT BITA ETC WE CANT DOWNLOAD  IT BECAUSE IT SAYS LOW INTERNAL MEMORY ."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I HAVE USED THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND HAVE OBSERVED THE FOLLOWING :-
      
      
      DISPLAY - THE 4 INCH TFT DISPLAY HAS A SUPERB CLARITY WITH THE QVGA RESOLUTION.
      
      SCRATCHES FALL EASILY ON THE SCREEN. HAVE TO WIPE THE SCREEN ALMOST EVERY HOUR.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE - ONE DISAPPOINTMENT IS THE SINGLE CORE A5 PROCESSOR. FOR 15K WE EXPECT A
      
      MINIMUM A9 PROCESSOR. OTHER THAN THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER.
      
      WE COULD HAVE EXPECTED A BETTER GPU OTHER THAN THE ENTRY LEVEL ADRENO 200
      
      BUT THIS COMBINED WITH THE 1 GHZ PROCESSOR DELIVERS IMPECCABLE PERFORMANCE.
      
      ICS OS RUNS PRETTY SMOOTHLY WITHOUT ANY LAGS.
      
      
      CAMERA - THE 5MP CAM MAKES SURE THAT THE PHOTOS ARE OF TOP-NOTCH QUALITY. ALTHOUGH LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHS MAY NOT BE AS GOOD. VIDEO RECORDING CAN BE DONE UPTO 480P. THIS IS NOT EXACTLY A CAMERA-PHONE.
      
      
      BATTERY - THE BATTERY BACKUP IS REALLY FANTASTIC. IT RUNS A WHOLE DAY EVEN IF YOU HAVE IT
      
      CONTINUOUSLY.
      
      
      OTHER FEATURES - THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE IS THAT THIS PHONE IS CAPABLE OF BEING UPGRADED JELLY
      
      BEAN!!
      
      THE KEYBOARD IS ALSO PRETTY MUCH SMOOTH AND IT IS EASY TO TYPE WITH THE SWIPE
      
      FACILITY."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I LOVE THIS PHONE. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A NOKIA USER AND TRUTH BE TOLD I DO MISS THE DURABILITY OF NOKIA, BUT SAMSUNG MAKES UP FOR IT WITH THE COOL FEATURES. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE PHONE IS THAT SOMETIMES THE INTERNET STOPS WORKING AND YOU HAVE TO RESTART IT."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I PURCHASED THIS OF INR RS. 14150/. EXCELLENT PIECE, VALID FOR MONEY. EXCELLENT USE IF WE USE FOR PHONE PURPOSE THAN GAMES.
      
      
      THE MAIN DRAWBACK IS JUST  POWER SWITCH ON IS VERY SLOW. EVERYTHING IS FINE."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"I WANTED TO BUY MY FIRST ANDROID MOBILE. I WAS PLANNING TO BUY THE MICROMAX CANVAS 2 BUT MY DAD TOLD ME TO BUY THIS ONE. THIS IS A GREAT PIECE WITH A GREAT LOOK OF THE GALXY S3. I BOUGHT IT FROM A LOCAL SAMSUNG STORE AT THE PRICE 11,599. IT CAN PLAY 720P VIDEOS BUT NOT THE 1080P VIDEOS IN THE MX PLAYER PRO. THE SOUND OF THE MOBILE IS GREAT AND YOU GET AN IN EAR HEADPHONES. IT HAS A GREAT TOUCH COMPARATIVELY TO THE MICROMAX CANVAS 2. I WOULD RATE IT 4STARS BECAUSE OF THE SIGLE CORE PROCESSOR."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"IF WE COMPARE THIS PHONE WITH THE OTHER PHONES AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET AT SAME PRICE RANGE, PHONE HAS THE PLUS POINT AND BETTER PERFORMANCE. CAMERA WITH FLASH IS GOOD. SCREEN IS FLAWLESS. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS BEST IN THIS CLASS &AMP; PRICE RANGE.
      
      THERE IS ONLY PROBLEM WITH DIFFERENT FORMAT VIDEO PLAYING."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"IF YOU ARE NOT USING FOR GAMES THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU.
      
      NOT PROBLEMS WITH ALL THE OTHER TASKS INCLUDING MUCH TALKED BATTERY.INSTALLED ALL THE APPS LIKE EBOOKS BANKING VIDEO PLAYERS AND SOME SECURITY APPS NOT PROBLEMS TO RUN THESE BUT HAS TO UNINSTALL ALL GAMES."
Galaxy S Duos,4,IF YOU BUY THIS PHONE...GO FOR WHITE...ITS REALLY CHEEKY...CAMERA QUALITY IS PRETTY DESCENT.....BUT THE PHONE HANGS A LOT....EAR PHONES ARE OSSUM......WHEN DUAL SIM IS ON...BATTERY ENDS LIKE ANYTHING...IT DOESNT EVEN COMPLETE A DAY WITH OUT CHARGE....PRICE OF 12000 IS QUITE FIT FOR THIS PODUCT..GO FOR IT.........FLIPKART DELIVERS LIKE NO OTHER..........
Galaxy S Duos,4,"ITS A GOOD LOW BUDGET PHONE WHICH OFFERS YOU ALMOST EVERYTHING!
      
      THE CAMERA AND FLASH PUT A TOUGH BENCHMARK TO OTHER PHONES.
      
      THE DISPLAY QUALITY AS ALWAYS IS PRETTY NICE BY SAMSUNG.
      
      THERE IS JUST ONE PROBLEM WHICH I AM FACING WITH THIS DEVICE IS THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TRANSFER THE APPLICATIONS FROM THE PHONE MEMORY TO THE MEMORY CARD.
      
      I HAV TRIED ALOT OF APPS FOR IT BUT NO USE!
      
      A MEMORY CARD WITH THIS DEVICE WOULD B UNDER UTLISED!
      
      WELL ON THE WHOLE THIS PHONE IS GREAT!
      
      GAMES DO HANG SUM TIMES DUE TO THE HEAVY ICE CREAM SANDWICH BUT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE IT!!
      
      ON THE WHOLE AN OUTSTANDING EFFORT BY SAMSUNG!!"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"IT'S A VERY GOOD PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE BUT IT WORKS SMOOTHLY IN SINGLE SIM ONLY, WHILE USING TWO SIM IT STARTS LAGGING
      
      TOUCH IS NOT SO SMOOTH AND THE BODY IS SO PLASTICKY WHICH I FOUND NOKIA PHONES HAVE BEST IN THIS RANGE"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"M USING DIS MOBILE FROM LAST 1 MONTH
      
      OVERALL MOBILE IS VERY GOOD.
      
      DUAL SIM WITH SO MUCH FACILITIES. GREAT.......
      
      BATERRY IS GOOD
      
      SECONDARY CAMERA. LED.
      
      ONLY 13K.
      
      GOOD LOOKS. SLIM
      
      
      ONLY 1 MINUS POINT IS DAT MOBILE IS A BIT SLOW.
      
      HAVE TO BUY SCREEN GUARD &AMP; COVER EXTRA
      
      SO EXTRA 300 RUPEES"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"NICE I WANT TO BUY THIS SMARTPHONE I REALLY LIKE IT...NOW IM USING GALAXY Y DOUS (GT-S6102).....BUT ITS INTERNAL MEMORY IS MENTIONED 4GB. BUT IN IN SAMSUNG MENTIONED ONLY 2GB...
      
      PLZ.. CLAARIFY MY DOUBT..."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"NICE PHONE AND SUPER FAST DELIVERY. GOT THE PHONE WITHIN 48 HOURS, THE BEST FUNCTION WHICH I LIKED IS GPS NAVIGATION, IT GIVES ABSOLUTELY EXACT INFORMATION, HOWEVER NOT THAT GOOD FOR GAMING. BATTERY BACKUP IS FINE"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"ONE OF MY FRIEND BROUGHT THIS PHONE AND THE SERVICE OF FLIPKART IS JUST AMAZING DELIVERED IN JUST TWO DAYS.
      
      SO I ORDERED THIS PHONE AGAIN AND WAITING FOR THIS JUMBO TO ARRIVE.
      
      ONLY ONE PROBLEM WHITE THIS PHONE IS WE CAN'T MOVE APPS TO SD CARD.
      
      OTHER THAN THAT I RECOMMEND TO ALL TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"PLACED THE ORDER LAST SUNDAY MORNING AND GUESS WHAT MONDAY EVENING I WAS HOLDING THE MOBILE. NOW THAT'S SUPERRR EXPRESS DELIVERY FROM FLIPKART, WHICH IS EXCEEDING MY EXPECTATIONS WITH EVERY NEW ORDER I PLACE. NOW COMING TO THE PHONE,I WAS LOOKING FOR A DECENT LOOKING PHONE WITH SCREEN NO LESS THAT 4"", I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR PAST TWO DAYS AND HERE IS MY CANDID OPINION:
      
      PROS:
      
      1.LOOKS TRENDY AND RESEMBLES THE GALAXY S2/S3/GRAND. ALTHOUGH 'GRAND' WAS WITHIN MY BUDGET BUT CHOSE OVER IT CONSIDERING EASE USAGE, EASILY FITS IN THE PALM AND JEANS POCKET.
      
      2. APPEALING USER INTERFACE WITH SMOOTH TOUCH EXPERIENCE AND EASE OF USE(ESPECIALLY IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST ENTRY INTO THE SMART PHONE WORLD). OPINION BASED ON MY PREVIOUS HTC 'EXPLORER' USAGE EXPERIENCE.
      
      3. RANKED HIGH AMOUNG OTHER PLAYERS IN 4"" AND COST&LT; 15K SEGMENT(HTC 'DESIRE' - COSTS 2K MORE/NO FRONT CAM AND SONY 'XPERIA NEO' - LOWER RAM AND INTERNAL MEMORY )
      
      4.COMPARATIVELY MORE SAFE: LOWEST SAR VALUE
      
      5.UPGRADABLE TO JELLY BEAN ANDROID OS: JUST HAVE THIS INFO AND YET TO GET THIS DONE ON MINE.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. ALTHOUGH BATTERY BACKUP IS FINE FOR NOMINAL USAGE, TENDS TO DRAIN OUT QUICK WITH WIFI USAGE AND CONTINUOUS OPERATION... ALTHOUGH STAYED FOR 6 HRS FROM LAST CHARGING WITH HEAVY TO MODERATE USAGE.
      
      2. HEATS UP WHEN CONTINUOUS BROWSING THROUGH WIFI.
      
      3. TOUCH RESPONSE MAY TEND TO LAG SOMETIMES(OCCASIONALLY) ALTHOUGH WILL BE IN MICROSEC'S YET NOTICEABLE.
      
      4. SOUND QUALITY INFERIOR COMPARED TO SONY, ALTHOUGH SERVES THE PURPOSE.
      
      
      OVERALL THIS PHONE POSSESSION HAS LIVED UP TO MY EXPECTATION AND I WOULD SURELY RECOMMEND FOR NEW BUYERS WHOSE REQUIREMENT ARE IN LINE WITH MINE STATED ABOVE.
      
      
      HAPPY MOBILE SHOPPING!!! :)"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"PLEASE HELP ME SELECT BETWEEN THE TWO, MY KEY CONCERNS ARE RELIABILITY , CAMERA . I REALLY LIKE THE OPEN NATURE OF ANDROID BUT THE NOKIA 520 MAKES A VERY COMPELLING BUY WHICH ONE SHOULD I CHOSE ??? CONSIDERING THE FREE GAMES AND APPS ANDROID WINS HANDS DOWN BUT BUILT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY WISE NOKIA IS ALLWAYZ THE KING PLEASE HELP ?????"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"PLS DO NOT GET CARRIED AWAY BY NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS OF FEW OF CUSTOMERS. I LOVED THIS PRODUCT AND ITS JUST TOO GOOD.
      
      WITH THIS PRICE YOU GET THE BEST DEAL.
      
      ITS FOOLISH IF YOU COMPARE THIS PRODUCT WITH HIGH END (EXPENSIVE) SMART PHONES.
      
      IF YOU LIKE IT GO FOR IT."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"PRODUCT IS GOOD. SOMETIMES THERE IS A LAG WHILE SWIPING THE SCREEN IF MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS ARE OPEN.  FOR THE FIRST TIME FLIPKART WAS A LITTLE DELAYED IN DELIVERING THE PRODUCT. IT WAS A LITTLE LONGER THAN EXPECTED. EXCEPT THAT ITS GOOD.
      
      
      DO NOT OPEN MORE THAN 5 APPS ON THIS ONE. AFTER THAT YOU MIGHT START EXPERIENCING LAGS ANYTIME. BUT FOR THE PRICE THIS FONE IS ABSOULTELY GOOD.
      
      
      ALSO BATTERY NEEDS TO BE CHARGED AFTER 3 HOURS FOR SURE IF YOUR WI-FI IS SWITCHED ON. EVEN IF ITS OFF. ONE FULL CHARGE STAYS FOR A MAXIMUM OF 4 HOURS IF YOU ARE CHATTING ON WATSAPP .
      
      
      BUT THE WIFI RADIO CHIP INSIDE IT IS VERY POWERFUL , EVEN MORE THAN THE ONE IN MY LAPTOP. DOWNLOAD FROM SAME HOME ROUTER IS FAST ON MOBILE AS COMPARED TO THE PC. THATS GOOD ONE.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL PRETTY GOOOD VALUE FOR MONEY BEING A DUAL SIM PHONE. IF YOU NEED TO KEEP TWO NUMBERS ONLINE THIS IS THE BEST FONE IN ITS PRICE."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"PROS ARE,
      
      - DUAL SIM,
      
      - FRONT CAMERA,
      
      - SMARTPHONE AT LOW PRICE (ALL THE FEATURES OF A GALAXY NOTE IS AVAIALBLE EXCEPT VERY FEW LIKE HD, S PEN ETC.
      
      
      CONS ARE,
      
      - LOW SPEED (512MB RAM),
      
      - NO HD
      
      OVERALL I CAN SAY, ""EXCEPT SPEED, EVERYTING IS GOOD""."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"PURCHASED ON 26TH MARCH, 2013 NOT FROM FLIPKART BUT FROM RETAIL SHOP. RANGE IS GOOD. A DECENT SMART PHONE WITH DUAL SIM FACILITY. NICE 3G INTERNET SPEED &AMP; CONNECTIVITY BUT ONLY PROBLEM IS BATTERY BACKUP, IT ONLY LASTED 10 HOUR MAXIMUM. BUT OTHER THING ARE REALLY GOOD. I CANT UNDERSTAND THAT WHY MANY USER DISLIKE THIS PRODUCT."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART LAST OCTOBER 2012 DURING DURGA PUJA. DELIVERY WAS IMPECCABLE. USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MY OFFICE AS WELL AS PERSONAL USE. SINCE MY JOB INVOLVES TRAVELLING A QUITE A LOT, THE PRODUCT GETS EXPOSED TO ROUGH CONDITIONS SOMETIMES. PERFORMANCE IS QUITE GOOD, BUT MAY GET HANG WHEN USED FOR VERY LONG HOURS (4-5 DAYS) AT A STRETCH. HIGH QUALITY VIDEO HANGS BECAUSE THERE ARE PRESENTLY NO GOOD APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR VIDEOS AVAILABLE IN THE ANDROID MARKET. SURFING NET IS QUITE GOOD. LISTENING MP3 OR FM IS ALSO OK. UNLIKE SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND NOW, ACCESSORY-WISE SAMSUNG WAS NOT PROVIDING ANYTHING WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART. SO I HAD NO OTHER OPTION TO BUY THE ACCESSORIES FROM INTERNET. BUT IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO BUY THIS PRODUCT NOW, I WOULD SUGGEST HIM/HER TO BUY SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND DUOS, NOT BECAUSE OF PERFORMANCE, BUT HE/SHE WOULD GET A GOOD SCREEN SIZE ALONG WITH THE WHOLE ACCESSORIES PACKAGE THAT I WAS NOT GETTING AT THAT TIME AT A COST OF RS. 20,500 AGAINST AROUND RS. 17000 I PAID FOR THIS PRODUCT."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"S DUOS IS REALLY GOOD SMARTPHONE. I HAVE BEEN PURCHASE THIS ONE LAST WEEK. I WANT TO SAY ONLY ONE THING...... BRAND IS BRAND. S DUOS HAVE SUPERB QUALITY CAMERA, VERY GOOD TOUCH SCREEN, SPEED ACCORDING TO 1GHZ PROCESSOR IS AWESOME NO DOUBT, 4 INCH SCREEN GIVE SMOOTHNESS GAMING EXPERIENCE IS SUPERB ALL FAVOURITE GAME RUN SMOOTHLY NO LAGS......IF U R GOOD SMARTPHONE USERS THIS IS FOR U................BRILLIANT TECH..GOOD JOB SAMSUNG."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND + POSITIVES :
      
      
      ITS LOOK IS LIKE S3
      
      DUAL SIM DUAL STNADBY
      
      4 INCH TFT TOUCH SCREEN
      
      PERFECT FOR OUR POCKET AND PRICE
      
      
      -NEGATIVES :
      
      
      RESOLUTION IS NOT MUCH GREAT
      
      LOW END MEDIUM BUDGET"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"THANKS FLIPKART FOR THE EXCELLENT SERVICE AND DELIVERING ON THE THIRD DAY OF ORDER PLACED.
      
      
      FOR STARTER.... WE ARE NOT REVIEWING A 30K+ PRODUCT. HENCE, LETS FORGET THE S3'S, APPLES, HTC TOP END ETC....
      
      
      ITS A DECENT PHONE WITH 1 GHZ PROCESSING, MAYBE OLD BUT IT WORKS... 768 RAM, QUITE DECENT AND A NICE DISPLAY WHICH IS QUITE PLEASING AND VIEWABLE.
      
      
      ONE GETS TO USE 2 GB ONBOARD MEMORY AND I GOT A BUNDLED 8 GB CARD AND FREE ATITUDE FLIPCOVER.. DEF ICING ON THE CAKE.
      
      
      THE OS WHETHER GINGERBREAD OR ICS IS A NO BRAINER FOR ME, THE INTERFACE IS SMOOTH.
      
      
      THE BATTERY COULD HAVE BEEN OF A HIGHER MAH, BUT IM NOT COMPLAINING. IT LASTS CLOSE TO 1.5 DAYS WITH NORMAL USE... TOO MUCH(2-3 HRS) OF WIFI/ GAMING WILL BRING IT DOWN TO 6 HRS.
      
      
      OVERALL A DECENT PACKAGE AT 15K.... ALL MICROMAX AND KARBON LOVERS, SORRY BUT THE BATTERY OF THESE PHONES ARE NOT PRETTY DURABLE... THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A DIFF BETWEEN A INHOUSE PRODUCTION AND OUTSOURCED LOCAL COMPANY.
      
      
      CHEERS!!! HAPPY CELL PHONE HUNTING!! :)"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"THE PRODUCT IS GOOD AND WORTH THE PRICE THE ONLY NEGATIVE THING IS SLIGHT LAGGING ELSE ITS NICE DONT GO ON NEGATIVE REVIEWS.
      
      
      TOUCH INTERFACE IS SMOOTH AND APPS ARE DECENT CALL QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD. DONT EXPECT GALAXY S3 OR SIMILAR PERFORMANCE, KEEP ONE THING IN MIND AND THAT IS ITS PRICE AND BRAND VALUE, THOUGH THERE ARE OPTIONS AS XOLO, MICROMAX ETC IN MARKET."
Galaxy S Duos,4,THE PRODUCT IS GOOD IF U R NOT A GAME LOVER.. DUAL SIM MAKES LIFE EASY THAN CAARYING TWO MOBILES..THE SCREEN IS VERY SMOOTH &AMP; QUITE A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE THE ONLY DARK SIDE IS YOU CAN'T MOVE APPS TO SD CARD BUT STILL ITS A GOOD PHONE IN THIS RANGE THATS THE REASON I M GIVING FOUR STAR ... JUST GO FOR IT
Galaxy S Duos,4,"THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT. CHEAP AND BEST
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD
      
      SURFING BETWEEN DIFFERENT FEATURES AND THE NET IS ALSO QUITE FAST.
      
      I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL CHEAP &AMP; BEST ...
      
      REALLY EXCELLENT  ........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DUEL SIM PHONE FOR 13K PRICE BAND. UI IS FLAWLESS FOR AVERAGE USE WITH MINIMUM MULTITASKING. OPTIMUM FEATURE AND GOOD IMAGE REPRODUCTION FOR AN ADRENO 200. ENOUGH MEMORY FOR APPS. I ACTUALLY USE ONE SIM FOR CALLING AND 2ND FOR DATA AND IT WORKS JUST FINE. UNBELIEVABLY GOOD MUSIC PERFORMANCE FROM IN BOX EARPHONE.
      
      
      CONS- LOUDSPEAKER AND RINGING VOLUME COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. BLUETOOTH DATA TRANSFER SEAM TO BE SLUGGISH.
      
      
      VERDICT- VERY GOOD FOR ANDROID BEGINNERS AS THEY WILL LOVE IT."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"THIS PHONE IN A BUDGET OF 13-14K IS FAR BETTER THAN MANY PHABLETS HANGING AROUND THESE DAYS. OBVIOUSLY YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW WILL THE LOW COST PHABLETS PERFORM IN COMING 1-2 YEARS BUT AT-LEAST YOU KNOW THAT SAMSUNG IS MUCH BETTER PHONE TO BE WITH. ONE ISSUE THAT I HAVE FACED WITH THIS PHONE IS THAT WITH DUAL SIM &AMP; 3G THE BATTERY LASTS FOR ABOUT 3/4TH DAY, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW LONG THE LOW COSTS PHABLETS WITH BIGGER SCREEN ETC KEEP UP FOR THE FULL DAY."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"THOSE WHO ARE COMPARING FEATURES PLEASE KNOW THIS! BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS COST MORE.
      
      
      COMING BACK TO GALAXY S DUOS!! IT'S A REALLY NICE PHONE. VALUE FOR MONEY I WOULD SAY. SMART AND SLEEK LOOK. LOOKS SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH. ANDROID PHONES HAVE A TENDENCY TO BE PRONE TO INITIAL HICCUPS AND MY PHONE IS NO DIFFERENT BUT A LITTLE CHECKING UP IN THE SERVICE CENTER WOULD MAKE THE PHONE RUN LIKE LAMBORGHINI.... HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD SAY AT RS 13000 THIS PHONE IS A POWER HOUSE. COMING FROM SAMSUNG THIS IS A JEWEL. DUAL ACTIVE, 5 MP PRIMARY CAMERA THAT CLICKS PICTURES AS GOOD AS A BASIC COMPACT CAMERA DOES, A SECONDARY CAMERA FOR VIDEO CHAT ADDICTS, LED FLASH, 4"" TFT SCREEN(IF THE TOUCH IS SO SMOOTH WHO NEEDS SUPER AMOLED), 1 GHZ PROCESSOR, ICS OS UPGRADABLE TO JB,ETC. THOUGH THE BATTERY BACKUP COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER YET CONSIDERING THE HOST OF FEATURES THIS PHONE OFFERS ONE CAN OVERLOOK THE BATTERY BACKUP(WHICH IS NOT BAD ACTUALLY).
      
      
      CHEERS TO SAMSUNG FOR THIS CHAMP..........."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"VERY NICE PHONE AT 12900 (EVEN LESS AT SOME SITES). PLEASE IGNORE THE COMMENTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLAINING IT FOR TOO SLOW .....IT ONLY SLOWS DOWN IF U INSTALL SOME HEAVY APPS.
      
      
      BUT ITS THE BEST PHONE"
Galaxy S Duos,4,"WAKE UP  ALARM MUST WORK EVEN WHEN  SWITCHED OFF;  VOLUME TOO LOW TO WAKE; YOU CANT IMPORT THE TUNES YOU LIKE AND INSTALL AS ALERT ; NO INDICATION WHETHER THE PHONE IS ON 3G OR 2G; GETS HOT VERY FAST
      
      ON THE PLUS SIDE LIGHT WEIGHT;GOOD LOOKS ;CLEAR HD VIDEO; LOTS OF APPS AND MANY GOOD USEFUL FEATURES; VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE SLASHED  FROM 21000 TO 13000 IN A MATTER OF 2-3 MONTHS ;SOLD  IN VERY GOOD NUMBERS SOON WILL BECOME OUT OF STOCK.
      
      ON THE WHOLE A GOOD BUY."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"WELL, I FOUND THIS PHONE NICE IN THIS BUDGET. OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE BUDGET MORE THAN THIS, GO FOR GALAXY GRAND. ONE THING YOU NEED TO DO IS TO CLEAR THE MEMORY 2-3 TIMES A DAY TO KEEP YOUR PHONE RUNNING SMOOTH. IT HAS BEEN AMAZING COMPANION NOW FOR ME AS I DO MY LOT OF WORK FROM THIS DEVICE ONLY AND I DON'T NEED TO OPEN MY LAPTOP MANY TIMES. 5 MP CAMERA IS ALSO GOOD AND HAS NICE RESULTS.
      
      
      ALSO, THE COVER WHICH COMES WITH THIS PHONE IS OK. I CAN'T SAY ITS BAD BUT ITS ALSO NOT REALLY GREAT. I AM STILL WAITING FOR THE JELLY BEAN UPDATE FOR THIS ONE. :(
      
      
      ANYWAYS, NICE PHONE IN THIS BUDGET. I LL PREFER GOING FOR SAMSUNG RATHER THAN MICROMAX FOR SURE."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"WELL,THIS IS A GOOD BUDGET PHONE...I HAVE READ MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON FLIPKART ON THIS PHONE HEAR AND I AM COMPLETELY AGAINST THEM.THIS PHONE IS AMAZING.I SPEAK AFTER A WEEK OF HEAVY USAGE...I HAVE DIVIDED THIS REVIEW INTO PROS,CONS,AND CONCLUSION FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1)IT HAS A DECENT 1GHZ PROCESSOR WHICH MANAGES TO GIVE YOU A SMOOTH USAGE     EXPERIENCE...GAMES LOAD A BIT SLOW BUT THATS COMPROMISABLE FOR YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A BUDGET PHONE...THIS PHONE IS NOT MEANT FOR HEAVY GAMES LIKE ASPHALT 7,ETC...REMEMBER THIS IS A SAMSUNG BUDGET PHONE...A COMPANY WHICH IS ONE OF THE BEST IN MAKING SMART PHONES,OFFER GOOD SERVICE AND HAS A GREAT AFTERSELL VALUE...I MANAGED TO PLAY CASUAL GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN 2,SUBWAY SURFERS,FRUIT NINJA,GRAVITY GUY,ETC.IT WORKS PERFECT(EXCEPT FOR COMPROMISABLE GRAPHIC REDUCTION WHICH I SHALL TALK ABOUT IN THE CONS SECTION...)
      
      2)IT HAS A 650 MB RAM WHICH IS GREAT FOR A BUDGET PHONE AND IS NOT OFFERED BY MOST OF THE DEVICES IN THIS RANGE...ITS CAPABLE OF HANDLING MODERATE TO HEAVY LOAD(NOT EXTREME LOAD BUT THATS OK...)
      
      3)THE CAMERA PHOTOS ARE GREAT..THOUGH IT DOESNT HAVE TAP TO FOCUS,THE AUTO-FOCUS WORKS WELL...THERE IS A MACRO MODE TOO WHICH IS BRILLIANT..IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY A POWERFUL FLASHLIGHT...
      
      4)THE BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT..IT LASTS ME ONE DAY ON MODERATE TO HEAVY USAGE...
      
      5)THE 3G IS LIGHTNING FAST,WIFI DIRECT IS AVAILABLE(A RATHER UNIQUE FEATURE) AND BLUETOOTH WHICH CONNECTS TO ALL DEVICES(NOT LIKE NOKIA LUMIA),PORTABLE-HOTSPOT IS THERE...BLAH BLAH
      
      6)IT HAS A FRONT CAMERA
      
      7)IT RUN ON ANDROID 4.0.4 ICS WITH SAMSUNG TOUCHWIZ...NEEDLESS TO IMPROVISE ON THIS...MY EXPERIENCE IS BUTTER SMOOTH...
      
      8)DUAL SIM,VERY USEFUL TO ME...
      
      
      I HAVE MISSED MANY PROS BECAUSE IM RATHER LAZY TO WRITE...
      
      
      CONS:
      
      BIGGEST DRAWBACK IS NO HD RECORDING AND NO 720P PLAYBACK..THIS MADE ME STRIKE A STAR OF THE RATING..GRAPHICS IN GAMES ARE A LITTLE PIXELATED BUT AGAIN THE BUDGET THING COMES HERE...NO OTHER
      
      
      CONCLUSION
      
      GO FOR IT IF YOU ARE AGAINST INDIAN BRANDS OR SIMPLY WANT A GOOD DUAL SIM PHONE..THE ONLY COMPETITOR I FEEL IS MICROMAX CANVAS HD AND MIND ME NO SONYPHONES (I SPEAK AFTER USING SONY XPERIA MIRO...)"

Galaxy S Duos,4,"WHEN YOU KNOW THIS PHONE IS HAVING A SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR WHY TRY TO PLAY GAME WITH IT. IT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE SLOW. SINCE RAM IS 645 MB NOT 768 MB TRY TO MANAGE YOUR APPS WISELY. OTHER THAN THESE TWO THINGS THIS PHONE IS FUN. I AM NOT A GAMER SO THE PHONE NEVER HANGS FOR ME. FOR THE PRICE RANGE IT HAS EXCELLENT TOUCH,DISPLAY,CAMERA. THE BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO EXCELLENT. SO MY WARNING IS IF YOU ARE A GAMER PAY A COUPLE OF THOUSANDS MORE AND GO FOR A DUAL CORE SMART PHONE ELSE YOU HAVE REAL GEM IN YOUR HAND."
Galaxy S Duos,4,"YOU DON'T GET ALL THINGS IN ONE PHONE, THIS COMES CLOSEST FOR ME KEEPING PRICE, FEATURES, DUAL SIM AND CONTEMPORARY LOOKS IN MIND.I FREQUENTLY USE CAMERA,MAILS,PLAY SONGS, INSTALL AND INSTALL APPS FROM PLAY STORE.

      1) THIS IS AN UNDER-POWERED PHONE. A SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR IN THIS DAY AND AGE IS TOTALLY OUTDATED - EVEN IF IT'S 1 GHZ. IF YOU WANT A PHONE THAT WILL GIVE YOU A LAG FREE PERFORMANCE YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER A DUAL CORE. THE SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR ON THIS PHONE WILL AFFECT PERFORMANCE. I DON'T PLAY GAMES ON THIS DEVICE. JUST HAVE WHATSAPP AND VIBER AND YET IT ENDS UP WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LAG.
      
      
      2) THIS PHONE IS FOR THOSE WHO WANT DUAL SIM FEATURES ALONG WITH THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE ANDROID OS AND DON'T WANT TO OVERSPEND. IF YOU DON'T CARE FOR HD VIDEOS AND SUPER CRISP PICTURES THEN THIS IS THE PHONE FOR YOU. IT'S A BUDGET PHONE AND ITS VALUE IS AS GOOD AS THE MONEY YOU PAY.
      
      
      3) THE BATTERY LIFE IS BETTER THAN MOST OTHER ANDROID DEVICES. HOWEVER IF YOU LEAVE YOUR 3G ON IT WILL EAT INTO YOUR BATTERY - EVEN IF IT'S ON STANDBY. WIFI ISN'T AS DRAINING AND YOU'LL GET BETTER PERFORMANCE FROM IT. IF YOU'RE ADDICTED TO THE INTERNET THEN THIS PHONE WILL DRAIN OUT IN HOURS.
      
      
      I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER CONS...IF YOU'RE ON A BUDGET AND WANT A DUAL SIM PHONE WITHOUT ANY FRILLS THEN THIS IS PERFECT FOR YOU. IF YOU'RE THE TYPE OF CONSUMER WHO HATES A LAGGING OS AND WANTS MORE....MOVE ON...
      
      
      EDIT: ALSO FORGOT TO ADD THE PHONE DOESN'T HAVE A LIGHT SENSOR SO AUTO BRIGHTNESS ISN'T AVAILABLE THOUGH IT DOES HAVE A PROXIMITY SENSOR WHICH MEANS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ON THE PHONE IT AUTOMATICALLY DISABLES THE SCREEN SO THAT PARTS OF YOUR FACE DON'T RUB AGAINST IT AND MAKE YOU CHOOSE SOMETHING."

Galaxy S Duos,3,"BOUGHT THE PHONE 2 WEEKS BACK.....
      
      LOOKS QUITE GOOD.......EVERYTHING IS GOOD....BUT IT CAN'T HANDLE MUCH APPS ...
      
      I THINK PROBLEM IS IN THE HARDWARE THAT DOESN'T RESPONDS FASTER.......HELL LOT OF APPS CAN BE INSTALL BUT PHONE LOOSES ITS COMPUTATION POWER.......GETS SLOW......
      
      CALLING DIALLING  INTERFACE OPENS VERY SLOW.....
      
      IS NOT FOR THE GAMER NOT EVEN FOR THE POWER USER........"
Galaxy S Duos,3,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE TODAY FROM LOCAL MARKET IN 11900. BEFORE IT, I WAS USING HTC DESIRE C. NOW COME TO THE PHONE, MANY PEOPLE DESCRIBED IT'S SPECIFICATION AND FEATURES. SO I'M GOING TO THE FINAL WORDS. SAMSUNG MAKING GOOD CONFIGURATION ON IT'S ALL HANDSET, BUT THE QUALITY IS SO MUCH CHEAP ON THIS BUDGET. THE HEADPHONE SOUND QUALITY IS LIKE NOKIA 101. THE BACK COVER IS SIMILAR TO THE CHINESE PHONES. INTERNET IS SPEED ALSO VERY POOR IN 2G CONNECTION COMPARED TO MY HTC DESIRE C. SAMSUNG NEEDS TO WORK ON THE HANDSET BULID QUIALITY AND IT'S ACCESSORIES TOO. I'M GOING TO MISS MY HTC AND BEATS AUDIO...."
Galaxy S Duos,3,BUY THIS ONLY IF DUAL SIM IS A MUST... OTHERWISE GALAXY S ADVANCE IS A FAR BETTER CHOISE. PERFOMANCE VISE S ADVANCE IS A LION IF S DUOS IS A CUTE POMERANIAN DOG...:) PRICE DIFFERENCE IS LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND ONLY....
Galaxy S Duos,3,"DEAR ALL,
      
      
      I WANT EVERY PURCHASER OF THIS MOBILE TO TEST THIS SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITY ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      BEING A DUAL SIM PHONE, YOU CAN INSERT BOTH THE SIM CARDS.
      
      
      1. START YOUR DATA NETWORK ON SIM 2 AND TRY CALLING YOUR SIM 1. YOU WILL GET A MESSAGE : THIS MOBILE NUMBER IS SWITCHED OFF. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.
      
      
      2. IF YOU HAVE ACTIVATED SMART DUAL SIM FEATURE AND FOLLOW THE SAME PROCEDURE THEN YOUR CALL ON SIM 1 WILL BE DIVERTED TO SIM 2 AS A FORWARD CALL. IN THIS CASE, YOUR SIM 1 OPERATOR WILL CHARGE YOU FOR EVERY FORWARD CALL.
      
      
      3. IF YOU CALL SIM 2 NUMBER WHERE YOU ARE USING DATA NETWORK THEN THERE IS NO ISSUE AND THE PHONE WILL BE RINGING FOR SIM 2.
      
      
      THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN WITH DUAL SIM PHONE AS BY DEFAULT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ACTIVE AT ANY POINT OF TIME.
      
      
      PLEASE LET ME KNOW YOUR CONCLUSIONS.
      
      
      THANKS,

Galaxy S Duos,3,"HELLO EVERYONE,
      
      I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW ON THE SAMSUNG S DUOS PHONE. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FRO LAST 2 WEEKS. AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE READING THIS REVIEW ARE KEEN ON KNOWING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE , EVEN I WAS ONE OF THEM 2 WEEKS AGO. I CAN UNDERSTAND IT IS YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY U R GOING TO INVEST ON THIS PHONE.SO I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE U A FULL-ON REVIEW OF THE PHONE... LOOK WISE..THE PHONE IS AWESOME.. ME AND MANY OF MY FRNDS WERE SURPRISED TO SEE CHOTA S3 ON MY HAND.. THE BUILD OF THE PHONE IS NICE.. OF-COURSE THE PLASTIC IS A BIT CHEAPER.. BUT IT IS NOT HURTING THE STANDARD OF THE PHONE.
      
      
      THE BATTERY BACK UP LIKE OTHER ANDRIOD PHONES IS ONLY FOR ONE DAY. CHARGING OF THE PHONE IS SUPERB. IT TAKES LESS TIME.
      
      
      NOW LET ME BRIEF YOU THE SOFTWARE BUILD AND STUFF. THE PHONE UI IS AWESOME. TOUCH IS NICE. THE PHONE FEATURES ARE OK. BUT THERE IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE PHONE. IF U KEEP THE POWER SAVING MODE ON THE PHONE HAS LOTS OF LAGS EVEN WHILE ACCESSING THE CONTACTS . THIS LAG IS SERIOUSLY VERY IRRITATION. SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN WE GET CALLS IT ONLY VIBRATES WITH A BLANK SCREEN.
      
      
      ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE IS THAT THE PHONE INTERNAL MEMORY IS ONLY 2GB AND ALL THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE INSTALLED IN IT. WE CANNOT MOVE THE APPS TO SD CARD. THERE IS NO OPTION TO MOVE TO SD CARD. EVEN I TRIED INSTALLING APPS TO MOVE ,BUT AINT WORKING. THIS IS THE MAJOR CONCERN HERE. BECAUSE WHEN I INSTALLED FB IN MY PHONE. THE PHONE WAS GETTING STUCK AND I HAD NO OTHER OPTION THEN UNINSTALLING THE FB APP.
      
      
      THERE IS ALSO ISSUE IN THE NETWORK. THE CLARITY WHILE ON CALL IS ALSO BAD. IF WE MAKE A CALL. WE CANNOT HEAR PROPERLY AND WHEN WE RECEIVE A CALL THERE IS LOT OF DISTURBANCE. THIS ISSUE WAS SEEN WHEN I HAD FULL NETWORK RANGE.
      
      
      WHILE USING FAMOUS APPS LIKE FB,TEMPLE RUN AND SUBWAY SURF ,THE PHONE GETS STUCK. THE PROCESSOR IS MAIN CONCERN HERE.
      
      
      EVEN THE SWYPE TEXTING SOFTWARE IS NOT PREINSTALLED. THE DUAL ACTIVE SIM THERE IS ERROR SHOWN THAT CALL FORWARDING FACILITY IS ALWAYS FAILING.
      
      
      OVERALL THIS IS A AVERAGE PHONE AND THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR BEST SMARTPHONE, I WOULD SAY.. HAVE A RETHINK ON IT. I WOULD RATE 5 OUT OF 10 FOR THIS PHONE.
      
      
      THANK YOU

Galaxy S Duos,3,"HI FRIENDS,
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 4TH NOV 2012. HERE IS MY FEED BACK.
      
      
      NEGATIVE:
      
      
      1. IF YOU ARE USING INTERNET IN SIM1 AND SOMEONE CALLS YOU ON SIM2 THEN CALL WILL BE FORWARDED CALL. CALL FORWARDING CHARGES WILL BE APPLIED AS PER YOU CURRENT NETWORK.
      
      2. IT WORKS ON CALL FORWARDING SYSTEM NOT A PURELY DUAL ACTIVE STANDBY.
      
      3. WHEN YOU CALL ANY NUMBER FROM CONTACTS THEN NO OPTION IS THERE TO SELECT SIM CARD, THROUGH WHICH YOU WANT TO MAKE A CALL. BY DEFAULT SELECTED SIM WILL SHOOT A CALL.
      
      4. PHONE IS RALLY A SLOW WHEN USE CAMERA FUNCTIONS. SWITCHING FROM CAMERA TO GALLERY IS VERY SLOW.
      
      5. BATTERY ALMOST COVER ONLY 6 HRS, IF WE USE IT LIKE AN ANDROID.
      
      6. PHONE IS BIT SLOW AS GALAXY SERIES...
      
      
      POSITIVE:
      
      
      1. EXCELLENT CAMERA QUALITY. 5 MP WITH LED FLASH. ONE THING MORE AUTO FOCUSING IS NOT THERE.
      
      2. GRAPHIC ARE VERY GOOD.
      
      3. IN BUILD TASK MANAGER WHICH IS REALLY GOOD.
      
      4. BUY BLACK COLOR BECAUSE IT'S LOOK IS AMAZING IN BLACK.
      
      5. IN BUILT FONT STYLES.
      
      6. 4 GB INTERNAL WHICH IS ANOTHER + POINT."
Galaxy S Duos,3,"HI FRIENDS,
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE AROUND 1 MONTH BACK ITS A GOOD LOOKING PHONE WITH DUAL SIM FEATURE, BUT PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE IS SLOW PROCESSING ONCE YOU INSTALL ANY APP FROM ANDROID MARKET IT WILL GO SLOW AND EVERY TIME YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE BACKGROUND PROCESS TO SPEED UP THE PHONE APART FROM SLOW PROCESSING EVERY THING IS GOOD ."
Galaxy S Duos,3,"HI GUYS,

Galaxy S Duos,3,I BOUGHT A PHONE TWO WEEKS BACK.USING INTERNET PHONE GETS HANG.CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD. I WILL NOT RECOMEND . TO BUY THIS.   IT IS  WASTE OF  MONEY .              IT IS  CHEAP IN PERFORMANCE AND      HIGH PRIZE
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I BOUGHT IT AT THE PRICE OF 15K, SO I FEEL COULD HAVE  BOUGHT SOMETHING BETTER. THE CURRENT PRICE IS,HOWEVER, WORTH THE PHONE.  THE PHN IS OVERALL GOOD, NYC TOUCHSCREEN. A FEW CONS:
      
      1. EAR PHONES ARENT IMPRESSIVE. MIC OF THE EARPHONE DOES NOT RESIST BACKGROUND NOISE AT ALL.
      
      2. APPS CANT B MOVED TO SD CARD
      
      3. THE BACK PANEL GETS SCRATCHED EASILY
      
      4. AVERAGE AT MULTI TASKING. HANGS WHEN RUNNING 2 HEAVY APPS TOGETHER.. LIK GAMES
      
      WHILE PLAYIN FRUIT NINJA I NOTICED DAT SMTYMS D SCREEN BECOMES IRRESPONSIVE IN BETWEEN IF INC
      
      ASE THERE IS A SMS COMING IN.
      
      5. PRETTY DISSATISFIED WD THE EARPIECE.... ITS LOUD BUT LAGS IN CLARITY.
      
      6. IT IS DUAL ACTIVE ACC TO SPECIFICATIONS... BUT I STILL FIND ONE OF  THE SIM CANT RECIEVE CALLS WHILE D ODR IS RUNNING IBTERNET. SO THE DUAL ACTIVE FEATURE DSNT REALLY WORK WELL .
      
      PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINEF ABOUT BATTTERY, BUT I FEEL ITS NIT AS BAD. ITS UPON HOW YOU USE IT. CHARGING PHONE TO FULL ONCE A DAY,IN ONE GO, WOULD GIV GREAT PERFORMANCE ."
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I BOUGHT IT FOR MY FRIEND AND I USED FOR FEW WEEK SO PERSONALLY TELLING NEED NOT TO SPEND DOUBLE AMOUNT BECAUSE MICROMAX A110 IS VERY GOOD COMPARE TO THIS..
      
      
      IF ANYONE IS THINKING OF BUYING THIS PHONE PLZ
      
      DONT BUY.AT A PRICE OF 17K ITS NOT WORTH IT
      
      HANGS WHEN PLAYING BIG GAMES EVEN TEMPLE RUN,
      
      TO ALL MY DEAR FRIENDS I WOULD SUGGEST
      
      YOU TO MICROMAX A110....
      
      
      DONT GO ON BRAND AS FIRST YOU ALL MUST BE
      
      KNOWING THAT NOKIA WAS AT TOP, NOW SAMSUNG
      
      AND TOMORROW IT MAY BE OUR INDIAN COMAPNIES
      
      LIKE MICROMAXX OR KARBONN"
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I BOUGHT THE PHONE 10 DAYS BACK. I THINK THERE IS NO POINT OF DISCUSSING THE POSITIVES AS THEY ARE POSITIVES.
      
      
      THE NEGATIVES THAT I HAVE OBSERVED IN THESE 10 DAYS ARE:
      
      
      1) BATTERY BACK UP IS VERY LOW. IF WE USE THE PHONE CONTINUOUSLY WITH EITHER BROWSING OR LISTENING TO SONGS BATTERY WILL LAST ONLY FOR SOME 5 HOURS
      
      2) AS THESE POEPLE ADVERTISE INTERNAL MEMEORY IS NOT 4GB IT COMES ONLY 1.78GB AND I HAVE QUESTIONED SAMSUNG FOR THE SAME AND THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT 2 GB IS BEING USED FOR ANDROID OS PURPOSE AND IT IS RESERVED, NOT FOR USAGE PURPOSE.
      
      3)MUSIC PLAYER IS A BIG PROBLEM. THE SONG GETS PAUSED IN BETWEEN FOR 1-2SECS AND AGAIN PLAYS AUTOMATICALLY THAT MEANS IT LAGS. I HAVE TRIED INSTALLING THIRD PARTY MUSIC PLAYER BUT STILL ISSUE IS THE SAME. I AM NOT SURE BUT I THINK IF WE CAN USE CLASS 10 MEMORY CARD THIS MIGHT OVERCOME BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE WRITING AND READING SPEED OF THE PHONE TOO.
      
      4) IF YOU PEOPLE ARE THINKING WHETHER TO BUY S DUOS OR S ADVANCE THEN YOU GO FOR S ADVANCE, IT IS THE RIGHT CHOICE OF JUS 2.5K EXTRA BUGS.
      
      5)PEOPLE WHO LOVES GAMING DO NOT THINK OF BUYING THIS PHONE"
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE ON 15TH JAN THROUGH FLIPKART...THE PACKING AND DELIVERY METHOD OF FLIPKART IS SIMPLY AWESOME...
      
      THE MOBILE IS ACTUALLY GOOD ONE...BIG SCREEN,NICE DESIGN,GOOD CAMERA CLARITY...
      
      BUT THE MOBILE LACKS IN ITS SPEED...IT HAS 1GH PROCESSOR BUT ONLY SINGLE WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH FOR ULTIPLE TASKS AND ALSO FOR GAMES WHICH CONSUMES MORE PROCESSOR..AND ALSO CALLING OPTION IS TOO SLOW AND THE NAMES OF THE CONTACTS LOADS TOO SLOW WHEN YOU OPEN MESSAGING APPLICATION...I THINK IF THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN DUAL CORE THEN THIS MOBLE IS AWESOME..RAM AND ALL OK MANAGABLE..BUT ONE THING WHEN I ENQUIRED ABOUT THIS MOBILE IN SAMSUNG STORE THEY TOLD IN BUILT 4GB MEMORY IN THAT WE'LL GET 3GB ACCESSIBLE MEMORY...BUT THEY CHEATED..ONLY 1.78GB IS ACCESSIBLE..
      
      BUT IN MATTER OF PRICE CHEAP AND LOOKS SIMILAR TO SAMSUNG SMINI...

Galaxy S Duos,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 4 MONTHS BACK.. ALL FEATURES ARE SATISFACTORY.. ONE DRAWBACK IS THAT HD VIDEOS CANNOT BE PLAYED ON THE PHONE.. AND A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS PHONE IS THAT IT HUNGS VERY  OFTEN.. IT STARTED HANGING WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF USAGE.. AND IT IS VERY IRRITATING,,"
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY BABY SIS A MONTH BACK THINKING THAT IT HAD A 4GB INTERNAL MEMORY. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS: AFTER I BOUGHT THE PHONE I HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ABOUT THE INTERNAL MEMORY AND IT LED ME TO ONE CONCLUSION. THERE IS NO 4GB MEMORY. THE PHONE IS REALLY GOOD IN EVERY WAY, BUT IF UR REQUIREMENT IS AN INTERNAL MEMORY, I SUGGEST U LOOK ELSEWHERE."
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART IN JAN'13. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR THE PAST 3 MONTHS.
      
      FIRST OF ALL FLIPKART IS DOING EXCELLENT JOB. THUMBS UP FOR THEIR SERVICE.
      
      NOW LETS COME TO THE PHONE'S PART. I HAVE BEEN USING SAMSUNG MOBILE FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS AND SO I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME SAMSUNG SET ITSELF IN THIS PRICE RANGE. I EVEN RESEARCH ON SONY AND HTC AS WELL BUT AT LAST DECIDE TO GO WITH THIS.
      
      I WON'T SAY TOUCH IS BUTTER SMOOTH BUT IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN MANY OTHER BRANDS. CAMERA QUALITY IS AWESOME. SOUND IS GREAT, ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE IS THE PROCESSOR, IT HAS A SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR SO WE CAN'T PLAY HEAVY GAMES ON THIS PHONE.
      
      OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS A GREAT BUY AT THIS PRICE RANGE."
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I HAVE BEEN ""XPERIA ARC S"" OVER THE PAST 8 MONTHS. EVEN THOUGH ARC HAS A HIGHER PROCESSOR SPEED {1.4GHZ} COMPARED TO GALAXY DUOS {1GHZ}, A SLIGHTLY LARGER SCREEN 4.2"" COMPARED TO DUOS 4"", AND A HIGHER RESOLUTION CAMERA 8MP COMPARED TO DUOS 5MP, ITS THE BATTERY BACK UP PROBLEM THAT IRRITATED ME A LOT, LASTED ONLY 18 HRS.
      
      
      PROS::
      
      1. THE BATTERY BACK UP IN GALAXY S DUOS IS VERY GOOD LASTING FOR AROUND 2 DAYS ON NORMAL USAGE. WITH ITS DUAL SIM ADVANTAGE AND A SECONDARY CAMERA, 768 MB RAM, DECENT ENOUGH INTERNAL MEMORY, SMOOTH USER INTERFACE AND ICS ALREADY PRE-LOADED, ITS THE BEST BARGAIN.
      
      HOWEVER, AS WITH EVERY PHONE THIS HAS ITS CONS TOO
      
      
      CONS::
      
      1. THE OVERALL DESIGN AND TEXTURE OF THE HANDSET IS BAD. IT FEELS VERY AWKWARD WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING IT.
      
      2. THE SCREEN DOES NOT COME WITH ANY KIND OF PROTECTION.SO ITS BETTER TO GET A MATTE SCREEN FIXED RIGHT AWAY, FOR PROTECTION AND A SMOOTHER USER EXPERIENCE.
      
      3. NO SD CARD GIVEN IN THE PACKAGE!!( HOW COME SAMSUNG PROVIDED A 2 GB CARD FOR SAMSUNG SY8360 BUT NO SD CARD FOR THIS PHONE??)
      
      4. EVERYTIME THE SIGNAL RECEPTION DECREASES DURING A CALL, THE PERSON'S VOICE ON THE CALL SUDDENLY CHANGES INTO AN IRRITATING TONE, SOMETHING SIMILAR TO A SONG SUDDENLY PLAYED ON VERY LOW TEMPO.
      
      5. NO HD RECORDING, AND NO PLAYBACK OF HD VIDEOS.
      
      6. NO DUAL CORE PROCESSOR"
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING S DUOS FOR PAST 2 MONTHS.
      
      THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH DUAL SIM ACTIVE PROPERTY OF THIS PHONE. I CANNOT RECEIVE INCOMING CALLS ON 1 SIM CARD WHEN DATA IS ACTIVE ON ANOTHER SIM CARD.
      
      INSPITE OF APPLYING ALL NECESSARY SETTINGS IN SIM CARD MANAGER IN THIS PHONE THIS PROBLEM IN OCCURING.
      
      AS SAMSUNG HAS DECLARED THIS PHONE AS DUAL SIM ACTIVE PHONE, IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE AND SEND CALLS &AMP; DATA FROM BOTH THE SIM CARDS IN ACIVE CONDITION, OTHERWISE THERE IS NO POINT IN INVESTING 16.5 K FOR A SMART DUAL SIM PHONE WHERE THE DUAL SIM PROPERTY IS NOT GETTING SATISFIED.
      
      GUYS PLEASE CHECK THIS FEATURE BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS PHONE.
      
      REST THE PHONE IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR USE WITH ITS LOOKS ALMOST SIMILAR TO GALAXY S III.
      
      
      IF ANYONE COMES UP WITH SAME PROBLEM AS ABOVE KINDLY LET ME KNOW YOUR SOLUTION."
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST TWO WEEKS. I WOULD SAY THAT THIS PHONE IS GOOD IF YOU USE ONLY THE BASIC FEATURES. ITS IS A BAD BUY IF YOU ARE A GAMER AND WOULD LIKE TO USE LOT OF APPLICATIONS ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      THERE IS ALREADY A LAG WHEN BASIC FUNCTIONS LIKE CONTACTS, CALENDAR."
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS SMARTPHONE FROM PAST 4 MONTHS.  IT IS A DECENT PERFORMER. IT HAS ANDROID ICS AND 768MB OF RAM ALONG WITH 4 INCH DISPLAY SCREEN. OVERALL I FELT IT IS OK PHONE. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING TO BUY THIS PHONE, PLEASE KNOW BELOW POINTS.
      
      1. IT IS NOT A POWERFUL GAMING PHONE. IT FAILS PLAY GAMES SMOOTHLY SUCH AS TEMPLE RUN. I AM NOT SAYING YOU CANNOT PLAY. BUT IS NOT VERY SMOOTH.
      
      2. TOUCH RESPONSE IS JUST AVERAGE. YOU CAN FEEL IT WHILE YOU PLAY FRUIT NINJA GAME AS WILL AS ON TEMPLE RUNS.
      
      3. ONLY VGA VIDEO RECORDING ABILITY.
      
      
      AS PER SAMSUNG, THIS PHONE IS GOING TO GET JELLY BEAN UPDATE. I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO WAIT FOR SOME TIME AS THIS IS NOT VERY GREAT PHONE FOR THE PRICE."
Galaxy S Duos,3,"I PURCHASED THE MOBILE FROM MARKET. THE REVIEW OF THE MOBILE:

      2. GOOD BUT NOT THE EXCELLENT

Galaxy S Duos,3,"I'M USING THIS PHONE FROM A WEEK, AND MY REVIEW IS BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      BATTERY BACKUP:
      
      NOT BAD, SHOULD LAST FOR 2 TO 3 DAYS FOR A MODERATE USER.
      
      
      SCREEN QUALITY:
      
      AWESOME, JUST AWESOME
      
      
      PERFORMANCE:
      
      I DINT FEEL LIKE INSTALLING ANY HIGH END GAMES AFTER USING THIS. I KNOW IT WILL HANG. IT IS TAKING SOME TIME TO LOAD CONTACTS AND OTHER BASIC APPLICATIONS ONLY.
      
      
      SW:
      
      NO JELLY BEAN UPDATE. :("
Galaxy S Duos,3,"IN A SINGLE WORD GALAXY S DUOS IS A  GOOD BUDGET SMARTPHONE. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT DEVICE FOR NORMAL USAGE LIKE MAIL, WHATSAPP AND OTHER BASIC PHONE FEATURES. IF ANYONE WANT SOMETHING MORE THEN BUY HTC DESIRE V INSTEAD OF GALAXY S DUOS."
Galaxy S Duos,3,ITS A GU PHONE WITH LATEST ANDROID FEATURES...EITH THE LEADING BRAND..AND GREAT CAMARA QUALITY.WITH DUAL SIM STAND BY YOU DONT NEED TO CARRY TWO MOBILES.YOU JUST HAVE ONE WORKED FOR TWO.BUY IT USE IT AND REVIEW HERE ON FLIPKART

      4"" SCREEN (REALLY GOOD)
      
      DUAL SIM
      
      ICS 4.0
      
      DUAL CAMERA WITH 5 MP REAR CAMERA (TAKES DECENT SNAP SHOTS)

      CONS:
      
      SLUGGISH HARDWARE. RESPONSE IS REAL SLOW.
      
      UNWANTED APPS WITH SAMSUNG PHONES.
      
      RAM IS ABOUT 648 MB, BUT ANY GIVEN POINT OF TIME, NOT MORE THAN 200 MB AVAILABLE
      
      SINGLE CORE 1 GHZ PROCESSOR
      
      
      MY RECOMMENDATION:
      
      BUY THE PHONE IF YOU WANT A LARGE SCREEN WITH DUAL CAMERA &AMP; DUAL SIM
      
      DON'T BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES AND STUFF
      
      BUY IT IF YOU PLAN TO ROOT IT AND REMOVE MOST OF THE STOCK APPS!

Galaxy S Duos,3,"SWITCHED TO MY FIRST ANDROID DEVICE AFTER A DECADE OF USING WINDOWS MOBILES (IMATE AND HTC). HAD GIVEN UP ON TOUCHSCREEN PHONES BUT THIS PHONE RESTORED MY FAITH.

DITTO WHEN I TRIED UNINSTALLING KIES. THE ONLINE MANUAL WASN'T MUCH HELP EITHER. WHEN I POSTED THIS AT THE SAMSUNG SITE, I GOT A REPLY STATING MY POST WAS UN-PUBLISHABLE AS IT VIOLATED THEIR NORMS.

Galaxy S Duos,3,"THIS IS AN AUSUMN PHONE.. WHEN I SAY AUSUMN, I MEAN IN THIS PRICE RANGE.
      
      FOR 13K WHAT DO WE GET- JUST COUNT IT -

      -- GREAT LOOKS

      IF WE LOOK ONLY AT THE ABOVE MENTIONED FEATURES AND KEEP IN MIND ITS PRICE, THEN THIS PRODUCT DESERVES A 5 STAR
      
      THE THINGS PULLING IT DOWN ARE-
      
      --ITS PRPOCESSOR- 1GHZ SINGLE CORE CORTEX A5 - IT IS A VERY OLD GENERATION PROCESSOR, AND BELEIVE ME THIS PHONE LAGS A LOT WHILE USING 2-3 APPS AT A TIME

      XPERIA U DOES NOT LAG IN SPEED AND PERFORMANCE. BUT SAMSUNG GALAXY S IS VERY SLOW IN PERFORMANCE. THE REASON FOR BUYING A SMART PHONE IS TO USE APPS AND GAMES AND FAST PERFORMANCE.
      
      IF U R VERY MUCH CONCERNED ONLY ABOUT THE DISPLAY SIZE AND NOT DISPLAY QUALITY AND LOOK OF A S3 THEN GO FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUO. IF U R LOOKING FOR PHONE WITH GOOD PERFORMANCE AND CRYSTAL CLEAR DISPLAY THEN GO FOR XPERIA U."

( SOMETIME ,I WAS ALSO NOT ABLE TO MAKE CALLS SO NEED TO DAIL MULTIPLE TIMES)
      
      
      2 . ANOTHER POINT IS BATTERY BACK UP AS OF 1500 MHZ CAPACITY IS AVAILBALE BUT DO NOT SERVE THAT MUCH BACK UP ... BATTEY WENT DOWN ,IF USING INTERNET AND MUSIC FOR 2 OR 3 HOURS AND GOT HEAT UP WHILE USING CONTINOUSLY .
      
      
      3. AS WE TALK ABOUT PRICE OF THIS ICS DUAL PHONE IS MUCH GOOD BUT DO NOT SERVE ALL THE FACILITY AS PROVIDED .
      
      
      SOME BASIC FACTS --- LOOK IS VERY NICE , TOUCH IS GOOD , MUSIC AND CAMERA IS VERY GOOD WITH SEOCONDRY CAM OPTION ..

      I WILL SUGGEST THAT IF POSSIBLE THEN DO NOT GO FOR S DUOS ... IN LOTS OF DEVICES WE ALL ARE HAVING SOME COMMAN ISSUE ... THAT IS SURE . SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN SAMSUNG S DUOS ....
      
      
      FOR ME SAMSUNG S DUOS 7562 IS NOT IN MA WISH LIST !!!"
Galaxy S Duos,2,HI ALL.. I HAVE BOUGHT THIS FON 3 MONTHS BACK... AT TIMES IT WILL MAKE U GO MAD.. U CANT MOVE UR APPS TO SD-CARD SO OBVIOSULY YOUR FON WILL BE DAM SLOW.... AT TIMES IT WONT EVEN RESPOND.. VOICE CLARITY IS ALSO NO THT GOOD... BUT IF U SEE THE SPECS U WILL THINK THE FON IS JUST AWESOME.. BUT BE CAREFUL IF U R GOONA CHOOSE THIS FON......
Galaxy S Duos,2,"HI I HAVE BOUGH THIS MOBILE WHEN IT WAS REDUCED TO 15K IN JAN 19TH OF THIS YEAR. IMMEDIATELY AFTER 20 DAYS THEY HAVE REDUCED TO 13K. NOW 12K. I THINK THIS IS THE BEST BUY(I THINK THIS IS THE ORGINIAL PRICE OF THIS MOBILE).
      
      
      PEOPLE LIKE ME CURSE SAMSUNG. IN MY 3 MONTHS USAGE I FOUND THAT IT IS FALLS UNDER BASIC SMART PHONE WITH FRONT CAMERA. IT IS NOT EVEN IN FALLING IN MIDDLE RANGE REQUIREMENT. IT CAN PLAY ONLY SMALL GAMES WITH LESS RESOLUTION.
      
      
      THE ISSUES I FOUND ARE
      
      1 AUTOMATIC RESTART
      
      2 HANG UP
      
      3 SOUND QUALITY VERY POOR
      
      4 UI DOESN'T RESPOND WELL(SCREEN ROTATION)
      
      5 WIFI PROBLEM(NOW I AM GOING TO GIVE TO SERVICE CENTER)
      
      6 DUAL SIM HAVING PROBLEMS(IF ONE OF THE SIM IS NOT HAVING SIGNAL MAKES OTHER SIM OR EVEN MOBILE RESTART)
      
      
      SO MY ADVICE IS TO GO WITH QUALITY NOT WITH RATE DISCOUNT. PROBABLY WAIT FOR ONE MORE MONTH IT MIGHT COME FOR 10K"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I AM NOT SURE OF ALL THE REVIEWS HERE BUT MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS THAT THIS PHONE HAS GOT MANY PROBLEMS IE...I ORDERED THIS PHONE VIA FLIPKART AND I FACED BELOW PROBLEMS AND THEY HAVE REPLACED IT IMMEDIATELY BUT EVEN THE REPLACED PHONE HAS ALSO  GOT THE SAME PROBLEMS ..
      
      1.VERY LOW INCOMING/OUTGOING CALL VOLUME ,YOU CANNOT HEAR WHAT OTHER PERSON SAYS IF YOU ARE IN TRAFFIC ,EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT IN TRAFFIC ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR. THIS IS NOT A SIGNAL PROBLEM I TESTED WITH DIFFERENT SIMS
      
      2.LOT OF DISTURBANCE IN THE PHONE AND VOICE SHUTTERS A LOT ,YOU WONT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHER PERSON SAYS.
      
      3.MUSIC STOPS IN BETWEEN FOR 1-2 SECONDS AND THEN CONTINUES
      
      4.THE SECOND SIM IS NOT REACHABLE/SWITCHED OFF.
      
      5.SOMETIMES THE OTHER PERSON WONT BE ABLE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AT ALL.
      
      
      PROS
      
      -----
      
      1.EXCELLENT CAMERA 5MP IS TOO GOOD.
      
      2.MUSIC QUALITY IS GOOD
      
      3.4 INCH SCREEN DISPLAY IS AWSOME AND TFT SCREEN IS EXCELLENT
      
      4.MANY CUSTOMIZATIONS CAN BE DONE TO HOME SCREEN.
      
      
      HOWEVER IF THE PHONE DOESNT MEET THE BASIC NEEDS ,ITS WASTE OF MONEY"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I AM USING SAMSUNG S DUOS FOR LAST 2 MONTHS AND WENT TO SERVICE STATION TWICE ALREADY.
      
      
      I WILL NOT TELL THE GOOD POINTS AS MOST WOULD HAVE SAID MANY TIMES.
      
      
      CONS
      
      1. BATTERY IS JUST TOO WEAK. NOT LASTING A DAY OF NORMAL USAGE. MAY BE ANDRIOD.
      
      2. 3G SPEED IS PATHETIC. MY GALAXY Y HAD BETTER SPEED UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS.
      
      3. TO SLOW IN RESPONSE. UI IS SMOOTH FOR NORMAL OPERATIONS, BUT NEVER TRY THE UI INTERFACE FOR GAMES. GAMES TAKES AGES TO JUST START. EVEN OTHER REPSONSES ARE NOT THAT GREAT.
      
      4. YOU NEED TO ALWAYS KEEP DELETING RAM MEMORY. 768MB IN TODAYS WORLD JUST NOT SUFFICE.
      
      
      I GIVE 2 STARS FOR BRAND NAME AND DESIGN. NEGATIVE 3 STARS FOR OTHERS."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE A MONTH BEFORE IT LACKS  IN EVERY  WORK  GOOGLE CHROME IS NOT  PROPERLY WORKING ON  THIS PHONE
      
      POOR PERFORMANCE  IN  HD  GAMES
      
      CAMERA IS NOT AT ALL  AN SATISFACTORY FOR ME
      
      SOUND IS TOOO LOW I CAN'T EVEN KEEP  IT IN A HARD CASE COVER
      
      
      FINALLY I GAVE  IT TO  MY  BACKWARD  COUSIN. HE'S  HAPPY
      
      NOW I BOUGHT AN  MICROMAX. A90 AND BOY ITS QUITE  BETTER !"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR 3 REASONS
      
      1. LOW PRICE FOR THE FEATURES
      
      2. EXCELLENT SCREEN
      
      3. DUAL SIM
      
      
      BUT THIS IS NOT A GOOD PHONE FOR REGULAR USERS (AM NOT A BIG FAN OF SAMSUNG AS WELL!!!) WHO WANTS A SMART PHONE TO USE YOUR THEIR WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK, TWITTER OR THE LARGE LIST OF ANDROID APPS,
      
      DRAW BACK OF THIS PRODUCT :
      
      1. SLOW - MAYBE THE LOW RAM AND HEAVY ANDROID OS
      
      2. SAMSUNG APPS - I SEE THAT THERE ARE ANONYMOUS DOWNLOADS HAPPENING, WHICH LOOKS LIKE SOME OS UPDATE (SAYS SAMSUNG UPDATE) WHICH I CANNOT STOP - ENDS UP GIVING ME LARGE PHONE BILL. MY EARLIER HTC WILDFIRE NEVER USED SO MUCH ON DATA CONNECTION - AM NOT SURE IF THERE IS ANY VIRUS AT ALL.
      
      3. DUAL SIM FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY - MAY BE THERE NEEDS TO MORE GETTING USED TO
      
      4. CANNOT INSTALL TOO MANY APPS - I AS OF NOW HAVE NO ADDITIONAL APPS INSTALLED, HOPING THAT MAKES THE PHONE RESPOND FASTER"
Galaxy S Duos,2,I BOUGHT THIS PHONE.. USED FOR A FEW DAYS. THEN SOLD IT TO MY FRIEND BECAUSE OF ITS WORST MUSIC PLAYER... YOU WILL BE FACING SOME CRACK WHILE PLAYING A MUSIC TRACK. YOU HAVE TO GO FOR A THIRD PARTY MUSIC PLAYER THEN THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE OKAY NOT GOOD AT ALL. AFTER PAYING 17K WE WILL NOT BE SATISFIED YOU WILL BE FACING SOME OCCASIONAL LAGS TOO WHILE PLAYING A GAME LIKE TEMPLE RUN.. MY SUGGESTION DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BY CHOOSING THIS MODEL... BETTER GO FOR ANY XPERIA MODEL .. EVEN XPERIA TIPO IS BETTER PERFORMER THAN THIS MODEL. ONLY YOU HAVE TO COMPRISE WITH THE CAMERA.. WHO WILL DO PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY WITH MOBILE CAMERA.. REST DEPENDS ON YOU...BEST OF LUCK
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FROM FLIPCART ON 8 JAN 2013.
      
      I WAS EXCITED BY SEEING THE LOOK AND FEEL AND FEATURES THROUGH ADVT. I WAS ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS WILL BE A GOOD MOBILE IN THIS COST.
      
      BUT MOBILE PERFORMANCE IS VERY POOR IN ITS SPEED. IT HAS 1GH PROCESSOR BUT ONLY SINGLE WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH FOR MULTIPLE TASKS. CALLING OPTION IS TOO SLOW AND THE NAMES OF THE CONTACTS LOADS TOO SLOW WHEN YOU OPEN.
      
      NO HD PLAYBACK EVEN AFTER TRYING WITH DIFFERENT PLAYERS.
      
      WE CANNOT INSTALL APPS ON SD CARD. VERY SLOW GRAPHICS. RUNNING BASIC APPS WILL CONSUME ALL THE RAM &AMP; THE MOBILE WILL START HANGING. BROWSING ALSO SLOW WHEN USING MULTIPLE TABS.
      
      FED UP BY ALWAYS CLEARING RAM BY GOING TO TASK MANAGER.
      
      MOBILE COMPLETELY HANGS WHILE USING MULTIPLE APPS.
      
      INSTALLING MORE APPS WILL REDUCES THE SPEED OF MOBILE.
      
      SO GUYS... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD PERFORMANCE MOBILE."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TWO MONTHS BEFORE. ITS PRICE IS AFFORDABLE, LOOKING VERY CUTE. BUT NO HD RECORDING AND HD VIDEO PLAYBACK. 3G SERVICE IS NOT SATISFACTORY. YOU CAN'T CALL THIS PHONE FULLY 3G. BATERY BACK-UP IS POOR"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I BROUGHT THIS PHONE IN OCTOBER AND I AM USING THIS SINCE THEN MY REVIEW FOR THIS PHONE IS THAT-  ITS POOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IN A NICE LOOKING CASE
      
      GOOD THING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS ITS LOOKS-- NICE LOOK AND FEEL
      
      TOUCH-- BUTTERY SMOOTH GOOD INTERFACE
      
      REST ALL THINGS IN THIS PHONE IS BAKWAAS..
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY IS ONLY 2 GB YOU CAN NOT INSTALL APPLICATIONS TO MICRO SD CARD,
      
      PHONE HANGS A LOT, ITS VERY SLOW, EVEN PHONE BOOK AND CONTACTS OPEN VERY SLOWLY
      
      MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAIN WITH MUSIC PLAYER, IT SKIPS AND PLAY
      
      I SUBMITTED MY PHONE TO SERVICE CENTER REGARDING MUSIC PLAYER ISSUE THEY RETURNED ME AFTER 7 DAYS WITHOUT SOLVING THE PROBLEM. AGAIN I SUBMITTED MY PHONE AND FOR THE LAST 10 DAYS ITS IN SERVICE CENTER, INITIALLY THEY SAID THEY WILL CHANGE MY PHONE'S MOTHERBOARD BUT NOW THEY ARE SAYING ITS NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. I COMPLAINED TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER AND THEIR HIGHER AUTHORITY. YESTERADAY SOME GUYS FROM SAMSUNG CALLED ME AND SAID THEY WILL EITHER REFUND MY MONEY OR REPLACE ME WITH A NEW PHONE BUT THEY ARE SAYING IT WILL TAKE AROUND 15 TO 20 DAYS. NOW YOU THINK GUYS MY PHONE IS FOR LAST ONE MONTH WITH THEM AND THEY ARE SAYING IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER 2 WEEKS.
      
      I DON'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MICROMAX OR ANY LOCAL PHONE AND A SAMSUNG PHONE REGARDING THEIR PRODUCT AND THEIR AFTER SALE SERVICE..."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE ANYBODY BUT IM SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THIS PHONE DOESN'T REVEAL THE WONDERS IT HAS PROMISED.
      
      I AGREE IT HAS GOT THE LATEST ANDROID JELLY BEAN 4.1 , BUT THE TOUCH ISNT TOO GOOD. FURTHERMORE SAMSUNG ARE SO DUMB THAT ON 1 GHZ PROCESSOR THEY HAVE LAUNCHED AN UPDATE OF JELLY BEAN.
      
      
      I TESTED THIS PHONE IN VARIOUS CATEGORIES ,, YOU CAN CHECK THOSE BELOW :-
      
      
      1. MULTITASKING -
      
      YES, THE MAIN FEATURE EVERYBODY WANTS IN THEIR PHONE. THIS PHONE CAN ONLY RUN UP TO 4  APPS (I OPENED G MAIL, G MAPS, FACEBOOK, HILL CLIMB RACING) WITH MEDIUM LAG. IF YOU OPEN MORE APPS THE PHONE BECOMES SLOW AND DULL, THAT'S A BIG DRAWBACK
      
      
      2. BATTERYLIFE-
      
      DONT BE TEMPTED BY THE INFO PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG THAT THE PHONE HAS A GOOD BATTERY LIFE.
      
      THE BATTERY GOT OUT OF ACTION AFTER 2 HOURS OF BROWSING. WITHIN FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES OF MULTI-TASKING THE BATTERY REACHED TO 73% FROM 100%. YOU CAN GET GLIMPSE THAT HOW THIS PHONE DRAINS THE BATTERY POWER. IF YOU ARE READY TO CHARGE THIS PHONE ATLEAST TWO TIMES A DAY, YOU MAY GO FOR IT.
      
      
      3.CAMERA -
      
      CAMERA  IS GOOD IN LIGHT OF WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF  A 5MP SENSOR.
      
      
      4. DISPLAY -
      
      DISPLAY ISNT TOO BRIGHT AND YOU WILL HAVE A HARD TIME READING IT SUNLIGHT. INDOORS IT IS FINE.
      
      TOUCH IS I WOULD SAY IS AVERAGE, NOTHING HOT SHOT THERE, IF YOU THINK IM WRONG, GO TO A MOB DEALER AND ASK HIM TO SHOW YOU THE TOUCH OF LUMIA 620. ITS TOUCH IS RIVAL TO S3 AND IPHONE."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I GOT THIS PHONE AS A GIFT. I WAS REALLY HAPPY. MY FIRST TIME WITH A 4INCH SCREEN AND ALL.
      
      BUT I WAS PROVED WRONG. THE SCREEN IS NORMAL LCD. THE PROCESSOR AND RAM SEEM GOOD ON PAPER BUT WHILE USING THE PHONE, THEY ARE NOT THAT POWERFUL.
      
      THIS PHONE HAS ANDROID 4.0.4, IT HAS GOOD BATTERY LIFE BUT THE PHONE LAGS. IT LAGS IN SETTINGS AND MANY OTHER PLACES.
      
      IT HANDLES VARIOUS GAMES, ONE IS ENTERTAINED BUT IF SOMEONE CALLS YOU IN BETWEEN PLAYING A GAME, THEN FOR 5 SECONDS SCREEN IS BLANK AND THEN YOU GET AN OPTION TO SEE WHO CALLED ETC ETC. THAT IS A BIG LIMITATION. THIS PHONE SHOULD BE PATCHED TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. SAMSUNG PEOPLE SHOULD TEST PHONE BEFORE LAUNCHING THEM.
      
      THE CAMERA IS DECENT BUT VIDEO RECORDING IS A DISMAL VGA.
      
      SO FOR 13100 YOU GET A MIXED DEAL.
      
      I WOULD SAY, AVOID THIS PHONE UNLESS YOU ALL PROBLEMS ARE FIXED. OTHERWISE, YOU WILL REPENT LIKE I DID."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I GOT THIS PRODUCT WITH DIFFICULTY. IT WAS DELIVERED BY FEDEX TO THE SHOP FEW BUILDING NEXT TO OUR HOUSE ADDRESS AS WE WERE NOT AT THE HOME ON DELIVERY DATE, THIS IS REALLY ANNOYING . AFTER INQUIRING WITH THE FEDEX OFFICE, WE COME TO KNOW ABOUT THIS AFTER FEW DAYS OF DELIVERY.
      
      THIS WAS A PANIC SITUATION, AS WE THOUGHT THAT WE MAY HAVE TO DO LOTS OF FOLLOWUPS TO GET THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      BUT AFTER INQUIRING WITH THE SHOP KEEPER WE GOT THE PRODUCT FINALLY.
      
      
      NOTE : FLIPKART NEED TO IMPROVE THIS DELIVERY SERVICE TO MAKE SURE THE RIGHT PERSON MUS GET THE PRODUCT."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE 1ST WEEK OF JANUARY. ISSUES THAT I FACED AND STILL FACING WOULD BE:
      
      
      1. KEEPS ON LAGGING WHILE MULTI-PROCESSING: GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN LAG TOO MUCH.
      
      2. FREQUENT RESTARTS - MOSTLY WHEN TRYING TO MAKE OR RECEIVE A CALL.
      
      3. VERY SLOW RESPONSE TIME - RESPONSE TO UR TOUCH LAGS AND CAN FRUSTRATE YOU AT TIMES
      
      
      I TOOK THIS PHONE TO SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER AT LEAST 7-8 TIMES NOW.
      
      FIRST THEY SAID , ONLY A SOFTWARE UPDATE IS REQUIRED ! - GOT THE SOFTWARE UPDATED 3 TIMES BUT NOTHING WORKED.
      
      FINALLY THE FOURTH TIME AROUND THEY REPLACED MY MOTHER BOARD, STILL THE PROBLEMS PERSIST. IN FACT THE PHONE HAS BECOME EVEN SLOWER. RESTARTS HAPPEN ONLY THRICE A DAY COMPARED TO SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE :(
      
      
      WORK-AROUND : I'M USING ONLY ONE SIM CARD &AMP; NOT TWO... THIS HAS MADE IT A LITTLE FASTER/ USABLE !
      
      
      GIVING 2 STARS COZ:
      
      1. FAIR SOUND QUALITY WHEN USED WITH STEREO HEAD SET
      
      2. GOOD CAMERA AT THIS PRICE RANGE"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS CELL. WHEN I RECEIVED, IT WAS OPEN AS THE MUNICIPAL PEOPLE HAVE OPENED THE PACKET FOR BILL FOR OCTRAI PAYMENT.
      
      LATER WHEN I CHECKED THE CELL I FOUND THAT IT HAS ONLY 2 GB INTERNAL MEMORY WHEREAS IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE WEBSITE THAT THE INTERNAL MEMORY OF THE CELL IS 4GB. REGARDING THE SAME I HAVE COMPLAINT TO THE CUSTOMER CARE, BUT SO FAR NO REPLY.
      
      IT WAS TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
      
      SO PLEASE CONFIRM BEFORE YOU BUY/PURCHASE.
      
      
      REGARDS
      
      MUSTAFA"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I HAVE LATELY SWITCHED FROM MY BLACKBERRY TO SAMSUNG S DUOS. AFTER USING IT FOR COUPLE OF DAYS, I REALIZED A MAJOR DRAWBACK IN THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING TO SWITCH FROM BLACKBERRY OR OTHER SMART PHONES - WHENEVER A CONTACT (STORED IN YOUR ADDRESS BOOK) IS CALLING YOU, THE COMPANY NAME DOES NOT DISPLAY. PEOPLE WHO HAVE MULTIPLE CONTACTS STORED BY SAME NAME OR USED COMPANY NAME AS A DIFFERENTIATING FACTOR TO IDENTIFY THEIR CALLERS WILL BE LEFT GUESSING?
      
      
      OTHERWISE PHONE IS GOOD."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I HAVE PURCHASED S DUOS FEW DAYS BACK........AND AFTER DOWNLOANDING FEW SMALL APPS ITS LAG A LOT AND SHOWING POOR PERFORMANCE BY CONTINOUS HANG A LOT...
      
      BUILT IN PROCESSOR IS TOO SLOW.......
      
      TAKES ATLEAST 10 SECONDS TO OPEN MSG BOX,CONTACTS ETC...
      
      BATTERY IS NOT SO GOOD....
      
      ANYWAYS SATISFIED WITH CAMERA PERFORMANCE AND SOUND QUALITY...
      
      AND MOST IMP THING THAT INTERNAL MEMORY WAS 1.78 GB NOT 4 GB...:("
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I HAVE THIS PHONE FOR A MONTH AND HALF NOW. IT IS A BAD PHONE. THE IDEA OF HAVING A ANDROID PHONE IS TO HAVE  APPS. AND AS SOON AS I START DOWNLOADING APPS THE PHONE GOT SLUGGISH. AS OF NOW I HAVE RESTART THE PHONE ATLEAST TWICE EVERY DAY. THE RAM IS ALWAYS USED UP TO 90%, EVERY HOUR I NEED TO CLEAN UP THE RAM BECAUSE JUST OPENING UP THE CONTACTS OR TO MAKE A CALL TAKES A MINUTE OR MORE. SOMETIMES I CANT EVEN PICK A CALL THAT IS INCOMING. I MISS MY BLACKBERRY CURVE. ALTHOUGHT THE CURVE NEVER PLAYED GAMES WELL, IT DID THE BASIC THINGS RIGHT AND THIS ONE MISSES THE POINT THERE.
      
      
      GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT IS THE SCREEN IT IS VERY GOOD AND THE APPS ON ANDROID ARE VERY GOOD."
Galaxy S Duos,2,I PURCHASED THIS PHONE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT A FEW MONTHS AGO. IT WAS SNAPPY FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS BUT GOT PROGRESSIVELY SLOWER. IT BECAME SO BAD (A ICON PRESS WOULD TAKE A FEW SECONDS TO REGISTER) THAT I DUMPED IT A WEEK OR SO AGO AND PICKED UP A MICROMAX A110 WHICH IS GETTING CONSISTENTLY GOOD REVIEWS AND I AM HAPPY WITH THAT PURCHASE. THE SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR OF THE S DUOS IS JUST NOT CUT OUT FOR ICS WITH THE SAMSUNG INTERFACE WORKING ON TOP OF IT. SAMSUNG JUST ANNOUNCED A THE GRAND DUOS WHICH IS DUAL-CORE AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE WAIT FOR IT.
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I REALLY LIKED THE PHONE, WHEN THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT. GREAT FINISHING! LATER I WENT THROUGH THE REVIEWS OF THIS PHONE, AND FOUND MANY OF THEM COMPLAINING THAT THE PHONE LAGS! YES! IT DOES LAG! :(.. SO I DISCARDED THIS PHONE FROM MY WISHLIST! LATER MY FRIEND GOT THIS PHONE. IT WAS BLACK IN COLOR, LOOKED REALLY ELEGANT! I WENT THROUGH THE SETTINGS OPTION, AND WHEN I WAS SCROLLING DOWN, IT DID LAG! AND THE SCREEN WENT UNRESPONSIVE! IT DOESN'T JUSTIFY 1 GHZ PROCESSOR!  SCROLLING WAS NOT THAT GOOD! I DID PLAY GAMES, THEY SEEMED FINE! CAMERA QUALITY WAS OK! I WOULD SUGGEST U ALL GO FOR THE PHONE ONLY, WHEN U DON'T STICK TO THE PHONE ALWAYS! OTHERWISE ITS A GOOD PHONE. BEFORE SELECTING ANY PHONE, GO THROUGH MANY REVIEWS, AND THEN FINALIZE."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"I REASERCHD FOR SOME MANY MONTHS BETWEEN XPERIA U N THIS PHONE ITS JUST CRAP
      
      FIRST OF ALL ITS DAM SLOW U HAVE TO WAIT FOR EACH N EVRY APP TO OPEN I DONT KNOW WHY SAMSUNG HAS BUILT SUCH A SLOW PHONE ALL  MY FRIENDS ARE GIGLING AT ME FOR THIS PHONE
      
      SECOND ITS MUSIC PLAYER DOSNT WORK IT GET HICKUPS FOR WHICH I HAVE TOTALLY LOST INTEREST IN LISTENING TO MUSIC N DEN
      
      THIRD IS IT HAS SO MANY LAGS IN CONNECTIVITY WITH LAPPY N CONFIGURATION
      
      NOW I AM STUCKED WITH A SLOW PHONE PAYING 17 K WITH NO MUSIC PLAYER AND HANGS ALL THE TYM
      
      ITS JUST CRAP"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"ICS CAN MAYBE ABLE TO RUN ON 786 MB RAM, BUT JELLY BEAN NEEDS 1GB TO 2GB RAM (2 GB IS MORE SUITED) SO BUYING THIS PHONE MIGHT NOT BE TOO SUITABLE FOR JELLY BEAN UPDATE.
      
      
      OTHER FEATURES ARE OK IN THIS PHONE, BUT IF YOU CAN WAIT, NEWER BETTER MODELS OF SAMSUNG ARE COMING NEXT MONTH."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"ITS BETTER YOU BUY SONY XPERIA MIRO OR SONY XPERIA JON BEHALF OF SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS BEACAUSE THIS MOBILE LAGS BUT SONY XPERIA MIRO IS FASTER THAN THIS MOBILE PHONE .
      
      SONY XPERIA MIRO HAS 800MHZ CORTEX A-5 PROCESSOR BUT IT WORKS LIKE 1GHZ . SONY XPERIA MIRO IS FAR BETTER THAN THIS ."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"KARBONN'S A18 HAS EXACTLY THE SAME FEATURES APART FROM VERY FEW VARIANCE... BUT IT IS REALLY FAST AND THE PERFORMANCE IS OUTSTANDING. IF U ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS, PLEASE GIVE A LOOK TO THAT MOBILE WHICH COMES FOR JUST RS.9750 ON FLIPKART."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"MOBILE COMPLETELY HANGS WHILE USING MULTIPLE APPS.INSTALLING MORE APPS ALSO REDUCES THE SPEED OF MOB.

      PERFORMANCE:
      
      I DINT FEEL LIKE INSTALLING ANY HIGH END GAMES AFTER USING THIS. I KNOW IT WILL HANG. IT IS TAKING SOME TIME TO LOAD CONTACTS AND OTHER BASIC APPLICATIONS ONLY.

      DRAWBACKS -
      
      
      I CAN ONLY SEE 1.78 GB OF TOTAL SPACE WHEN I GO TO STORAGE IN PLACE OF THE 4GB THAT IS ADVERTISED ON THIS SITE AND ELSEWHERE ! WITH A FEW APP DOWNLOADS I NOW SEEM TO HAVE ONLY 300 MB OF THAT LEFT.
      
      
      I HAVE PUT IN A 32 GB EXTERNAL SD CARD AND IT HAS MORE THAN 22 GB FREE ON IT (THE REST ARE PICS AND VIDEOS), BUT THESE 22 GB ARE RENDERED USELESS BECAUSE THERE IS NO FACILITY TO MOVE THE APPS AND/OR THEIR DATA TO THIS EXT SD CARD.
      
      
      HAD I KNOWN THIS ISSUE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE APPS TO THE SD CARD, I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CONSIDERED A LOWER CAPACITY EXT SD CARD OR BETTER EVEN A PHONE WHICH HAD THE FACILITY OF MOVING APPS TO THE EXT SD CARD."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"RECENTLY, I PURCHASED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART JUST A WEEK AGO. FLIPKART DELIVERED THE PRODUCT WELL WITHIN TIME AS COMMITTED. CONFIGURATION WISE, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PHONES IN DUAL SIM RANGE OF SAMSUNG AS COMPARED TO OTHER COMPETITORS (DUAL SIM PHONES) IN THE MARKET. HOWEVER, THE ONLY CONCERN WHAT I HAVE FROM THIS PHONE IS THAT I HAVE INSTALLED A COUPLE OF APPS FROM GOOGLE PLAY AND IT HAS BECOME DEADLY SLOW DUE TO LESS RAM. THIS IS BOTHERING ME A LOT. NOW I AM FEELING THAT I SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR A SINGLE SIM PHONE INSTEAD OF DUOS IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE AND I COULD HAVE GOT A BETTER CONFIGURATION PHONE."

      SO DONT PURCHASE GO FOR GOOD ONE"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"SMARTPHONES FREQUENTLY GET OUTDATED DUE TO TECHNOLOGY UP-GRADATION. SAMSUNG S DUOS, AFTER ALL MY RESEARCH, DELIVERS AVERAGE PERFORMANCE DUE TO NOT HAVING DUAL-CORE PROCESSOR AND AT LEAST 1GB RAM. SOON, JELLY BEAN WILL BECOME A NORM AND THIS HARDWARE CONFIGURATION WILL PINCH WHICH S DUOS IS OFFERING AT THIS PRICE. IN 2013, MANY NEW SMARTPHONES ARE COMING TO INDIA, SO WILL WAIT FOR THAT. PERSONALLY, I HAVE FIXED MY EYES ON LENOVO SMARTPHONES AVAILABLE FROM NEXT MONTH, AND HAS EVERYTHING AT VERY COMPETITIVE PRICES."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"TEMPLE RUN NOT WORK FINE IN THIS PHN,IT RUN SMOOTHLY BT SOME TIME IT WILL NOT RECIVE COMMAND JUMP,SLIDE, I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS WILL HAPPEND,BT I M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PHN ABT GAMING.OTHERWISE PHN IS QUITE GOOD"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"THE MOBILE IS 'SLOW &AMP; HOT' :-P ON 07 FEBRUARY 13
      
      DEEPAK RATED:
      
      
      1)THE MOBILE IS VERY SLOW. YOU CANNOT ADD ANY MORE APKS OTHER THAN FACTORY INSTALLED. THE RAM ISN'T SUFFICIENT AT ALL. SOMETIMES, APKS DOESN'T RESPOND AND CLOSES THEMSELVES.
      
      2)THE PICTURE QUALITY FROM THE 5MP CAMERA IS NOT SO APPRECIATING. MY OTHER BRAND PHONE'S 2MP CAM GOT GOOD QUALITY AND SHARPNESS IN PICTURE.
      
      3)BE CAREFULL WHILE USING INTERNET, YOU MAY BURN YOUR HANDS. THE BATTERY GETS HEATED UP A LOT.
      
      4) THE ITEM SPECS SAYS THE PHONE GOT INTERNAL MEMORY: 4GB &AMP; RAM: 768MB. BUT, I COULD FIND ONLY 2GB &AMP; 645MB. I DONT KNOW WHERE AM I MISSING THE REST.
      
      
      FLIPKART: IT PROVIDES A GOOD SERVICE, FAST DELIVERY, GOOD PACKING, GOOD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. ALMOST, EVERY PRODUCT ON HERE IS TRUSTWORTHY."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"THINK BEFORE BUYING.
      
      YOU CANT TRANSFER THE APPS TO MEMORY... EVEN WITH HELP OF OTHER APPLICATION AVAILABLE YOU CANT TRANSFER IT. SO YOU ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO MEMORY ... ALL APPS USES YOUR INTERNAL MEMORY.
      
      STILL WAITING FOR SAMSUNG TO UPGRADE THIS ELSE PLEASE DONT BUY."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"THIS IS A REAL FAKE!! IT LOOKS LIKE SAMSUNG GALAXY S# AND IS ALSO VERY ATTRACTIVE.....
      
      I GOT IT LAST MONTH FROM A NEARBY STORE... I WORKED SMOOTHLY FOR SOME DAYS BUT NOW IT IS LAGGING...
      
      MY BIGGEST MISTAKE WAS THAT I DIDNT CHECK FLIPKART REVIEWS BEFORE GETTING IS..
      
      IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES IN SMALL QUANTITIES...
      
      
      IT IS A REAL CRAP....
      
      
      TO BUY IT OR NOT IS YOUR CHOICE..
      
      
      BUT I RECOMMEND SONY XPERIA MIRO..
      
      OS GO FOR IT AND GOOD LUCK.!!"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORSE PRICE FOR VALUE DEVICE SAMSUNG HAS OFFERED. 1 GHZ SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR AT PRICE AROUND RS 17,000. I WOULD RATHER GO FOR SONY DEVICE WHICH HAVE DUAL CORES AND BETTER GPU LIKE SONY XPERIA SOLA OR XPERIA U.
      
      IN MY OPNION IT SHOULD HAVE COSTED BELOW OR AROUND RS 15,000."
Galaxy S Duos,2,"THIS PHONE IS AVERAGE COMPAIRED TO OTHER SAMSUNG PHONES, ALSO ITS LITTLE EXPENSIVE ACCORDING TO THE FEATURES. THE PHONE IS GOOD FOR NORMAL BROWSING BUT HANGS REPEATATIVELY WHEN U R DOWNLOADING. ALSO YOU TUBE DOES NOT RUN IN 2G CONNECTION, U NEED TO HAVE INSTALL OTHER BROWSER TO RUN. LOOKS ARE GOOD BUT SEEMS A FAKE ONE WHEN IT COMES TO SERVICES.
      
      YOU COULD PURCHASE OTHER GOOD QUALITY PHONES IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE PR  BY PAYING LITTLE
      
      EXTRA"
Galaxy S Duos,2,"THIS PRODUCT YOU CAN FIND :
      
      1- SMART PHONE YOU CAN HAVE WITH LOW BUDGET (ANDROID APPS,SAMSUNG APPS ,GPS TAGGING AND WIFI).
      
      2- FINE CAMERA 5MB AND MORE CHAT CAMERA IN THE FRONT.
      
      3- GOOD BUTTERY USE TIME DUO TO THE MODERATED PROCESSOR.
      
      BUT
      
      YOU WILL MISS THAT :
      
      1-RUN MORE APPS IN THE SAME TIME (RAM 645 MB !!!)
      
      2-GAMER DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
      
      3- MOST SHORT CUT MENU RELATED TO THE LEFT BUTTONS ARE NOT THERE. ( I CANN'T COPY MY CONTACT LIST FROM SIM TO PHONE )"
Galaxy S Duos,2,YOU CAN USE YOUR BLUETOOTH HEADSET ONLY FOR CALLING. FOR THAT TOO YOU HAVE TO EXPLICITLY SELECT HEADSET EVERYTIME. YOU CAN'T LISTEN MUSIC BY BLUETOOTH. AND OTHER SOUNDS ALSO NOT ABLE TO TRANSFER ON BLUETOOTH HEADSET.
Galaxy S Duos,1,"AFTER USING FOR 15 DAYS FROM THE DATE BOUGHT. IT'S STARTED TO GIVE ME A PROBLEM. VISIT THE SERVICE CENTER TO FIX THE PROBLEM, THEY RE-INSTALLED THE OS AND INFORMED ALL THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED BUT AGAIN THE SAME PROBLEMS ARE OCCURRED. VISIT THE SERVICE CENTER AGAIN, NOW THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE CHANGE THE MOTHERBOARD AND ALL THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED. MY PHONE IS UNDER WARRANTY BUT THEY WON'T GIVE THE REPLACEMENT EVEN THOUGH IT'S HAD A MANUFACTURE DEFECT IN THE MOTHERBOARD.
      
      
      I SUGGEST TO EVERYONE DON'T BUY ANY SAMSUNG PHONES. THEY HAVE POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WARRANTY SUPPORT."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"ALTHOUGH ITS SPECS SPEAK SO LOUD BUT THE QUALITY IS VERY POOR. ITS VERY VERY SLOW RESPONSIVE AND POOR-FEATURED PHONE. IF YOU BUY IT , EVEN AFTER READING THIS REVIEW  THEN YOU ARE DEFINITELY FOOLED. SO I ADVISE YOU ALL PLEASE DONT BUY IT I AM ALREADY SUFFERING AND PLANNING TO SWITCH ONTO ANOTHER XPERIA PRODUCT."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"AS IT IS MENTIONED IT USES CORTEX A5 SINGLE CORE 1 GHZ PROCESSOR. NOT A7 , NOT A9 BUT MORE THAN 1 YEAR OR 1 AND HALF YEAR AGO LAUNCHED SLOW PROCESSOR.EVEN MICROMAX,LAVA, KARBON ARE USING QUADCORE CORTEX A7 PROCESSOR OR DUAL CORE A9 PROCESSORS. A5 PROCESSORS ARE NOT USED COZ OF ITS SLOW RESPONCE NOW A DAYS. SO THINK BEFORE WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE. BUT IF YOU WANT A PHONE FOR SHOWOFF AND YOU ARE NOT GAMER OR USES PHONE FOR JUST CALLING AND LIGHT APPLICATIONS THEN YOU CAN GO FOR THIS PHONE BUT KEEP IN MIND FOR THAT PURPOSE YOU CAN BUY A ANDROID PHONE OF AROUND 5 THOUSAND FROM LAVA, MMX OR KARBONN AND TRUST ME EVEN THOSE PHONE WILL BE BETTER THAN THIS. THIS PHONE JUST TOO MUCH PRICED FOR ITS FEATURES BUT I THINK THEY ARE CHARGING FOR THEIR BUILD QUALITY MATERIALS, NOT FEATURE.
      
      I RECOMMEND MICROMAX A90S FOR LIGHT USERS DUAL CORE CORTEX A9 PROCESSOR  (LIGHT IN WEIGH AND SMALL 4.3 INCH SCREEN) OR LAVA XOLO  Q800 FOR HEAVY USERS QUADCORE CORTEX A7 PROCESSOR ( A LITTLE HEAVY AND 4.5 INCH SCREEN) IN THIS PRICE SEGMENT."
Galaxy S Duos,1,BAD BATTERY. DRAINS OUT EVEN IF ITS NOT BEING USED. OK FEATURES. TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVITY NOT AS GOOD AS IPHONE... USING THIS PHONE GAVE ME THE CONVICTION THAT IPHONE IS THE BEST SMARTPHONE IN THE WORLD
Galaxy S Duos,1,"BEING A LOYAL SAMSUNG CUSTOMER, I DECIDED TO OPT FOR THIS PHONE WHEN I LOST MY HTC WILDFIRE. I WANTED A PHONE AROUND 12K AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A BEST FIT CONSIDERING IT HAD THE LATEST ANDROID VERSION AND 1 GB RAM AND OF COURSE THE SAMSUNG LABEL. BUT, I NOW REALIZE IT WAS A HORRIBLE DECISION. AFTER USING THIS PHONE FOR 4 MONTHS, HERE'S WHAT I THINK:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      + GOOD DISPLAY
      
      + GOOD SOUND
      
      + CAMERA (IF YOU CAN GET IT TO OPEN WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      - HANGS ALL THE TIME. SOMETIMES IT WILL NOT EVEN LET YOU PICK UP A CALL. I DO NOT KNOW HOW COULD SAMSUNG GET THIS SO WRONG. THEY SHOULD HAVE DEDICATED RESOURCES FOR THE BASIC CALLING FEATURES.
      
      - WITH 1 GB OF MEMORY, I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO INSTALL AT LEAST THE BASIC APPS (FB, OPERA, GOOGLE DRIVE). SADLY, WITH SUCH A POOR PERFORMANCE, I HAD TO UNINSTALL ALL OF THEM.
      
      - THE 1 GB MEMORY IS AN EYE WASH AS THE MEMORY AVAILABLE TO APPS IS ONLY 645 MB, AND WHENEVER I SEE THE MEMORY STATUS, I SEE APPROXIMATELY 600 MB ALWAYS IN USE.
      
      - ONE WOULD THINK I HAVE MANY APPS RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND WHICH IS SLOWING DOWN MY PHONE, BUT HERE'S THE LIST AND I THINK THESE ARE JUST THE BASIC ONES YOU WOULD NEED FROM A SMARTPHONE:  EXCHANGE, GMAIL, GOOGLE DRIVE, WHATSAPP.
      
      
      OVERALL:
      
      I'M COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE AND IT DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE SAMSUNG BRAND. I DO BELIEVE THEIR HIGH END PHONES ARE TOP OF THE LINE, BUT THIS ONE REALLY DISAPPOINTS. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY ME WITH THIS PROBLEM, BUT MY FRIENDS WITH THE SAME PHONE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VERY SAME PROBLEM. MY SUGGESTION: BEFORE YOU BUY, ASK SOMEONE WHO HAS USED THIS PHONE FOR A WHILE WITH THE SAME APPS THAT YOU INTEND TO USE."

Galaxy S Duos,1,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2 MONTHS AGO AND REGRETTING IT, I CHANGED MY BRAND FROM NOKIA TO SAMSUNG AND THAT WAS THE WORST DECISION,
      
      
      ABOUT PHONE:
      
      - EATS BATTER LIKE A HUNGRY MONSTER(IF YOU USE WITH INTERNET ON) 100% CHARGED BATTERY DECREASES TO 50% IN JUST 4 HOURS..
      
      - HANGS UP OFTEN(I MEAN VERY OFTEN)
      
      - IT TAKES AGES TO OPEN THINGS LIKE MESSAGES, CONTACTS, CAMERA ETC..(U HAVE TO WAIT A LOT BELIEVE ME)

Galaxy S Duos,1,"BUYING THIS PHONE WHEN THEY WERE SELLING THIS FOR 16500/- IS ONE OF THE WORST DECISIONS I HAVE MADE IN RECENT TIMES. IT IS NOT WORTH IT EVEN AT THE CURRENT PRICE OF 12000/-.
      
      
      I AM FORCED TO GIVE A ONE STAR AS THERE WAS NONE BELOW THAT."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"DELIVERY FROM FLIPKART TAKES SUCH A LONG TIME THAT IT ALMOST KILLS THE INTEREST OF BUYING THE NEW PHONE. WHERE I CAN TRACK THE SHIPMENT OF MY PHONE IT CAN EASILY REACH ITS DESTINATION WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS, THE TIME TAKEN BY FKL IS USUALLY 4 BUSINESS DAYS.
      
      
      LET'S COME TO THE PHONE PART.
      
      USER ACCESSIBLE MEMORY IS ONLY 1.78GB(4GB MEMORY IS A MYTH, THE REMAINING IS TAKEN UP BY THE PHONE'S DEFAULT APPLICATIONS). THE CLOSER YOU GO TO FILLING THE MEMORY, THE LONGER IT TAKES TO BRING YOUR PHONE FROM THE 'HANG' STATE.
      
      
      GETS HEATED UP EVERY INSTANT AND WHEN YOU TRY TO TAKE UP THE PHONE OFF THE CHARGER, DONT FORGET TO WEAR A GLOVE.
      
      
      DESPITE THE LOW PHONE MEMORY, YOU CANNOT MOVE ANY APPLICATION FROM PHONE MEMORY TO MEMORY CARD. THE MEMORY CARD BECOMES USELESS IN THIS CASE.
      
      
      THE WORST PART IS FROM SAMSUNG CUSTOMER CARE.
      
      GAVE A CALL TO SAMSUNG CUSTOMER CARE AND THEIR RESPONSE WAS ""MA'AM, IF YOU HAVE BROKEN THE SEAL, IT IMPLIES YOU HAVE BOUGHT IT AND HERE WE CLOSE THE DEAL"".
      
      
      RESULT: BOUGHT THE PHONE ON 21/05/2013. SOLD ON 22/05/2013 AT 9K."
Galaxy S Duos,1,DESPITE THE MOBILE GOING BAD IN A WEEK THE FIRM DID NOT RESPOND THE WAY THEY THEY TALK AND ADVERTISE. THE MOBILE HAS NOW BEEN REPAIRED BY CHANGING ALL THE INTERNAL PARTS INCLUDING THE MOTHERBOARD. DESPITE REPEATED CALL TO VARIOUS OFFICERS AND REPS THE MOBILE WAS NOT CHANGED AND OLD WINE HAS BEEN SERVED IN NEW BOTTLE. DESPITE THIS THE MOBILE IS STILL NOT WORKING AS STATED BY THE COMPANY IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENT. THE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IS BAD AND ALSO THE APPS FOLDER IS REDUNTANT. GOD BLESS THE SAMSUNG AND THEIR ADVERTISEMENT CAMPAIGN.THE MOBILE FOR ME IS USELESS AND IT FORMS THE PART OF MY DISPLAY IN USELESS  ITEMS.I HOPE SOMEBODY IN THE HIGHER ECHELONS OF THE SAMSUNG IS READING THIS AND RECTIFY THE ATTITUDE
Galaxy S Duos,1,DONT BUY ...ITS A WASTE OF MONEY... VERY BAD BATTERY BACKUP. IN THIS PRICE YOU HAVE TO GO WITH ANOTHER SAMSUNG OR NOKIA PHONES WHO GIVES GOOD BATTERY BACKUP.

      1. NETWORK RECEIVING PROBLEM,  GPRS IS TOO SLOW, PAGES ARE NOT OPENING .
      
      2. WE CAN NOT PLAY HD VIDEOS.

      5. FREQUENTLY INTERNET WILL DISCONNECTS .
      
      BASIC THINGS ONLY NOT TAKEN CARE IN THIS MOBILE. I WAS COMPARING THIS MOBILE WITH MY MICROMAX NINJA A89. EVEN THE COST OF THAT PHONE IS 6K, THEY HAVE TAKEN CARE ALL THE CUSTOMER NEEDS.
      
      IT PLAYS HD VIDEOS , BROWSING IS TOO GOOD.  IN THE VERY FIRST DAY I GOT BAD EXPERIENCE.

Galaxy S Duos,1,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE (NOT THROUGH FLIPKART) AFTER SOME INVESTIGATION AND RESEARCH, BUT I SHOULD SAY I AM DISAPPOINTED NOW.
      
      THE MAIN PROBLEM OF THIS DEVICE IS THAT ITS VERY VERY SLOW. I DO NOT EXPECT A DEVICE IN 13K RANGE TO BE SUPER FAST, BUT THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AT ALL. WITH 1 GHZ AND 768 MB RAM, I DO NOT GET PERFORMANCE WHICH MATCHES MY OLD MOBILE WHICH DO NOT HAVE ANY COMPARABLE CONFIGURATION WITH THIS PHONE. THIS PHONE LAGS IN EVERY THING THAT YOU DO, IT TAKES LONG TIME TO OPEN THE DIAL PAD, MESSAGE APP, CALENDAR, CLOCK, SETTING WHICH ARE VERY BASIC THINGS AND SHOULD NOT TAKE THAT MUCH TIME. THE MOST ANNOYING PART IS THAT THE SCREEN GOES BLANK WHEN A CALL ARRIVES. YOUR MOBILE WILL BE RINGING, BUT YOU CANNOT ACCEPT THE CALL OR DO ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER. ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS PHONE IS LOOKS AND DUAL SIM.
      
      I THINK WHOEVER HAS WRITTEN GOOD REVIEW ABOUT THIS PHONE ARE EITHER DOES NOT INSTALL ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS OR JUST USE THE PHONE TO MAKE CALLS. THE BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO VERY POOR
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. GOOD LOOKS (DECEPTIVE)
      
      2. DUAL SIM
      
      3. PRICING
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. DEAD SLOW - THE MOST DISAPPOINTING FACTOR OF THIS PHONE
      
      2. YOU CANNOT ATTEND CALLS SOME TIME AS SCREEN GOES BLANK AND MOBILE WILL BE RINGING
      
      3. POOR TOUCH RESPONSE WHEN PHONE IS HEAVILY USED DURING GAMES
      
      4. POOR BATTERY LIFE
      
      5. UNWANTED FACTORY APPLICATIONS JUST START AS SERVICE AND EAT UP MEMORY AND BATTERY
      
      6. LIMITED STORAGE AND NO APP TO SD
      
      7. POOR GPS RECEPTION, DOES NOT LOCK BY DEFAULT, EACH TIME YOU NEED TO CLEAR AND UPDATE A-GPS DATA WITH THIRD PARTY APP. REALLY ANNOYING
      
      8. POOR SIGNAL RECEPTION, MY IN-LAWS NOKIA X2 GETS VERY GOOD SIGNAL WHEN THIS PHONE DOES NOT EVEN SHOW SIGNAL.
      
      9. LOW QUALITY MUSIC PLAY BACK AND SUPPLIED HEAD PHONE IS ALSO NOT GOOD.
      
      10. LOUD SPEAKER VOICE LEVEL IS TOO LOW, YOU WILL NEVER WAKE UP IF YOU SET AN ALARM IN THIS :P
      
      
      OVERALL, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE. BUY IT IF YOU GET IT FOR SAY 8K MAX.
      
      CORRECTION, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE EVEN IF SOME ONE GIVES IT FOR 3-4K, THIS IS TOTALLY USELESS. I THINK IT IS BETTER TO GO BACK TO GOOD OLD NOKIA 1100, ATLEAST WE CAN MAKE AND RECEIVE CALLS WTHOUT ANY PROBLEM.
      
      
      SAMSUNG ARE YOU SEEING ALL THESE 1 START REVIEWS? WHY DON'T YOU RELEASE SOME SOFTWARE UPDATE WHICH CAN MAKE ATLEAST THE BASIC FUNCTIONS WORK SMOOTHLY. YOU HAVE RELEASED JELLY BEAN FOR MANY CHEAPER PHONES, WHY NOT FOR THIS. I THINK THE ATTITUDE IS JUST A SLAP ON CUSTOMERS WHO TRUSTED YOU."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE JUST TWO DAYS BACK AND I HAD A WORST EXPERIENCE,FIRST THIS MOBILE IS VERY SLOW AND IT IS GETTING HANGED FOR EVERY 1 HOUR AND I SOLD THIS NEXT DAY.MICROMAX IS VERY MUCH BETTER THAN SAMSUNG MOBILES"
Galaxy S Duos,1,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE ON 22ND FEB FROM A RETAILER SHOP IN W.B. THE PONE LOOKS REALLY PREMIUM, STYLISH, ATTRACTIVE AND IT FEELS NICE TO HOLD. THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF IT IS REALLY PERFECT- WITH 4 INCH SCREEN TO HOLD AND USE.
      
      BUT FROM THE FIRST DAY I FOUND THAT THE SOUND QUALITY IN THE EARPIECE IS NOT GOOD, I MEAN WHILE CALLING, THE SOUND IS KIND OF MUFFLED WITHOUT MUCH CLARITY AND ALSO THE VOICE CRACKED MANY TIMES. MOST OF THE TIMES IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CALLER IS SAYING. IT IS MAINLY A CALLING PHONE WITH DUAL SIMS- SO IF THE CALL QUALITY IS POOR THEN IT IS A BIG DRAW BACK. ALSO LATER ON I FOUND THAT THE PHONE IS LITTLE UNRESPONSIVE IN TOUCH SOMETIMES WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED FROM SAMSUNG. AND THIS TYPE OF CHINESE PHONE LIKE SOUND QUALITY AND TOUCH LAGGING IS NOT AT ALL EXPECTED FROM A 13 K SAMSUNG. EARLIER I HAD A 12 K, 3INCH SONY ERICSSON WHICH HAD MUCH MUCH BETTER TOUCH RESPONSE (BUTTERY SMOOTH AND QUICK) AND GREAT SOUND QUALITY. I STOPPED USING THAT BECAUSE OF BAD BATTERY. BATTERY BACKUP FOR S DUOS IS NOT BAD BUT SO SO.
      
      THIS PHONE IS ONLY GOOD AS AN ATTRACTIVE SHOWPIECE- THAT YOU HAVE A BIG SCREEN SEXY CHUNKY SAMSUNG MOBILE IN YOUR HAND. NOW I REGRET NOT BUYING GALAXY GRAND OR LUMIA 820 AS THEY ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS PHONE. GRAND OR LUMIA ARE MUCH COSTLIER. OK. BUT THIS DUOS DOES NOT WORTH 13 K. IT SHOULD BE 9K MAXIMUM."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"I BOUGHT THIS SHIT FOR 16300 RS, N ITS NOT EVEN THE SINGLE PENNY.....
      
      THIS IS D WORST PHONE EVER, ONLY 2 GB OF INTERNAL MEM N NO APPS CAN B MOVED TO EXTERNAL SD, THAT MEANS U HAVE MANAGE IN 2GB ONLY, YES U CAN KEEP UR OTHER DATA LIKE SONGS, PICS N VIDEOS IN EXTERNAL SD (MEM CARD) BUT NO APP WILL READ UR MEMORY CARD (LIKE VIDEOS LOCKER OR PICS LOCK, GUYS U KNW WAT I MEAN)....
      
      THEN AFTER 1 MONTH ALL UR GAMES EVEN TEMPLE RUN 1 OR BEACH CRICK WIL START LAGGING (ATAKNE LAGENGE), IF U EXCEED UR INT MEM BEYOND 1 GB, UR PHONE WILL SLEEP, IT WIL WORK MUCH SLOWER THAN SYMBIAN PHONE (N72 N ALL)..........
      
      RAM IS GUD BT WID THIS PROCESSOR OF NO USE....
      
      IF U DNT PLAY GAMES N NLY INTERESTING IN SHOWING OFF OR IN OTHER CASE JUST WANT A SAMSUNG GALAXY ANDROID PHONE THAN GO FOR THIS ONE, ELSE U KNOW WAT TO DO..."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"I DON'T SUGGEST ANY ONE TO BUY THIS .. IT HANGS A LOT . AND ANDROID OS IS TOO VIRUS PRONE.
      
      
      I WILL LOVE TO USE APPLE OR WINDOWS PHONE HAVING DUAL SIM OPTION. ANY IDEA IF NOKIA/MICROSOFT BRING IT TO MARKET SOON ?"
Galaxy S Duos,1,I GAVE 5 STAR FOR THIS PHONE BUT AFTER USING 3 DAYS I CAME TO KNOW HOW WORST MOBILE IS THIS....THIS IS THE WORST MOBILE I HAVE EVER SEEN.LAG IS THE ONLY THING IT DOES PERFACTLY....ITS WASTE OF MONEY...GUYS DONT GO FOR THIS MOBILE...I JUST SOLD IT OUT.I SHOULD NOT ALSO GIVE ONE STAR.THANK YOU
Galaxy S Duos,1,"I GIFTED THIS FOR MY FRIEND AND HE IS LITERALLY CURSING ME FOR THIS STUFF. THE BATTERY DRAINS IN  6-8 HOURS LIKE OTHER ANDROID DEVICES AROUND AND THE CAMERA SUCKZZZ HIGH TIME. I SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR LUMIA 620.
      
      GUYS, THE ERA OF ANDROID IS OVER UNLESS THEY COMES UP WITH SOMETHING MINDBLOWING.
      
      INVEST ON SOME WINDOWS OR IOS. DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON SOME CHEAP BUILD ANDROID SAMSUNG CRAP."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"I HAD GOT THIS PHONE FOR MY BROTHER LAST NOVEMBER SEEING IT HAD GOOD ENOUGH SPECIFICATIONS AND PRICED WELL TOO. WITHIN A MONTH HE STARTED COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PHONE LAGGING EXCESSIVELY.
      
      
      LAST WEEK MY HTC ONE X WENT KAPUT AND I AM USING THIS AS A BACKUP PHONE. I NOW REALIZE WHAT A TERRIBLE PHONE THIS IS, IT IS WORSE THAN MY FIRST SMARTPHONE (SAMSUNG GALAXY 3...NOT S3) WHICH HAD A 667 MHZ PROCESSOR AND A PALTRY 256 MB RAM. IT IS SO LAGGY THAT AT TIMES THE PHONE RINGS FOR ABOUT 5-6 SECONDS BEFORE THE CALLER NAME APPEARS, TILL THEN YOU KNOW THE PHONE IS RINGING, BUT YOU CAN'T ANSWER IT AS THERE IS NO OUTPUT ON THE SCREEN.
      
      
      WEB SURFING IS A BIG NO AS IT'LL TAKES SEVERAL MINUTES AT TIMES TO OPEN A PAGE. SIMILARLY, WHEN APPS ARE BEING UPDATED, YOUR PHONE IS USELESS AS NOTHING WILL WORK.
      
      
      LIKE I SAID, ON PAPER, THIS IS A GOOD ENOUGH PHONE, I MEAN IT ISN'T A DUAL CORE OR QUAD CORE, SO MY EXPECTATIONS AREN'T TOO HIGH. I AM OK WITH 1-2 SECOND DELAY IN OPENING APPS BUT 5-6 SECONDS IS A MAJOR HANDICAP. I WOULD BE OK IF THIS DIDN'T DO WELL ON HIGH GRAPHICS GAME, BUT PRICED AT CLOSE TO 12K EVEN NOW, AT LEAST IT SHOULD DO ALL THE BASICS WELL.
      
      
      NOT RECOMMENDED"
Galaxy S Duos,1,"I HAVE BOUGHT PHONE FROM FLIPKART AND GOT THE PHONE FROM VERY NEXT DAY BUT SAMSUNG S DUOS CELL PHONE IS VERY PROBLEMATIC IT IS GETTING AUTOMATICALLY RESTARTED VERY FREQUENTLY AND GETTING HANGED DURING CALL.
      
      
      I FEEL THAT IT FAILED TO WORK LIKE NORMAL OR BASIC PHONE."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"I HAVE THIS PHONE FOR ALREADY THREE WEEKS. NOW I WANT TO SAY ONE SIMPLE THING- THAT THOUGH CERTAINLY I DO NOT EXPECT S3 AND NOTE LIKE PERFORMANCE FROM THE PHONE AND THOUGH I HAVE NO PROBLEM THAT IT IS LITTLE SLOW, BUT HOW CAN I ACCEPT THE MOST WORST CALL QUALITY OF IT!!!. THE SOUND FROM ITS EAR PIECE DURING A CALL IS JUST LIKE A CHEAP CHINA PHONE WITHOUT MINIMUM CLARITY. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD FROM THE OTHER SIDE. THIS MAKES THE PHONE BASICALLY USELESS TO ME. I EVEN PERFORMED A SOFTWARE UPDATE AND REBOOTING AS THE SAMSUNG DEALER TOLD ME TO DO. BUT NO RESULT IN THE CALL QUALITY. THE SOUND IS ALL HAZY AND UNCLEAR. SO IF ONE CAN NOT USE THE PHONE FOR BASIC CALLINGS THEN THE PHONE IS A PIECE OF RUBBISH. EXTREMELY DISPOINTED ABOUT SAMSUNG AND I AM FRUSTRATED THAT I BOUGHT IT IN 13,500/-. TOTAL WASTE."
Galaxy S Duos,1,I PLACED ORDER AND THEY CANCELLED ORDER BECAUSE OF PRICE RISE .THOUGH I PAID FULL AMOUNT IN ADVANCE. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW TO HOW MANY ORDER FLIPKART HAS CNACELED ON SUDDEN PRICE DROP AND ASKED CUSTOMER SAVE MONEY BECAUSE PRICE HAS DROPED. IF I PAY ADVANCE FOR BOOKING OF PLOT CAN I CANCEL WITHOUT AND IF CANCEL I HAVE TO PAY DOUBLE OF ADVANCE. HERE I HAVE PAID FULL PAYMENT . ITS YOUR CHOICE CUSTOMERS TO GO WITH THESE KIND OF SELLER OR NOT
Galaxy S Duos,1,"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE IN JANUARY 2013 (NOT FROM FLIPKART) AND IT'S BEEN A DISAPPOINTMENT. YOU CAN'T SHIFT APPS TO EXTERNAL STORAGE AND ALL THE APPS HOG UP THE INTERNAL STORAGE.
      
      
      ALSO, THERE ARE CONSTANT DISCONNECTIONS IN THE GPRS WHICH SEEM TO HAPPEN AT RANDOM INTERVALS. I HAVE TO RESTART THE PHONE EACH TIME THE GPRS GETS DISCONNECTED AND IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WITH MY PROVIDER BECAUSE THIS HAS HAPPENED IN SEVERAL CITIES.
      
      
      THE BATTERY LIFE IS POOR, THERE IS NO HD PLAYBACK, THE CAMERA IS GOOD AND THE PHONE TENDS TO LAG A LOT. I WOULDN'T SUGGEST BUYING THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"IN SPECS THEY MENTIONED THAT THE PHONE HAS 5.1MBPS UPLOAD SPEED BUT IN REALITY THE UPLOAD SPEED DOES NOT GO ABOVE THAN 0.12MBPS ... I HAVE TRIED SAME TEST WITH HTC DESIRE X WITH THE SAME SIM CARD AND THE UPLOAD SPEED WAS MORE THAN 2MBPS....
      
      YOU CAN'T CALL THIS PHONE FULLY 3G...
      
      AND SAMSUNG IS LIAR."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"IT IS TRUE, THE SOUND OF THE PHONE IS VERY BAD. OFTEN THE SOUND FAIL AND IS CRACKING AND GOES AWAY WHEN CALLING. DON'T KNOW IF NETWORK PROBLEM BUT ALSO THE SOUND IS NOT CLEAR FOR HEARING. I USED MY SIM CARD IN OTHER PHONES AND THE SOUND WORKED VERY GOOD. SO NOT NETWORK PROBLEM. I THINK S DUOS IS A FAULTY MODEL. IT ONLY LOOKS GOOD BUT CAN NOT DO THE ONLY MINIMUM BASIC WORKS ALSO. PATHETIC SOUND HEARING. :((("
Galaxy S Duos,1,"IT'S BEEN 15 DAYS THAT I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE AND WITHOUT AN IOTA OF DOUBT I WOULD TERM THIS PHONE A BIG DISASTER. THERE AN OCEAN OF FLAWS, PREDOMINANTLY ITS LAGGING, WHENEVER YOU DO MULTI-TASKING.
      
      
      IT IS JUST MEANT TO DO ELEMENTARY WORKS. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY THIS DISASTER. THERE'S HELL LOT OF OTHER WORTHY PHONES AVAILABLE AT A MUCH BETTER PRICE."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"ITS INTERNAL MEMORY IS VERY LESS , IT WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO INSTALL MORE APPLICATION. IF YOU JUST WANT TO HOLD A ANDROID PHONE THAN GO FOR IT.
      
      
      MY ADVICE, IF YOU CAN AFORD UP TO 12K THAN ALSO YOU CAN AFORD UP TO 20K OF 18K
      
      BEST OPTION TO GO FOR DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND INTERNAL MEMORY IS MORE THAN 8 GB.
      
      
      SO YOU WILL NOT REGRAT LIKE ME . :("
Galaxy S Duos,1,"ITS JUST BEEN 15 DAYS SINCE I BOUGHT IT.
      
      THEN WHEN I STARTED USING IT A BIT MORE INTENSELY I REALISED THT THIS DAMN PHONE SUKS AT HANDLING SIMPLE TASKS N DEFINETLY MULTITASKING.
      
      IF U HAVE THE DATA CONNECTION SWITCHED ON N U SWITCH B/W APPS IT GIVES ALMOST A 5SEC LAG....N ITS SOO DAMN ANNOYING. I THINK THE HOME KEY OF MY PHONE IS GONNA RUIN SOON CUS I HIT IT SOO HARD WHEN IT GIVES A LAG...
      
      VERY BAD EXPERIENCE..... THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IT HAD A DUAL CORE.
      
      GALAXY SIII MINI WAS MY PERFECT CHOICE BUT ITS NOT OFFICIALLY AVAILABLE IN INDIA SO I HAD TO GO WITH THIS STUPID PHONE"
Galaxy S Duos,1,ITS NOT GOOD PLEASE DON'T BUY.. I BOUGHT IT N AM LIKE SUFFERING FROM THE DAY I BROUGHT THIS PHONE.. ITS NOT EVEN WORTH 10K.. LOOKS ARE GOOD.. BUT IT WILL BE VERY VERY SLOW LATER.. CANT INSTALL MANY APPS COZ PHONE WILL BE STUCK.. I GOT A PROBLEM WHERE MY PHONE WAS COMPLETELY STUCK FOR HALF N HOUR..
Galaxy S Duos,1,"MY DEAR FRIENDS ..NEVER EVER TRY TO BUY THIS PHONE...THIS IS TOTALLY USELESS PHONE..THESE ARE SOME ISSUE I WANT TO HIGH LITE:
      
      1. FREQUENT HANGING
      
      2. U WILL UNABLE TO RECEIVE THE CALLS IF U USING INTERNET
      
      3. IF U TRY TO USE BOTH  SIM THEN ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO RECEIVE CALLS
      
      4. IF U WANNA SMS THEN IT WILL TAKE 2 MIN TO RESPOND....VERY VERY BAD WORKING
      
      
      SOMTIMES I FEEL THAT I BREAK MY PHONE..U FEEL TO DO SUICIDE...THIS IS TOTALLY WASTE OF MONEY..
      
      I M USING MY NOKIA PHONE INSTEAD OF THIS PHONE...
      
      
      THIS NEED SO MANY IMPROVEMENT.
      
      RUBBIS PHONE..DONT BUY MY FRIENDS."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"PIECE OF SCRAPPPPP......THIS IS REALLY A WORST PHONE EVER MANUFACTURED, BOUGHT FROM LOCAL MARKET 10 DAYS BACK BUT MADE ME DISAPPOINTED, ITS TOUCH VIZ IS BAD, HANGS AND LAGS ALL THE TIME, SLOWER CPU, HANGS IF I GET ANY CALL WHILE WATCHING MOVIE OR LISTENING TO MUSIC, I UPDATED PHONE'S SOFTWARE BUT IT STILL HAS SAME ISSUE. MAJOR DRAWBACK IS BATTERY DRAINS VERY FAST, IT HAS TO BE CHARGED AFTER 2-3 HRS, EARLIER I WAS USING LG OPTIMUS L3 E400, THAT WAS SUPERB PHONE, NO HANGS NO LAGS JUST CAMERA WAS BAD, S HAS ANDRENO 200 BUT SLOWS DOWN WHILE PLAYING KILLER KING, MY OPTIMUS PLAYS IT WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN.
      
      -GOOD 4 INCHES SCREEN
      
      -GOOD CAMERA
      
      - DUAL SIM

      BAD TOUCH RESPONSE SIMILAR TO CHINA MADE PHONES
      
      CANT MOVE APPS TO SD
      
      ACTUAL INTERNAL MEMORY IS 1.8 AND NOT 4GB.............
      
      USELESS INBUILT SOFTWARES, JUST CONSUMES MEMORY
      
      APPLICATIONS OPEN VERY SLOWLY
      
      I HAVE READ REVIEWS OF SUM PEOPLE SAYING THIS GREAT BUY, GOOD PHONE, I MUST SAY THESE PEOPLE ARE BRIBED TO SAY SUCH THINGS COZ IT IS ALL FAKE, I AM GOING TO SELL THIS PIECE OF CRAP BUY IF U GET IT SAY 5 TO 6K..........MY RATING IS 1/2 OUT OF 5.
      
      TO AJAY REDDY : LOOK MR DONT GET FOOLED AND MAKE OTHERS FOOL, THIS IS PIECE OF CRAP HANGS LAGS ALL THE TIMES IT IS SIMILAR TO CHINA MADE PHONE IF COMPAIR ITS PERFORMANCE....MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED THIS PHONE HAVE GONE THRU MAJOR PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND OTHERS WHO RATED THIS CRAP AS A GOOD PHONE MUST BE NEW TO ANDROID OR USING FIRST TIME....YOU ARE REAL FOOL WHO RATED THIS PHONE AS GOOD...IT SEEMS U ARE VERY NEW TO ANDROIS OR HAVEN'T USED THIS PHONE JUST HEARD SOMTHING FROM SUMWHERE AND DECLARED THIS AS A GOOD PHONE SAMSUNG FCUKS THEIR CUSTOMERS AGAIN WITH THESE KIND OF CHEAP PHONES... AND FOOL PEOPLE LIKE U RATING THIS A GOOD PHONE WITHOUT PROPERLY KNOWING IT....."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PHONE. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE JAN-2013. THIS PHONE IS VERY VERY SLOW. I NEVER EXPECTED SUCH A COSTLY PHONE HAVING HORRIBLE SLOW SPEED. BATTERY BACK UP IS ALSO NOT GOOD. NETWORK CATCHING VERY POOR. EVEN IN BANGALORE FULL NETWORK AREA I'M GETTING NOT REACHABLE.
      
      MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE PLEASE DON BUY THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"PLEASE GUYS NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS IS JUST A JUNK PART FROM SAMSUNG. THIS PHONE GET EVERY TYPE OF COMPLAINTS SUCH AS HANGS A LOT AND VERY SLOW AND THE FLASH OF THE PHONE MAKES YOU BLIND.
      
      THE FLIPKART CUSTOMER CARE WONT HELP AS WITH THE PROBLEMS ALSO.
      
      APP TO SD FEATURE WONT WORK AS IF IT HAS LOW INTERNAL MEMORY.
      
      BETTER NO TO BUY ONLINE."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"RECENTLY I HAVE PURCHASED SAMSUNG S DUOS AND I AM REALLY UNHAPPY WITH THIS MODEL , BECAUSE WHILE USING A INTERNET THE HANDSET BECOME VERY SLOW ITS COMPARE LIKE HANG , IF IN BETWEEN ANY CAL IS COMING TO YOUR HANDSET YOU CANNOT PICK A CALL IT SHOWS AFTER FINISHING THE RINGING IN MISSED CALL LOGS, AND SOME TIMES IF U R NOT USING INTERNET ON THAT TIME ALSO IT FUNCTIONS VERY SLOW SO I HAVE CONTACTED FLIPKART  REPRESENTATIVE BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPER ANSWER ."

Galaxy S Duos,1,"SAMSUNG IS A VERY SMART COMPANY. THEY ARE SIMPLY FOOLING EVERYBODY. THE 1GHZ SINGLE CORE ON THIS DEVICE IS WORTHLESS. TILL DATE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMBINATION OF 786 RAM AND 1GHZ ON THIS PHONE. THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A LOGICAL COMBINATION TO FUNCTION BETTER. 786 RAM ON 1GHZ SINGLE CORE IS LIKE PUTTING A 100 LITRE PETROL TANK ON A 2 WHEELER VEHICLE.
      
      
      AND AS MOST OF THE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THESE TECHNICAL TERMS, THEY EASILY FALL PREY TO THESE MARKETING STRATEGIES. BUT EVEN IF SALES OF NOKIA PHONE ARE LESS, THEY ARE DOING GENUINE BUSINESS. THE 256MB RAM ON THE FIRST LUMIA 510 IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THAT PHONE AND BELIEVE ME, THAT PHONE IS 3X FASTER THAN THIS S DUOS."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"SAMSUNG IS MAKING THE CONSUMERS FOOL...
      
      
      TOTALLY WASTE OF IT
      
      1. OVERPRICED
      
      2. TOO MUCH LAGS.
      
      3. VERY SLOW INTERFACE.
      
      4. DULL CAMERA.

      I HAD NEVER SEEN WORST PHONE BEFORE GO FOR MICROMAX CANVAS HD A116
      
      BETTER PHONE THEN THIS SONY ALSO FAILS IN DESIGN BEST QUALITY OF DISPLAYS SO BETTER GO FOR MICROMAX A116 BEST BUDGET LESS 15K"
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THE FIRST DRAWBACK OF THIS PHONE IS IT IS NOT UPGRADABLE TO JELLY BEANS 4.1......... ONE OF THE REASON I'M BUYING THIS PHONE IS THAT IT IS UPGRADABLE  TO 4.1, BUT IT IS NOT......SAMSUNG AND THE DEALERS OF SAMSUNG WILL CHEAT US....THEY SAID IT IS UPGRADABLE TO 4.1, BUT NOW THEY FACEOFF.
      
      
      SECOND THING IS ITS SPECIFICATION........
      
      IT IS SPECIFIED THAT IT HAS 768MB RAM BUT ACTUALLY IT IS ONLY 645.......
      
      DUE TO LOWER RAM PHONE SOMETIMES HANGS.......VERY IRRITATING
      
      
      4GB OF PHONE MEMORY BUT ACTUALLY IT IS ONLY 1.78GB AVAILABLE FOR USERS....
      
      
      THERE ARE ALSO SOME NETWORK PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE....... PHONE NETWORK DISCONNECT AND CONNECT AUTOMATICALLY........
      
      
      AT LAST I DONT SAY THAT SAMSUNG IS WORST COMPANY....
      
      I'LL RECOMMEND YOU TO GO FOR SAMSUNG
      
      BUT THIS PHONE IT NOT VALUE FOR MONEY.....
      
      INSTEAD THIS PHONE GO TO GRAND DUOS OR IF YOU WANT ONLY SINGLE SIM GO TO S ADVANCE....."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THE FONE HANGS UP VERY OFTEN...EVEN THE MESSAGES,CONTACTS,AND MOST OF THE APPS....IT HEATS UP TOO OFTEN ....
      
      I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS FONE...ITS TIME WE SAY GOODBYE TO SAMSUNG AND MOVE TOWARDS AN AWESOME SONY..!!"
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THE PHONE HAS GOT AWESOME LOOKS OUTSIDE BUT NOT INSIDE .I AM NOT FOND OF PLAYING
      
      GAMES ON MOBILE .BOUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS ON 22 MARCH 2013.INSTEAD OF THAT I DOWNLOADED TWO GAMES TEMPLE RUN WAS ONE OF THEM.THE PHONE HANGS UP WHILE PLAYING .WHILE MAKING A CALL IT HANGS TOO FREQUENTLY STARING AT PHONE ALMOST A MINUTE TO SEE THE NUMBER HAS BEEN DIALED .WAITING FOR THE PHONE TO RESPOND.HUH.....
      
      DONT BUY GUYS GO FOR BETTER HARDWARE IF WANT TO HAVE A BETTER  SMARTPHONE EXPERIENCE .
      
      DONT GO BY THE BRAND.
      
      I DELETED ALL GAMES AND NUMBER OF APPS TO GET IT WORKING.

      AGAIN ""DONT BUY FRIENDS"""
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THE PHONE IS VERY SLOW. BOUGHT IT FOR DUAL SIM PURPOSE AND AT TIMES HANGS IN THE MIDDLE. BATTERY IS JUST TOO POOR. HAVE TO CHARGE AT LEAST TWICE A DAY.
      
      LOOKING TO DISPOSE IT SOMEHOW.
      
      THE INTERFACE IS EASY AND INTERACTIVE. THE ONLY PLUS I'D GIVE IT."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THE PHONE LOOKS GREAT ON PAPER BUT FAILS TO DELIVER ON ALMOST ALL COUNTS.
      
      
      THE RESPONSE IS SLOW AND LAGGY, APPS TAKE FOREVER TO LOAD.
      
      APPS CANNOT BE MOVED TO SD CARD WHICH PREVENTS YOU FROM INSTALLING MORE APPS
      
      THE TOUCH INTERFACE IS BUGGY AND CANNOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A SWIPE AND A TAP
      
      SCROLLING WILL INADVERTENTLY LAUNCH APPS / OPEN THINGS YOU DO NOT WANT . EVEN TOUCHING THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN IS LIKELY TO ACTIVATE THE HARDWARE BUTTONS. FRUSTRATING TO SAY THE LEAST.
      
      
      I DONT GET THE ARGUMENT ""FOR ITS PRICE"", 13K (WHEN I BOUGHT IT) IS NOT CHEAP AND VERY GOOD PHONES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE PRICE.
      
      
      OVERALL , A MUST AVOID."
Galaxy S Duos,1,THE RESPONSE IS SLOW AND LAGGY. DON'T WASTE YOUR YOUR MONEY TO BUY THIS DABBA PHONE. I USED THIS PHONE FOR 5 MONTHS. THE MOST FOOLISH THING I EVER SEEN. VERY SLOW............................................................................
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THIS HANDSET IS THE SLOWEST HANDSET I HAVE EVER SEEN.
      
      
      DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, NEVER, NEVER.
      
      
      WHATEVER YOU DO ON THE HANDSET, THERE IS ONLY ONE RESPONSE: LAG AND A BIG LAG LATER AGAIN.
      
      
      IN SPECIFIC:
      
      
      1. THE PHONE BOOK OR CONTACTS OR CALL LOG TAKES AT LEAST 50-60 SECONDS TO LOAD;
      
      
      2. TURN ON SYNC, AND YOUR PHONE IS HANGED FOR A LONG TIME, YOU JUST CAN NOT STICK TO IT FOR LONGER. THERE IS A STRONG URGE TO THROW THIS HANDSET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WHEN IT HANGS.
      
      
      3. YOU CAN NOT MOVE THE APPS TO SD CARD, SO SD CARD SLOT BEING GIVEN ON THE PHONE IS UTTERLY USELESS. YOU CAN ONLY COPY OR MOVE YOUR PHOTOS OR VIDEOS TO SD CARD AND FOR THAT PURPOSE YOU HAVE A HELL LOT OF FREE CLOUD STORAGE AVAILABLE.
      
      
      4. WHEN YOU RECEIVE A CALL, 80-90% OF TIMES YOU WILL SEE A BLANK SCREEN WONDERING WHO IS CALLING? IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED TO KNOW WHO IS CALLING, YOU CAN NOT EVEN PICK A PHONE SINCE THE SCREEN IS BLANK. SAMSUNG IS SMART, IN A RECENT UPDATE THEY HAVE PROVIDED THE OPTION TO PICK UP OR END A CALL USING HOME AND POWER BUTTON, RESPECTIVELY.
      
      
      5. EVEN THE SO CALLED HIGH END NOTE 2 EVEN HAS THE SAME PROBLEM, YOU CAN NOT MOVE APPS TO SD CARD.
      
      
      6. OVERALL, THE P;HONE DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN A SINGLE STAR!!
      
      
      IT IS A THIRD CLASS MODEL BY ALL MEANS. NEVER EVER BUY IT OR NEVER EVER USE IT EVEN IF YOU GET IT FREE!!
      
      
      YOU WILL BE SUBJECTED TO SHORT-TERM ANXIETY DISORDER WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS BY USING THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THIS IS INFORMING TO YOU THAT ,PURCHASED MOBILE IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY AS PER SPECIFICATION GIVEN BY COMPANY, SOME TIMES IT IS WORKING VERYYYY SLOW AND SOME TIME IT IS HANG ,SO I'M UNHAPPY WITH THIS I HAVE REQUIRED JUSTIFICATION ANYHOW REG. THIS."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THIS IS MY FATHER'S PRIMERY PHONE AND I VE USED OFTEN.THOUGH ITS SPECS ARE DECEND AND IS GREAT LOOKING ITS PERFORMANCE IS REALLY POOR.IT IS LAGGY IN SIMPLE OPERASTION LIKE LOADING CONTACTS EVEN WHEN NOT MULTITASKING.IT REMINDS ME OF SYMBIAN WHICH DIDNT LAG EVEN WITH 3 OR 4 APPS IN THE BACKGROUND.THE DISPLAY IS ALSO NOT UPTO THE MARK.
      
      THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEN IS ITS PERFORMANCE AS MY FATHER IS A LIGHT USER WITH 3 OR 4 NAVIGATION AND HEALTH RELATED APPS ONLY AND STILL HAS A PHONE THATS WORKING WAY BELOW THE PAR FOR AN AVG SMARTPHONE.
      
      THIS IS A CLASSIC EG OF SAMSUNG TRIYING TO PLUNDER YOU."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THIS MOBILE FEATURES ARE GOOD BUT IT GET HANGED VERY FREQUENTLY. IT IS REALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAY GAMES ON THIS MOBILE. IT FREQUENTLY GETS RESTARTED IN BETWEEN THE CALL. VERY VERY BAD PRODUCT. I NEVER RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT OF SAMSUNG TO BUY.
      
      
      PLEASE NEVER BUY PRODUCT OF SAMSUNG. I COMPLETELY FEEL CHEATED AFTER USING SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS"
Galaxy S Duos,1,"THIS PHONE HANGS ALOT, TFT SCREEN, BATTERY PROBLEM ETC ETC.....BETTER BUY HTC DESIRE X OR WAIT FOR SAMSUNG S3 MINI OR LG F5  OR LG F7 WITH 8GB INTERNAL MEMORY. AFTER ONE MONTH U WILL FIND THIS PHONE @10K. DON'T HURRY BROS."
Galaxy S Duos,1,THIS THE WORST PHONE FROM SAMSUNG IT TAKES 3 HOURS FOR CHARGING AND GETS EXHAUSTED IN JUST 2-4 HOURS. ITS NOT AT ALL WORTH BUYING IT I WOULD REQUEST ALL OF U WHO ARE THINKING OF BUYING THIS PLS DON'T BUY IT OTHERWISE U'LL FEEL LIKE IN HELL. AFTER A MONTH THE PHONE'S PERFORMANCE GOES DOWN AND DOWN IT STARTS HANGING.
Galaxy S Duos,1,"VERY BAD PHONE... THE PHONE HANGS AND IS SLOW. IF YOU NEED TO CALL CONSECUTIVELY, YOU WOULD NEED TO GIVE THE PHONE AT LEAST 10 SECONDS BEFORE IT GETS READY FOR THE NEXT CALL.
      
      
      IT CLAIMS TO HAVE A SMART DUAL MODE BUT IT NEVER WORKS, SO IT MAKES THE PHONE A DUAL STANDBY PHONE. I AM SURE THERE ARE BETTER ANDROID PHONES IN THE MARKET THAT WORK AS A SMART PHONE KEEPING THE ""PHONE"" FUNCTIONALITY INTACT, BECAUSE AT TIME U CANT EVEN MAKE CALLS. BUY IT ... IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY"
Galaxy S Duos,1,"VERY POOR SIGNAL RECEPTION.
      
      I WAS OWENING SAMSUNG GALAXY FIT. GREAT SIGNAL RECEPTION. THE MOMENT I CHANGED THE SIM TO MY NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS S7562, THE SIGNAL RECEPTION IN THAT VERY POOR.
      
      I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR SOMEONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE A DUAL SIM SMART PHONE."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"WAT THE HELL......AM FED-UP WITH THIS PHONE....1) OPERATION IS EXTREMELY SLOW 2) PHONE HANGS REPEATEDLY 3) SOMETIMES THE PHONE DOES NOT DISPLAY THE CALLER NAME WHEN THE PHONE RINGS 4) DATA UPLOAD AND TRANSFER IS VERY SLOW. 5) TOUCH SCREEN OPERATION IS NOT EFFECTIVE 6) WHILE EXITING ANY APPLICATION THE OPERATION IS VERY SLOW 7) SOMETIMES WHEN I GO TO MESSAGE BOX, I CAN SEE THE CONTACT NO.S ONLY. AFTER FEW SECONDS THE NAMES OF CONTACTS START POPPING UP 8) FACEBOOK APPLICATION ALSO OPERATES VERY SLOW ON THE MOBILE. IT KEEPS SHOWING LOADING BEFORE DISPLAYING DETAILS ON THE SCREEN 9) AFTER TAKING A PHOTO OR VIDEO WHEN I WANT TO REVIEW IT, IT TAKES LONGER TIME TO LOAD. 10) I HAVE DELETED LOT OF APPLICATIONS FROM MY CELLPHONE DUE SLOW OPERATION AS WELL AS TRANSFERRED ALL THE PHOTOS, VIDEOS TO EXTERNAL SD CARD BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE NO IMPROVEMENT 11) WHILE VIEWING A PHOTO OR VIDEO THERE ARE LOT OF INSTANCES WHEN I TILT THE CAMERA BY 90 DEGREE, THE VIDEO OR PHOTO DOES NOT TIMELY ROTATE ON THE SCREEN 12) WHILE USING FB APPLICATION WHEN THE DETAILS ARE DISPLAYED AND I WANT TO SCROLL THE SCREEN, THE RESPONSE IS LETHARGIC."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"WELL I BOUGHT THIS PHONE PRIMARLY BECAUSE OF BRAND NAME SAMSUNG,,,...INSTEAD OF CANVAS 2......
      
      I MUST SAY ITZ THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER USED.....
      
      1) PHONE HANGSSS A LOTTT...MORE THAN WHAT U EXPECT
      
      2) CAN'T  RUN HEAVIER GAMES TEMPLE RUN ETC...GAME HANGS A LOT
      
      3) PHONE IS VERY SLOW...VERY SLOW.....
      
      4) BATTERY DRAINS FASTER"
Galaxy S Duos,1,"WHAT ABOUT THE HORRIBLE CALL QUALITY GUYS? DO U HAVE ANY ANSWER TO THAT? WHY ARE U SAYING THAT DON'T EXPECT LIKE S3. WELL I AM NOT EXPECTING IT LIKE S3 BUT WHAT ABOUT THE HORRIBLE CALL QUALITY IN THE EARPIECE? AN 1 THOUSAND RUPEES PHONE CAN ALSO PROVIDE THAT!!. IT SHOULD AT LEAST PROVIDE A BASIC GOOD CALL QUALITY. THAT'S IT! IT CANT EVEN DO THAT. IT CANT BE USED AS A BASIC CALLING DEVICE!. I AM NOT  DEMANDING ANYTHING AS SMART AS S3, BUT ONLY A BASIC GOOD CALL QUALITY GUYS!! I AM NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT ITS SMART PERFORMANCE, BUT ABOUT ITS BASIC USAGE FOR CALLING AND HEARING. AS EARLIER I HAVE SAID, I AM SUFFERING DUE TO THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S Duos,1,"WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IT WAS THE BEST DUAL SIM PHONE AVAILABLE AFTER SELLING MY SAMSUNG GALAXY Y DUOS (WHICH WAS THE ERSTWHILE BEST), BUT I MUST TELL THERE ARE SOME COMMON PROBLEMS WITH EVERY SAMSUNG DUAL SIM PHONE, THE TELLTALE SIGNS ARE AS FOLLOWING :
      
      1. AFTER A FEW WEEKS YOUR PHONE WILL TURN SLOW .. I.E IF YOU CLICK TO CALL IT WILL TAKE QUITE A WHILE
      
      2. BOTH THE SIMS KEEP LOSING NETWORK , FUNNY PART IS THAT AT TIMES IT WILL SHOW FULL NETWORK BAR BUT ONLY WHEN YOU CHECK YOU'D SEE ITS ON 'EMERGENCY CALL' OR 'NO SERVICE' STATE
      
      3. TRY PLAYING MUSIC AND ATTEND A CALL , THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT SOONER OR LATER IT WILL RESTART
      
      I DID PLAN TO BUY GALAXY GRAND LATER ON , BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT IT SUFFERS FROM SAME PROBLEM
      
      
      FRIENDS YOU MIGHT BE AVERSE TO MICROMAX OR KARBONN PHONES , BUT TRUST ME ABOVE PROBLEMS DON'T SURFACE ON THOSE PHONES
      
      
      I'M GIVING 1 STAR YET IT DESERVES NONE"
Galaxy S3,5,"1.FIRST OF ALL THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR SHIPPING THE PRODUCT IN JUST 2DAYS AND FOR OFFERING US THE BEST PRICE IN THE MARKET + FREE STUFFS.
      
      2.SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS WONDERFUL AS EVERYONE KNOWS......................."
Galaxy S3,5,"ACCORDING TO IT'S HARDWARE CONFIGURATION, VERY FEW OTHER MOBILES LIKE HTC ONE X CAN BE COMPARED WITH THIS. THIS MOBILE COMES WITH A LOT OF ""WOW!"" FACTORS INCLUDING ITS GESTURES. THOUGH IT HAS A LARGE SCREEN AND YOU CAN'T OPERATE IT WITH ONE HAND, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE IN SEARCH OF AN ULTIMATE, HIGH PERFORMANCE ANDROID PHONE. IT'S SPEED IS AWESOME. APPS AND GAMES CAN BE LAUNCHED IN FRACTION OF SECONDS. JUST GO FOR IT."
Galaxy S3,5,"AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION AND RESEARCH INTO WHICH PHONE TO GET, I SETTLED ON THE S3.
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR NINE MONTHS, I THOUGHT I WOULD USE IT FOR SOME TIME BEFORE WRITING A REVIEW.

      I SWITCHED FROM NOKIA TO ANDROID, AND AM GLAD I MADE THE SWITCH!
      
      
      THE ONLY CON THAT I HAVE FACED IS SOMETIMES THE CHARGER DOES NOT ENGAGE PROPERLY, AND THE BATTERY DOES NOT CHARGE. SO I HAVE HAD ENSURE THAT IT IS CHARGING.
      
      
      WELL RECOMMENDED"

Galaxy S3,5,"AWESOME PHONE, A MUST HAVE FOR ANY TECH-SAVVY.

Galaxy S3,5,"BEFORE I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE PHONE I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A BIG THANK U TO FLIP KART FOR GIVING THE BEST DEAL IN THE MARKET AND WONT SAY ANYTHING OBVIOUS ABOUT THE DELIVERY
      
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PHONE , THE SAMSUNG GALAXY SIII IS ONE OF THE FINEST DEVELOPED PHONE WITH BALANCED FEATURES AND SPECS .
      
      THE SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY IS A WOWW
      
      THE PROCESSOR SPEED IS AWESOME
      
      AND HOW CAN I FORGET THE MOTION AND GESTURE CONTROLS , ITS A  BANG FOR A BUCK
      
      
      I SEE MANY FOOLS COMPARING THIS PHONE TO MICROMAX CANVAS 2 , ITS IS LIKE COMPARING A MARUTI 800 TO A AUDI , WHERE IN BOTH CARS SERVE THE PURPOSE , BOTH CAR HELPS U NAVIGATE OR BOTH CARS HAVE A A/C OR MUSIC SYSTEM   BUT AUDI IS AUDI  AND MARUTI WILL BE MARUTI
      
      
      THE ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE IS THE SMALL HOME BUTTON AND THE NON AVAILABILITY OF BLACK COLOUR........
      
      THANKS"
Galaxy S3,5,"BOUGHT THE CELL THROUGH FLIPKART (27.5K+BT HDST+ 16GB SD CARD),  USING IT SINCE PAST ONE WEEK.
      
      
      WHY I CHOOSE IT?
      
      A FANTASTIC PRODUCT, SAMSUNG, SPECS WHICH CAN AT LEAST GO ON FOR NEXT 18 MONTHS OR SO. BEING A FLAGSHIP IT IS BOUND TO RECEIVE UPDATES TILL WHERE THE PHONE CAN STRETCH HENCE U CANT COMPLAIN ON THAT FRONT.
      
      THOUGH JUST AFTER MY PURCHASE NEXUS 4 GOT LAUNCHED WHICH COULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FIGHT. BUT STILL I FEEL IT BETTER OF THE TWO, MOST WILL SAY THE SAME, THOUGH THE LEAD IS MARGINAL.
      
      
      PROS: U ALL KNOW IT, AND HAS BEEN SAID HUNDRED TIMES. SCREEN IS ENOUGH TO BLOW YOUR MINDS OFF.
      
      
      CONS: BATTERY DRAINING QUITE FAST, OF COURSE BEING A NEW PHONE I AM USING A LOT OF LIVE WALLPAPERS, PLAYING GAMES ETC...LETS SEE AFTER A FEW WEEKS.
      
      
      SHOULD U BUY IT:  DONT HAVE AN IOTA OF DOUBT IF CANT OWN S4 DUE TO ITS PRICE....
      
      
      FLIPKART SERVICE: THEY MISSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE BY A DAY, NO COMPLAINS THOUGH. PACKAGING WAS NOT THE BEST THOUGH. I PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED A 1K CELL AND IT WAS PACKED LIKE A BALLON WITH BUBBLE WRAP.  THIS TIME IT WAS MEDIUM AT MOST. FK SHOULD PUT EXTRA PACKAGING FOR SUCH HIGH PRICED STUFF."
Galaxy S3,5,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT DURING THE SAMSUNG OWN-NOW OFFER.
      
      
      I NEED NOT SAY MUCH ABOUT THE PHONE, AS ITS BEEN PROVEN TO BE A BLOCKBUSTER PHONE FOR SAMSUNG. I WOULD SAY THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DEVELOPER SUPPORT THIS PHONE ENJOYS, NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT SAMSUNG IS OFFERING INSIDE(SOFTWARE) THE PHONE .
      
      
      HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS OF THIS PHONE ARE GOOD, BUT THE SAMSUNG ROM IS QUITE A LET DOWN. IT BRINGS DOWN THE PHONE'S PERFORMANCE CONSIDERABLY.
      
      BUY THIS PHONE ONLY FOR ITS HARDWARE. INSTALL A CUSTOM ROM IMMEDIATELY AFTER PURCHASE OTHERWISE YOU'LL START HATING THE PHONE. YOU'LL NOTICE LAG IF YOU DON'T RESTART THE PHONE FOR 2 DAYS, IF YOU ARE ON THE SAMSUNG'S STOCK ROM. BATTERY LIFE'S POOR TOO IN THE STOCK ROM. WITH THE CUSTOM ROM (INSTALL A GOOD ONE, NOT ANY CUSTOM ROM), THIS PHONE WILL BE A ROCKET WITH EXCELLENT BATTERY LIFE.
      
      
      FLIPKART'S SERVICE IS EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS. PHONE WAS DELIVERED WITHIN 2 DAYS OF THE ORDER. BUYING ANYTHING ONLINE BECOMES SO CONVENIENT WITH FLIPKART. KEEP IT UP FLIPKART."
Galaxy S3,5,"BY NOW, YOU SHOULD HAVE READ ABOUT ALL THE REVIEWS ON THIS BLOCKBUSTER PRODUCT. ITS FAST AND HAS SOME REAL COOL FEATURES. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PIECE WHICH WAS SHIPPED TO ME HAD SOME HARDWARE PROBLEMS LIKE NOT BEING ABLE TO CHARGE THROUGH USB. I READ FOR SOME REMEDIES ONLINE AND WENT ABOUT THE SOLUTION LATER TO FIND OUT THAT THE CHARGING TERMINAL WAS A BIT FAULTY. I FIXED IT MYSELF BUT WAS NOT EXPECTING FLIPKART TO DELIVER SUCH PRODUCTS. I GUESS ITS A HONEST MISTAKE."
Galaxy S3,5,"FIRSTLY LET ME KEEP UP AN WORD :- "" GALAXY S3 FEATURES ARE NOT FULLY KNOW TO ANY OF THE USERS WHO WERE YELLING ABOUT ONE X""
      
      SO I'LL MENTION THEM
      
      1. (IMPORTANT AND IMPRESSIVE) THIS DEVICE CAN TAKE IN ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL FACTORS. AN HEAT OF 150F OR YOU CAN JUST THROW IT INTO AN FISH POT OF CLEAN WATER AND EVEN ITS MIND BLOWINGLY TUFF.. DON'T TALK ABOUT THE BACK PANEL YOU CAN BEND IT BACK OR DO WHATEVER IT WON'T BREAK... EVEN YOU CAN KEEP IT UP IN REFRIGERATOR TOO AT DEEP FREEZE
      
      2. IT'S BENCHMARKS ARE LIKE SO BETTER THAN HTC ONE X...
      
      3. IT'S SEXY.. THE DESIGN WILL GIVE AN LOOK LIKE RICKY MARTIN TO YOUR PHONE
      
      AWESOME BEAST
      
      
      SENT FROM MY GALXY S3"
Galaxy S3,5,"FLIPKART IS GIVING THE PHONE AT IT LOWEST PRICE . YOU WONT GET THIS PHONE AT 28900 ANYWHERE.PLUS FLIPKART IS GIVING BLUETOOTH HEADSET AND 16 GB MEMORY CARD .AWESOME FLIPKART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      
      WHILE THE PHONE S3 IS BEST COMPARING TO OTHERS WHILE NOKIA LUMIA 900 AND APPLE IPHONE 5 ARE ALSO GOOD BUT THEY ARE LITTLE EXPENSIVE THAN S3 .SO I WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH S3!"
Galaxy S3,5,"FOR PEOPLE THOSE WHO ARE WAITING FOR ANY NEW PHONE TO COME UP IN THIS RANGE, FORGET IT AND BUY THE GALAXY S3 AS IT IS SAMSUNG'S FLAGSHIP DEVICE AND IT WILL GET MOST OF THE FUTURE ANDROID UPDATES. ALSO NO OTHER PHONE WITH SUCH GOOD SPECIFICATIONS AND RELIABILITY IS AVAILABLE AT THIS PRICE, SO JUST BUY THIS DEVICE WITHOUT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING ELSE. I AM PERSONALLY USING THIS DEVICE FOR A WEEK NOW AND IT'S JUST AWESOME, WHILE USING THIS DEVICE YOU ARE SURELY GOING TO GET NOTICED BY PEOPLE AROUND YOU."
Galaxy S3,5,"FRANKLY SPEAKING I LIKED FLIPKART SERVICES MORE THAN A PHONE :) GUYS DON'T TAKE ME WRONG , S3 HAS A PREMIUM FEEL ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND IT'S A VERY UPMARKET BUSINESS CLASS PHONE , I RECEIVED A BOXED PACK CONSIGNMENT FIRST HOWEVER IT HAD SOME MANUFACTURING FLAW AND UPON REPORTING TO FLIPKART IT WAS REPLACED IMMEDIATELY WITH A SEALED UNIT AGAIN WHICH IS WORKING ABSOLUTELY FINE , SHIPMENT WAS SO FAST THAT I DID NOT FELT EVEN ONCE THAT I DON'T HAVE A WORKING PHONE HANDY
      
      
      HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!"

Galaxy S3,5,"GOT THE PHONE HERE ON FLIPKART WHEN IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH MOST OTHER SOURCES, INCLUDING SAMSUNG E-STORE. BETTER DEAL (ONLY FOR THE RED COLOUR, THOUGH- PROBABLY OWING TO LOWER DEMAND) AND PROMPT DELIVERY.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS GREAT! I ALREADY HAVE A PEBBLE BLUE VERSION, AND GOT THIS ONE FOR A FRIEND. I HAVE HAD MY PHONE FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS NOW. NEVER FACED ANY ISSUE. I AM NOT ONE TO LOAD THE PHONE WITH TOO MANY UNNECESSARY APPS.
      
      
      THE CAMERA IS GREAT. IT PICKS UP NETWORK EVEN WHEN SIGNAL STRENGTH IS LOW (IN MOST CASES). BATTERY LASTS A DAY DESPITE USING THE PHONE EXTENSIVELY ON WIFI OR MOBILE DATA PACKAGE.
      
      
      IN ALL, I AM MIGHTY PLEASED WITH THE PHONE.
      
      
      IF YOU PLAN ON GETTING ONE NOW, I WOULD SUGGEST YOU WAIT FOR THE S4, THOUGH. EITHER GET THE S4 IF YOU CAN AFFORD ONE, OR GET THE S3 WHEN THE PRICES DROP FURTHER."
Galaxy S3,5,"GREAT PRODUCT..AMAZING PHONE,...LOVE THE PHONE...I HAVE BOT SO MANY MOBILES,AROUND 10 MOBILES I HAVE CHANGED,NOW THIS IS MY 11TH PHONE,AND I LOVE THIS A LOT..ITS GOOD IN IT FUNCTIONS,LOTS OF AMZING FEATURES AND ALSO THE BATTERY BACK UP IS GOOD...5 STARS FOR IT...Y SHOULD WE GO FOR SAM S4 AS S3 DOES ALL..B A PROUD A OWNER OF SAMSUNG GALAXY S3..........."
Galaxy S3,5,"HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM SOMETIME AND THIS ONE ROCKS...GREAT UI AND AMAZING SPEED. ALTHOUGH , THERE ARE MODELS IN MICROMAX WITH SIMILAR FEATURES AND AT A MUCH LESSER PRICE.. SAMSUNG OVERTAKES EVERYTHING WITH ITS AMAZING DISPLAY , GREAT SPEED AND OFCOURSE THE LOOKS . THERE HAVE BEEN DEBATES ALWAYS ABOUT THE PRICE TAG , STILL THIS ONE IS A GREAT ONE."
Galaxy S3,5,"HAVING USED HTC WILDFIRE S FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND TRYING TO MANAGE THE LIMITED SPACE BY UNINSTALLING APPS AND INSTALLING APPS TAKING LESS (VERY LESS!!) SPACE I DECIDED TO GO FOR A NEW ONE.
      
      
      HAVING FACED THE ABOVE ISSUE (IN AN OTHERWISE EXCELLENT PHONE) I DECIDED TO LOOK FOR 4 INCHERS AND SLOWLY STRAYED TOWARDS SIII MINI AND KEPT HOPING THAT SAMSUNG WOULD LAUNCH IT IN INDIA. FINALLY SAMSUNG LAUNCHED GALAXY GRAND DUOS, WHICH WAS TOO BULKY FOR ME, SO I JUMPED INTO THE SIII BANDWAGON.
      
      
      WHY I DID NOT WANT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE...I WAS NOT READY TO SHELL OUT THIS MUCH MONEY FOR A PHONE AND IT'S SIZE.
      
      
      HOWEVER I FINALLY WENT WITH IT BECAUSE IT'S A PHONE THAT IS FUTURE PROOF FOR NOW, WILL GET UPDATED BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OWNING IT AND HAS A DECENT BATTERY LIFE"
Galaxy S3,5,"HEY GUYS BEFORE YOUR BUY S3 , ENSURE THAT IT IS WITH UPDATED ANDROID? 4.1.2 (JELLY BEAN).
      
      IN MARKET MOBILES ARE AVALABLE WITH ANDROID? 4.1.2 (JELLY BEAN).
      
      
      THANKS TO SAMSUNG INDIA.. FOR THE NEW ANDROID VERSION IN S3"
Galaxy S3,5,"I AM AN ANDROID PERSON. AND A PHONE THAT PERSONIFIES ANDROID HAS TO BE S3. USING THE PHONE FROM FROM LAST THREE MONTHS AND ITS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.
      
      I AM ONE WHO HAS GRADUATED FROM ACE TO S2 TO S3 AND I CAN DEFINITELY SAY THAT SAMSUNG ADDS GREAT VALUE TO THEIR HANDSETS AS THEY MOVE TO THE NEXT VERSIONS.
      
      A MUST BUY FOR THOSE WHO TREAT THEMSELVES OH ANDROID"
Galaxy S3,5,"I AM REALLY SURPRISED THE WAY PEOPLE COMMENT HERE AND POST REVIEWS WHICH SHOW HOW MUCH IGNORANT THEY ARE. BTW I AM USING A HTC DESIRE V BUT THIS SAMSUNG DEVICE IS THE BEST DUAL SIM PHONE WITH ALMOST OK PRICE ONE CAN BUY! PLEASE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BASHED IT WITH STUPID COMMENTS GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT AND THEN POST! RAM IS 768 MB WHICH MATTERS A LOT RATHER THAN DUAL CORES WHICH ONLY RESULT IN FASTER PROCESSING AND LESS BATTERY BACKUP. IN ITS SEGMENT IT IS SIMPLY THE BEST BECAUSE OF FOLLOWING:
      
      -4"" DISPLAY UNDER 18K WHICH IS VERY GOOD
      
      -768 MB RAM
      
      -1500 MAH BATTERY WITH SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR WHICH MEANS GOOD BACKUP
      
      -DUAL SIM WITH CALL FORWARDING WHICH IS WHAT EVERY ONE OFFERS AND IS PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE RATHER THAN RANTING WHY NOT DUAL ACTIVE ETC.
      
      -ANDROID 4 AT LAUNCH WITH OFFICIAL UPGRADE TO JB WHICH MEANS FUTURE PROOF DEVICE AND PERFORMANCE WILL BE BUTTER SMOOTH
      
      -FRONT CAM FOR VIDEO CALLS WHICH MOST MANUFACTURER'S MISS OUT.
      
      -LED FLASH
      
      -MICRO SD CARD SUPPORT
      
      
      ALL IN ALL UNDER 20K THE BEST TROUBLE FREE PHONE BE IT USED AS SINGLE SIM OR DUAL SIM! NO OTHER DEVICE CAN MATCH IT IN TERMS OF SPECS AND SUPPORT. LG, NOKIA, SONY, MOTO...NONE IS AS GOOD AS THIS. AGREED SONY IS DUAL CORE BUT NO MICRO SD SLOT (U) AND 512 RAM (SOLA) PLUS 3.5"" SCREEN? WHATS THE USE OF DUAL CORE THEN IF RAM IS NOT ENOUGH? GOOD JOB SAMSUNG!
      
      
      WAS THIS REVIEW HELPFUL? YES / NO"
Galaxy S3,5,"I BOUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 AND AM IMMENSELY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT.
      
      SINCE I BOUGHT THE  GARNET RED PHONE,I GOT A HUGE CASH DISCOUNT TOO.THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THE COLOR.ON THE CONTRARY I LOVE THIS COLOR BETTER THAN THE WHITE AND BLUE ONES.
      
      FLIPKART DELIVERS WHAT IT PROMISES .ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10,I RATE THEM AT 10.
      
      I GOT MY STUFF DELIVERED ON THE 3RD DAY OF PLACING THE ORDER."
Galaxy S3,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ONE MONTH BEFORE, AND I HAD A FEELING THAT I SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR 20 MORE DAYS FOR S4 RELEASE.
      
      NOW I AM VERY SATISFIED ABOUT BUYING S3 WHEN I SAW S4 WHICH IS A PLASTIC PHONE(VERY DELICATE ONE) AND THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN S4 FEATURES APART FROM THE FRONT CAMERA INNOVATIONS (WHICH RECOGNIZES YOUR HAND MOTIONS, EYES ETC ETC AND PERFORMS ACTIONS) WHICH MANY PEOPLE WONT LIKE, S HEALTH IS ONE NEW APP WHICH I FOUND VERY INTERESTING IN S4.REST OF THEM ARE AVAILABLE IN S3 AS WELL"
Galaxy S3,5,"I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE THAT SOMEBODY HASN'T ALREADY SAID :)
      
      AS FAR AS THE DELIVERY IS CONCERNED, IT WAS QUICK, AS USUAL.. GREAT WORK GUYS AND HATS OFF TO THE MONDAY ELECTRONICS SALE :) GOT IT FOR A GRAND LESS..."
Galaxy S3,5,I DID HAPPEN TO PICK UP S-3 AND BEEN EXTREMELY HAPPY AFTER USING IT FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS NOW.I AM ALWAYS CONNECTED ON WI-FI AND APPS IS ON AND THE BATTERY DOES LAST FOR A DAY.CANT EXPECT MUCH FROM A SMART PHONE THOUGH WHICH IS AS POWERFUL AS A S-3.GOOD PHONE AND EXCELLENT SERVICE BY FLIP KART. I GOT THE PHONE DELIVERED IN LESS THAN 15 HOURS WHICH IS AWESOME.OVERALL A GREAT PHONE AND BUYING THROUGH FLIP KART WAS A GREAT DECISION.
Galaxy S3,5,"I DIDNT BUY THIS FROM FLIPKART BUT I MUST SAY THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PHONE.
      
      
      YES THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF REVIEWS ON THIS ALREADY SO HERE IS MY 2 CENTS ON THIS.
      
      
      - LOOKS GOOD AND FEELS GOOD IN THE HAND (I DONT CARE MUCH FOR A METAL FEEL)
      
      - SCREEN IS THE BEST PART AND MAKES YOU WANT TO KEEP PLAYING WITH IT.
      
      - GOOD CALL AND MSG FEATURES AND HAVE AN APP STORE TO CHANGE ANYTHING YOU DONT LIKE IN THE STOCK VERSION LIKE CONTACT VIEW, MSG VIEW ETC.
      
      - DECENT BATTERY LIFE.
      
      - FAST AND RUNS WITHOUT LAG IF YOU ARE RUNNING A FEW APPS, BUT DONT OVERDO IT AS IT MAY HAVE SOME PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH TOO MANY APPS OPEN ALL THE TIME. IT GAVE ME A COUPLE OF APP FAILURES AND WHEN I CHECKED I HAD ABOUT 34 APPS OPEN LOL.
      
      - BATTERY GETS DRAINED MUCH QUICK WITH ANY DOWNLOADED LIVE WALLPAPER SO BE CAUTIOUS OF THOSE.
      
      - NICE MUSIC PLAYER.
      
      
      OVERALL IT IS A GOOD TO HAVE PHONE AND VERY FEW WILL REGRET OWNING ONE."
Galaxy S3,5,"I DON'T NEED TO START WRITING ABOUT HOW GOOD THIS MOBILE IS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO PLAY AROUND THE DEVICE AND INSTALL CUSTOM DEVICES WHICH ARE EASILY AND WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR THIS FLAGSHIP PHONE. ALL I WANT TO SAY IS THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE CHEAPEST AND LOWEST PRICES FOR THE MOBILE (PRIMARILY BECAUSE ITS MANUFACTURED IN AUG 12). I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER I PLACED THE ORDER ON FLIPKART.
      
      
      THANKS FLIPKART FOR THE EXCELLENT SERVICE. YOUR SERVICE STANDARDS ARE RISING HIGHER BY THE DAY

Galaxy S3,5,"I DON'T THINK I CAN ADD MUCH, BUT I GOT IT RECENTLY, FLIPKART TOOK CONSIDERABLE TIME CLOSE TO 6-7 WORKING DAYS.
      
      
      HAVE BEEN SPENDING CONSIDERABLE TIME ON THIS DEVICE AND MY IPAD FEELS JEALOUS OF IT, LET'S SEE HOW THINGS WORK OUT BETWEEN THEM, RIGHT NOW, ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS IS A GREAT PHONE AND FLIPKART HAS A GOOD DEAL ON IT.
      
      
      RECOMMENDED"
Galaxy S3,5,"I HAVE 2 WORDS ""JUST AWESOME""
      
      
      THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PHONES I HAVE EVER USED AS IT CATERS TO EACH AND EVERY NEED OF MINE. I LOVE IT!!!
      
      
      GO FOR IT AND ENJOY :)
      
      
      THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS A CHIC SMARTPHONE THAT OFFERS COMPELLING NEW WAYS OF COMMUNICATING AND SHARING AND IS MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A SMARTPHONE THAT DELIVERS POWER AND SPEED."
Galaxy S3,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S III SINCE IT'S LAUNCH. AND BEING A BLACKBERRY AND NOKIA SYMBIAN USER BEFORE, THIS PHONE IS HEAVENLY TO USE! SO HERE IS AN EXPANSIVE SUMMARY OF MY EXPERIENCE:
      
      
      1.DISPLAY:
      
      THE DISPLAY IS VERY SHARP AND VERY VIVID AND ENTIRELY CUSTOMIZABLE FOR ENHANCING OR DEGRADING THE VIEWING EXPERIENCE. SAMSUNG PROVIDES FOUR CUSTOMIZABLE SETTINGS IN THE SCREEN MODE OPTIONS IN THE DISPLAY SETTINGS. THE DISPLAY AS EXPECTED CONSUMES MOST OF THE BATTERY POWER, WHICH ALSO DEPENDS UPON WHICH SCREEN MODE HAS BEEN SET. SUNLIGHT VISIBILITY IS AVERAGE.
      
      
      2.BATTERY:
      
      THE PHONE BATTERY AFTER CHARGING TO THE 100% MARK RUNS ABOUT A DAY WITH HEAVY PHONE CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGING. WITH THE DATA CONNECTION ON, IT RUNS TILL 06:00AM IN THE MORNING TO 05:00PM IN THE AFTERNOON, WITH DESPERATE ATTEMPTS TO SAVE BATTERY THOUGH. BUT UNDER MODERATE USAGE AND OCCASIONAL PHONE CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGING, THE BATTERY LASTS MORE THAN A DAY AT TIMES. BUT AS EXPECTED, I HAVE NOT YET HEARD OR SEEN HD ANDROID PHONES HAVING KILLER BATTERIES AFTER ALL. THEREBY THE BATTERY LIFE DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON THE USAGE PATTERN OF AN INDIVIDUAL.
      
      
      3.GRAPHICS:
      
      THE S III COMES EQUIPPED WITH A 1.4GHZ MALI-400MP QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AS HIGHLY OBVIOUS. THE PHONE SUPPORTS PRACTICALLY EVERY VIDEO FORMAT YOU MIGHT WANT IT TO PLAY. FOR INSTANCE, IT SUPPORTS WEBM, FLV, AND SO ON. AND I HAVE NOT USED ANY UNUSUAL VIDEO FORMAT YET, SO EXCUSE ME IF YOU FIND THIS INFORMATION INCORRECT. AND THE DEVICE PLAYS FULL HD FILES AS VERY MUCH EXPECTED OUT OF THE BOX. AND POINT TO BE NOTED, WHEN CONNECTED TO A PC AND COPYING VIDEO FILES TO THE EXTERNAL SD CARD OR THE DEVICE, A MESSAGE APPEARS SAYING,'
      
      WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONVERT THE VIDEO FILE BEFORE COPYING?' I ALWAYS CHOSE TO IGNORE THAT AND NEVERTHELESS ALL VIDEO FILES PLAY EFFORTLESSLY. BASIC GAMES ARE A PIECE OF CAKE FOR THE DEVICE, BUT HIGH PROCESSOR CONSUMING GAMES HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED BY ME, THUS NO COMMENT ON THAT.
      
      
      4.INTERFACE:
      
      THE DEVICE USES SAMSUNG'S CUSTOMIZED TOUCHWIZ 4.0 ICE CREAM SANDWICH PLATFORM. WHICH IN MY OPINION IS A FAR MORE ELEGANT AND BETTER LOOKING INTERFACE THAN THAT ON THE HTC ONE X AND ONE X+, WHICH HAS OPAQUE MENU BACKGROUNDS AND A DULL INTERFACE. SO, IF THE INTERFACE LOOK MATTERS TO YOU, YOU WILL AND SHOULD OPT FOR THE S III WITHOUT A HINT OF DOUBT.
      
      
      5.CAMERA:
      
      THE PRIMARY CAMERA IS AN 8MP AUTOFOCUS CAMERA, WITH CMOS AND A NOT VERY BRIGHT LED FLASH, IT CAPTURES PHOTOS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT EXCELLENTLY AND HAS A 1.3MP FRONT FACING CAMERA WHICH IS RATHER GOOD FOR SELF SHOTS. THE CAMERA IS AN ENTIRELY SOCIALIZING FEATURE OF THE DEVICE, WHICH IS CERTAINLY NOT MADE TO REPLACE A NORMAL CAMERA AFTER ALL. SO, BY PERSONAL OPINION EXPECTING A 12MP CAMERA ON A ALREADY WELL EQUIPPED DEVICE IS RATHER ABSURD.
      
      
      6.BUILD QUALITY:
      
      
      THE ONLY NOT SO IMPRESSIVE FACTOR OF THE S III IS IT'S BUILD QUALITY WHICH DOES NOT FEEL PREMIUM OR VERY LONG LASTING. IF COMPARED TO THE IPHONE 5 IN TERMS OF BUILD QUALITY, THE S III FEELS VERY FLIMSILY BUILT. BUT, THAT IS DEFINITELY A MATTER OF PERSONAL OPINION ENTIRELY, SINCE INDIVIDUALS PURCHASING PHONES IN THE PRICE RANGE OF THE S III AS PER MY EXPERIENCE DO NOT KEEP THE SAME PHONE FOR MORE THAN 1 YEAR, SO THAT REALLY SHOULD NOT MATTER TO YOU IF YOU DO NOT PLAN TO USE IT TOO ROUGHLY OR MORE THAN 2 YEARS.
      
      
      7.PRICE:
      
      
      WHEN I PURCHASED IT, THE PRICE WAS AT IT'S PEAK AT APPROXIMATELY 35000/- INR, BUT ACCORDING TO IT'S CURRENT PRICE OF AROUND 29500/- INR AS OF FLIPKART, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING, IT IS A VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT ACCORDING TO MY OPINION. IT IS BOUND TO PROVIDE BOTH VERY SEAMLESS, 'BUTTER-SMOOTH' USAGE AND ALSO VERY EXCELLENT BRAND VALUE FOR CUSTOMERS WHO ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT IT. PERSONALLY I VERY MUCH DO CARE ABOUT BRAND VALUE THAT IS. JUST SAYING THAT THE HTC ONE X IS CHEAPER WITH THE SAME FEATURES IS PREPOSTEROUS. THE ONE X AND ONE X+ LACKS THE MUCH BETTER VISUAL INTERFACE OF THE S III, SO PAYING SOME EXTRA MONEY FOR THAT IS JUSTIFIED, FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT HOW THE INTERFACE LOOKS.
      
      
      8.CONCLUSION:
      
      
      THE PHONE IS A PERFECT BLEND OF EVERYDAY USABILITY WITH EXCEPTIONAL FEATURES. I MYSELF NEVER REGRETTED BUYING THE S III. APART FROM THAT, IF THE SCREEN OF THE GALAXY S III SEEMS SMALL, THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE II WILL BE A MORE ATTRACTIVE PHONE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND IF EVEN HIGHER SPECIFICATIONS IN TERMS OF CAMERA ARE REALLY VERY NECESSARY, THE SONY XPERIA SL IS WORTH BUYING WITH IT'S 12MP CAMERA.
      
      
      THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S III IS A PRACTICALLY BUILT PHONE WHICH HAS A VERY JUSTIFIABLE PRICE TAG NOW. SO IF YOU LIKE IT OR LOVE IT, DO NOT WAIT AND JUST GO FOR IT."
Galaxy S3,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 FOR 6 MONTHS NOW, AND NEEDLESS TO SAY, I AM REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE MOST POPULAR SMARTPHONE OF 2012. I AM NOT GOING TO BLABBER ABOUT SPECS AS IT HAS ALREADY BEEN COVERED BY MANY OTHERS. THE DISPLAY IS CRISP AND THE COLOURS JUST POP OUT. I PREFER A BIT OF SATURATION. SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY IS NICE TOO. I AM A TECH GEEK AND RUN 155 APPS ON MY DEVICE. NO LAG AT ALL. AND THE S3 IS ROOT FRIENDLY TOO. ANTUTU FETCHES A SCORE OF 15582 WITHOUT OVERCLOCKING. THE ONLY CON PERHAPS IS LOW AUDIO OUTPUT WHILE LISTENING TO MP3. SONY PHONES ARE THE LOUDER MUSICIANS. YEAH, I WOULD HAVE LOVED A LITTLE JUICIER BATTERY. THE DISPLAY AND WIFI DRAINS BATTERY A BIT FASTER THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED. BUT WITH THE APP GREENIFY, EVEN THAT IS MANAGEABLE. AGAIN, YOU CAN GET A MUGEN 4600 MAH BATTERY OR CARRY A SPARE SAMSUNG ONE. SO NO COMPLAINTS REALLY. AND THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE NEXUS 4 IS BETTER AT THE SAME RANGE, YES IT HAS GOT A SNAPPIER PROCESSOR, MORE RAM; BUT NON-EXPANDABLE MEMORY, NON-REMOVABLE BATTERY AND AVERAGE SERVICEABILITY IN INDIA FOR GOOGLE DEVICES MADE ME OPT FOR S3 INSTEAD. BOTH ARE GOOD PHONES THOUGH, ITS A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE. AND STILL, IF U WANT MORE, XPERIA Z MIGHT BE AN OPTION."
Galaxy S3,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT S3 4 MONTHS BACK AND I AM REALLY VERY MUCH IMPRESSED WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      THE NAME DESIGNED FOR HUMANS IS MUCH SUITABLE FOR THIS PHONE
      
      
      THERE ARE LOT OF POSITIVES FOR THIS
      
      -- EASY TO USE
      
      -- SUPERB CAMERA
      
      -- VIDEO RECORDING IS  TOO GOOD.
      
      
      THE LIST WILL BE VERY HUGE IF I MENTIONED IT HERE. FINALLY THE BEST PHONE AT THIS PRICE AND REALLY WORTH, LOVED IT."
Galaxy S3,5,"I HAVE HAD THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S SERIES SINCE I CAME TO KNEW ABOUT ANDROID POWERED SMARTPHONES. THIS IS THE BEST. IT HAS BEST SOFTWARE AND A GENUINE SAMSUNG TRUST.
      
      
      PROS : CAMERA, DISPLAY, SOFTWARE &AMP; PROCESSOR.
      
      CONS : RAM SHOULD HAVE BEEN 2GB. (NOT THAT 1GB IS LESS BUT S2 HAD 1GB)"
Galaxy S3,5,"I HAVE ORDERED FOR S3 GARNET RED COLOR AS ITS THE CHEAPEST OF OTHER COLORS,DON'T KNOW WHY AT THAT TIME BUT ONCE IT ARRIVED I GOT IT BECAUSE OF OLD MANUFACTURING DATE OF AUG 2012 PRICED AROUND 41K AWW...
      
      IT PRICED ME 27400 WITH CASH BACK AND BLUETOOTH HEADSET , OF COURSE YOU CAN GET IT CHEAPER THAN THIS ON OTHER E COMMERCE SITES LIKE TRADUS AND SHOPCLUES BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WILL RELY ON THEM FOR SUCH PRICED PRODUCT ..NEITHER I HAVE ...
      
      IT WAS ARRIVED BEFORE THE EXPECTED DATE OF DELIVERY ,ONLY DISAPPOINTING THING IS THEY USED FIRST FLIGHT FOR THE SAME , DON'T KNOW WHY ??
      
      THE MOMENT IT COME OUT OF THE BOX YOU WILL FELL IN LOVE WITH IT ...AWESOME ...
      
      I HAVE READ ALL REVIEWS WATCHED VIDEOS ON YOU TUBE EVERYTHING IS THERE ...
      
      WILL NOT COMMENT ON SPECS YOU CAN FIND IT EVERYWHERE...
      
      WILL DEFINITELY COMMENT ON S VOICE FEATURE I ALWAYS HAVE DOUBT IF IT CAN RECOGNIZE THE INDIAN ACCENT BUT IT DOES THAT TOO VERY WELL...
      
      ALSO WHILE TYPING MESSAGE ALSO IT DOES IT 99% CORRECT, IF YOU DON'T FUMBLE IT WILL BE 100%..
      
      YOU CAN REALLY APPLAUD FOR THE SUPER AMOLED SCREEN WHILE WATCHING HD VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE.
      
      WILL DEFINITELY NEVER COMPARE WITH IPHONE OR HTC , ITS ALWAYS YOUR CHOICE WHAT YOU WANT NOT THE BRAND...
      
      I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH IT ...
      
      I F YOU WANT IT JUST GO FOR IT ...FACTS AND FIGURES NEVER TELL LIE ..."
Galaxy S3,5,"I LL JUST JORT DOWN THE CONS OF THE PHONE WHICH I FOUND FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN BOASTING ABOUT ITS PROS, WHICH YOU CAN GET FROM YOUTUBE REVIEWS AND OTHER WEBSITES.
      
      
      1) THE PHONE BACK IS PLASTIC AND SHINY, WHICH MAKES IT SLIPPERY
      
      2) IF THE PHONE FALLS FACING ITS SCREEN, ITS ALMOST SURE THAT IT LL SHATTER, SO THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO AFTER BUYING IT IS TO GET A GOOD CASE THAT PROVIDES ROUND THE BODY PROTECTION, WELL SOME GOOD CASES ARE AVAILABLE  FROM EBAY AND FLIPKART.
      
      3) BATTERY LIFE IS NOT AS GOOD AS I VE EXPECTED FROM A 2100 MAH, FOR MY USE IT LL LAST FOR NOT MORE THAN A DAY(I USE GPS, 3G, CAMERA AND WATCH COUPLE OF HD SONGS EVERYDAY).
      
      4)THE PHONE IS INFACT A BEAST IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, BUT AT TIMES, IT CAN BECOME LIL SLUGGISH WITH MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS RUNNING TOGETHER. SINCE I VE NOT COMPARED IT HAND TO HAND WITH OTHER PHONES IN ITS CLASS, I M NOT COMMENTING MUCH ABOUT IT
      
      5)SCREEN SIZE COULD BE AN ISSUE FOR SOME PEOPLE WITH SMALL HANDS, BUT I WOULD SAY, ITS ALL ABOUT GETTING USED TO !
      
      6)THE PUSH-IN SIM CARD SLOT CAN SOMETIME CREATE PROBLEMS, IF YOU HAVE PUNCHED YOUR OLD MINI-SIM TO MAKE IT INTO A MICRO SIM.
      
      
      THESE ARE THE CONS I PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED. APART FROM THEM, ITS  JUST A AMAZING PIECE OF ENGINEERING. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE OF WHO THINK SMARTPHONE IS LOT MORE THAN JUST PHONING AND MESSAGING, AND USE IT WORTHWHILE!"
Galaxy S3,5,"I PLACED ORDER FOR THIS PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART AFTER AN INTENSE RESEARCH. HERE ARE THE REASONS WHY I  CHOSE THIS-
      
      1. THIS PRODUCT IS THS BEST IN THE MARKET AT THIS PRICE RANGE. THIS NEED NOT BE EXPLAINED FURTHER AS IT IS ALREADY KNOWN TO ALL.
      
      2. YOU ARE GETTING A BLUETOOTH HEADSET AND A 16 GB CARD FOR FREE.
      
      3. IN STORES IT STILL  COSTS 30K.
      
      4. OTHER ONLINE STORES ARE OFFERING JUST THE PHONE AT THE SAME PRICE RANGE.  NO GOODIES.
      
      5. OPTIONS FOR EMI.
      
      6. DELIVERY WAS SUPERB. I PLACED ORDER ON ONE EVENING AT 4 AND GOT IT DELIVERED NEXT MORNING AT 11.
      
      
      SO IN SHORT THIS IS THE BEST DEAL U CAN GET...."
Galaxy S3,5,"I PURCHASED IT LAST WEEK AND ENOYING EVERY MOMENT WITH IT. THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME. CAMERA IS GOOD TOO. THE AMOLED SCREEN IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN LCD SCREEN. I BOUGHT IT FROM THE LOCAL MARKET , GOT IT 1000 RUPEES CHEAPER , BUT FLIPKART IS GIVING THE MEMORY CARD AND THE BLUETOOTH HEADSET WHICH I DIDN'T GET.SO ITS A GOOD DEAL IN FLIPKART TOO. AFTER THE PRICE FALL , KEEPING IN MIND QUALITY AND AFTER SELL SERVICE , IT IS THE BEST IN THIS PRICE RANGE. REALLY LOVING IT.....
      
      
      USING IT FOR 10 DAYS. ITS AWESOME."
Galaxy S3,5,I PURCHASED SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 MOBILE THROUGH FLIPKART ONE WEEK BEFORE.  IT IS VERY WELL PACKED AND MANUFACTURED IN RECENT MONTH. THE GADGETS AND FEATURES OF MOBILE SOUNDS GOOD. THE ONLY ISSUE IS REGARDING CHARGING. IT LAST FOR ONLY 6HRS IF WE USE CONTINUOUSLY(NET &AMP; OTHER APPS). APART FROM THIS THE MOBILE IS SUPERBLY BUILT.
Galaxy S3,5,I PURCHASED THIS ONE MONTH BEFORE IN EMI &AMP; ITS A GREAT PHONE WITH USEFUL FEATURES AND GOT JELLY BEAN UPDATES TOO..GOOD VALUE AFTER THE PRICE CUT AND THE BEST SERVICE FROM FLIPKART AS USUAL...........:)
Galaxy S3,5,"I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET GALAXY S3 AT A MIND BLOWING PRICE OF 28900 WHICH ALSO INCLUDED A BLUE TOOTH HEADSET AND 16 GB SD CARD. I HAD TO PURCHASE FLIP COVER SEPARATELY, BUT IT IS WORTH IT. THE PHONE IS SIMPLY GREAT AND WAS DELIVERED UNDER COD IN PERFECT CONDITIONS.
      
      
      COUPLE'O TIPS--
      
      
      IF YOU HAVE REGULAR SIM, GO TO SOME MOBILE GALLERY [BIG STORE DON'T DO THIS] AND HAVE THEM CUT REGULAR SIM INTO SMALLER ONE [THERE ARE TWO VARIANTS, MICRO AND MINI, TELL THE GALLERY PERSON, YOU WANT IT CUT FOR GALAXY S3]. ALSO PUT A SCREEN GUARD AND PREFERABLY A FLIP COVER [BEST FOR SEVERAL REASONS, THE BACK SIDE SIMPLY REPLACES THE BACK COVER OF THE PHONE].
      
      
      UPDATE YOUR OS, CURRENT UPDATE IS 4.1.2 ANDROID.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS JUST GREAT- CHECK ANY OF CNET, GADEGT.COM, AND TONS OTHER TECH SITES FOR REVIEWS OF GALAXY S3.
      
      
      THANKS FLIPKART FOR THIS THING.!!"
Galaxy S3,5,"IT DEFINITELY GIVES THE USER MORE CONTROL OVER THE DEVICE, THAN ANY OTHER PHONE!! AND THE PRICE IS VERY REASONABLE AS WELL........
      
      
      AND IT IS NOW UPGRADABLE TO JELLY BEAN, WHICH IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVICE.."
Galaxy S3,5,"IT IS THE BEST MOBILE I HAVE EVER USED,N IT'S CAMERA N MUSIC CLARITY ARE JUST AWESOME
      
      IT HAS AN AMAZING DISPLAY,IT HOLDS PERFECT TO MY HAND,ALL MOST ALL GAMES RUN VERY SMOOTHLY WITHOUT ANY LAG,BATTERY BACK UP IS VERY GOOD ,SAMSUNG'S TOUCHWIZ UI IS THE BEST"
Galaxy S3,5,"IT WAS AN AWESOME PRODUCT ON SAMSUNG.HIGH PERFORMANCE SMART PHONE WITH A REASONABLE PRICE.
      
      
      PROS
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY WAS SO GUD.
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS UPTO THE LEVEL.
      
      DISPLAY IS AMOLED WITH GREAT EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      CONS
      
      SUCH AS LIGHT WEIGHTED IN YOUR POCKET U DONNO WHERE YOU LEFT YOUR PHONE. :P, NO CONS FOR THIS PRODUCT. REALLY WORTHFULL."
Galaxy S3,5,"IT'S A DECENT POWER PACKED PHONE. I UPGRADED FROM S2 TO S3. CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. GO FOR IT. THE DISPLAY IS ONE OF THE THE BEST DISPLAYS RIGHT NOW IN THE MARKET, PERIOD. SUPER AMOLEDS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR RICH COLORS AND DEEP BLACKS, AND TRUST ME, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT IF YOU HAVEN?T ALREADY. THE BLACKS ARE IMPENETRABLE, AND COLORS POP OUT TO THE EYES. YOU CAN TWEAK DISPLAY SETTINGS IF YOU LIKE MORE NATURAL LOOKING COLORS. FINALLY, THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE PENTILE NATURE OF THE DISPLAY, DON'T BE. AT PIXEL DENSITY OF 306 PPI, YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE THE GRAININESS IN DAY TO DAY USE THAT WAS PREVALENT ON GALAXY S, UNLESS YOU SEE FROM VERY CLOSE RANGE.
      
      THE ICS 4.0.4 UI IS SKINNED BY SAMSUNG TOUCHWIZ NATURE UX. THIS IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT TOUCHWIZ USED TO BE COUPLE OF YEARS BACK, AND REALLY BRINGS A FRESH FEEL TO USER EXPERIENCE, NOT VERY VISUALLY APPEALING AS HTC SENSE, BUT NOT BAD EITHER."
Galaxy S3,5,ITS REALLY AN AWESOME MOBILE AND TO OWN IT MAKES ONE FEEL VERY GREAT. THIS IS MY FIRST PURCHASE THROUGH FLIPKART AND I HOPE THEY DELIVER IT VERY SOON SO THAT I CAN HAVE MY HANDS ON THE LOVEABLE S3. WAITING FOR IT.
Galaxy S3,5,"IVE BEEN USING THE S3 FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS PHONE IS UNBELIEVABLE.  FOR SOMEONE WHOS BIN AN APPLE FANBOY N WHOS LAST PHONE WAS A 4S THIS IS A BIG THING TO SAY. BELIEVE ME THE PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF CAMERA, CPU, GAMING, PROCESSOR PERFORMANCE IS UNBEATABLE. PLUS U NOW HAVE THE JELLYBEAN UPDATE FOR S3. THIS PHONE HAS SO MANY CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS ITS MIND BOGGLING. BE IT SHARING STUFF WITH OTHERS OR FROM A PENDRIVE OR THROUGH A HDMI CABLE. ITS A BEAUTIFUL DEVICE THAT U WILL NEVER REGRET OWNING BELIEVE U ME. ITS AWESOME N THE APPS AVAILABLE ON THE PLAY STORE ITS CRAZY MAN. U CAN DOWNLOAD AN APP FOR DOWNLOADIBG MOVIES, SONGS GAMES ETC. I EVEN PUT IN A 64 GB MEMORY CARD IN MY DEVICE..WORKS LIKE A CHARM. DON NEED ANYTHING ELSE FOR MY COMMUNICATION OR ENTERTAINMENT NEEDS.HOPE U ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DO. I HAVE A WHITE WITH A BLACK SILICON COVER N LOVING IT."
Galaxy S3,5,I'VE PLACED AN ORDER FOR THIS MOBILE COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK. THE ORDER WAS DELIVERED ONE DAY BEFORE THE EXPECTED DELIVERY RATE. THE GADGET IS WORKING WELL AND ALSO THE FREEBIES. BUT THE PRICE HAS BEEN INCREASED A BIT HIGH NOW BUT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND PLACE THE ORDER FOR THIS MOBILE WITHOUT ANY WORRIES.
Galaxy S3,5,"MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT ONCE YOU USE IPHONE YOU WONT LOOK AT ANY OTHER DEVICE.
      
      NOW I DISAGREE WITH THEM. THIS IS ONE ONE THE BEST PRODUCT SAMSUNG HAS LAUNCHED. I WONT MENTION ANY SPECS OR OTHER DETAILS HERE AS YOU GUYS CAN FIGURE IT OUT BY OTHER REVIEWS.
      
      IF YOU ARE A READER KINDA PERSON AND STILL DONT WANNA CARRY A TABLET, THIS IS ONE DEVICE FOR YOU. FAST PROCESSING MAKES PLAYING GAMES A WAY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE.
      
      IF YOU ARE SEMI-PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER AND ONE WHO DONT CARRY DIGITAL CAMERA EVERYWHERE, DONT WORRY, S3'S CAMERA IS MUCH ADVANCED AND GIVES BETTER RESULTS THAN MOST OF THE DIGITAL CAMERAS IN THE MARKET.
      
      
      THANKS FOR FLIPKART FOR PROVIDING GOOD SERVICE AND REALLY GOOD CUSTOMER CARE SUPPORT TO HELP SOLVE MY QUERIES AND TRACK SHIPMENT."
Galaxy S3,5,"NOW THE PRICE HAS COME DOWN AFTER LAUNCH OF S4, SO ITS THE BEST BET.GO FOR BEST QUALITY CAMERA,SOUND,PROCESSOR,TOUCH &AMP; SLEEK FEEL IN SAMSUNG GALAXY S3.INCASE IF YOU WISH TO BUY USED PIECE THINK AND COMPARE WITH EMI OPTION"
Galaxy S3,5,"ONE WORD IS ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PHONE. IT IS ULTRA SMOOTH, HANDY AND USER FRIENDLY. LG (LIFE'S GOOD) AFTER THIS PURCHASE. AND WITH THE CURRENT OFFER OF 15% OFF IT IS A STEAL. ALSO THIS PHONE IS NOT MADE IN CHINA AS MANY OTHER PHONES BUT IT IS VERY MUCH MADE IN INDIA. I GUESS THAT'S THE DISCOUNT IS POSSIBLE. VERY GOOD QUALITY AND FEATURES. LOVE THE DECISION TO PURCHASE THIS PHONE. THANKS"
Galaxy S3,5,"OUT OF THE 5 MONTHS USAGE OF MY SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 ...!!!! JUST WANNA SAY THIS GUYS. SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 JUST ROCKS, AWESOME ...!!!!! MAYBE FOR THE ONES WHO HAS ALREADY USED S2 ; S3 IS NOT A RIGHT CHOICE, SIMILARLY IF SOMEONE IS USED TO S3 PLEASE DON GO FOR S4. WAIT FOR THE OFFICIAL UPDATE FROM SAMSUNG TO THE JELLY BEAN 4.2 AND ALSO THE PROMISED KEY LIME PIE UPDATE TOO..!!!!! THEN PROBALY DECIDE OR NOT TO UPGRADE TO YOUR S3 TO S4.
      
      
      BUT MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE PLEASE WAIT FOR AN INNOVATED PHONE FROM SAMSUNG AND NOT TO BUY AN UPGRADED PHONE S4 (HOPING S5 WOULD BE AN INNOVATED ONE)
      
      
      CANT WAIT FOR IT GUYS, HOPING SAMSUNG RELEASES THE OFFICIAL UPDATES ASAP TO GET MY BEAST UNLEASHED.. !!!!!"
Galaxy S3,5,"PLEASE DO NOT GET MISUNDERSTOOD THAT SAMSUNG HAS DONE WRONG IN INDIA BY RELEASING 1GB RAM VARIANT OF S3
      
      S3 HAS TWO VARIANTS
      
      1) QUAD CORE PROCESSOR WITH 1 GB RAM  (INDIA VERSION)
      
      2)DUAL CORE PROCESSOR WITH 2 GB RAM (US CANADA)
      
      REST CONFIGURATION IS SAME IN BOTH"
Galaxy S3,5,PRODUCT IS GOOD AS SHOWN IN ON-LINE.  I CERTAINLY HAVE FAITH AND NO DUPLICATION AT ALL.  I HAVE USED THE PRODUCT AND WORKING WELL WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.  I SUGGEST YOU TO PROVIDE A SUITABLE GENUINE LEATHER POUCHES TO THIS KIND OF PHONES FOR BETTER PROTECTION WITH EXTRA CHARGE.

Galaxy S3,5,"PURCHASED THIS PHONE ABOUT A WEEK BACK AND AM STILL FALLING IN LOVE WITH IT EVERYDAY...
      
      A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT BY SAMSUNG SPECIALLY AT THE PRICE POINT. I GOT AN ADDITIONAL 5% DISCOUNT THANKS TO FLIPKART, WHICH WAS LIKE AN ICING ON THE CAKE. GOOD SERVICE FROM FLIPKART YET AGAIN, ALTHOUGH THIS TIME THEY DID NOT DELIVER THE PRODUCT AS FAST AS THEY HAD DELIVERED THE OTHER ITEMS I HAD PURCHASED BEFORE.
      
      
      NOW ON THE PHONE -
      
      
      PROS -
      
      1. GREAT DISPLAY.
      
      2. EXCELLENT CAMERA.
      
      3. VERY RESPONSIVE TOUCH-SCREEN WITH GORILLA GLASS WHICH IS SCRATCH RESISTANT.
      
      4. SUPERB AUDIO-QUALITY, THE INCLUDED HEADSET WORKS LIKE A CHARM, YOU BASICALLY DON'T NEED TO OPT FOR VERY HIGH END ONES TILL THIS LAST. THE LOUDSPEAKER IS GOOD ENOUGH.
      
      5. PERFORMANCE WISE THERE ARE NO COMPLAINTS. SUPER-FAST PERFORMANCE AND ALL THE GAMES THAT I HAVE TRIED HAVE WORKED FINE. CALL QUALITY IS EXCELLENT.
      
      6. WATCHING YOU-TUBE VIDEOS OR BROWSING THE NET IS A REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE ON THIS PHONE.
      
      7. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY GOOD. EASILY LASTS ONE WHOLE DAY AND SOMETIMES EVEN MORE THAN THAT FOR ME.
      
      
      CONS -
      
      1. A BIT TOO LARGE.
      
      2. FOR PEOPLE WITH THICKER FINGERS LIKE ME, TYPING ON THE KEYBOARD IS VERY DIFFICULT IN PORTRAIT MODE. I HAVE TO TURN THE PHONE TO LANDSCAPE MODE TO TYPE.
      
      3. ONE OR TWO APPS CRASHED WITHOUT ANY REASON.
      
      4. LOUDSPEAKER COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LOUDER.
      
      5. THE DEFAULT BACK COVER IS VERY VERY FLIMSY. I WAS ACTUALLY SCARED OF IT BREAKING BY ACCIDENT. I WOULD SUGGEST PEOPLE TO BUY A FLIP-COVER SEPARATELY.
      
      6. INCLUDED HEADPHONES ARE WHITE IN COLOR. THIS IS NOT A CON EXACTLY BUT I DID NOT LIKE IT. WHITE HEADPHONES GET DIRTY EASILY.
      
      
      ONE MORE THING FOR GUYS WHO ARE SAD THAT THEY DON'T HAVE AN S4...DON'T WORRY A FIRMWARE UPGRADE IS SOON COMING (VER - 4.2.2) WITH MANY OF THE FEATURES (SOFTWARE) THAT ARE THERE IN S4...SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING RIGHT !!!!"
Galaxy S3,5,"S3 THE PHONE REALLY IMPRESSED ME . AWESOME TOUCH N BETTER UI. FASTER CAMERA,BATTERY BACKUP LONGLAST 2 DAYS HEAVY USAGE ONE DAY S WITHSTANDING.  ONE THING SAMSUNG NOT YET IMPROVED THE CAMERA IF JUST SHAKED THE PICTURES NOT  FOCUSED WELL. BUT ALL OTHER THINGS R IMPRESSED ME. NICE WORK BY SAMSUNG. THANKS TO FLIPKART AND I REQUEST U TO DON'T DISPATCH THROUGH FIRST FLIGHT THEY R NOT DELIVERING QUICKLY THEIR SERVICE S WORST. DISPATCH THROUGH BLUEDART"
Galaxy S3,5,"SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS THE BEST SMARTPHONE AVAILABLE AT PRESENT..
      
      FLIPKART DELIVERED IT IN 2 WORKING DAYS.. SERVICE IS SUPERB!!..
      
      
      S3 IS VALUE FOR MONEY.. GREAT SPEED..SUPERB CAMERA..A GOOD BATTERY LIFE!!..
      
      
      ..IF U WANT THE BEST ANDROID PHONE TILL NOW.. GO FOR IT WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED.. :)"
Galaxy S3,5,"THE PHONE IS AN ABSOLUTE STUNNER BOTH ON LOOKS AND SPECS.IT HAS BEEN BEST ANDROID PHONE IN WORLD FOR NO REASON. EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT GALAXY S3. I RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.
      
      AND AS ALWAYS FLIPKART SERVICE IS THE BEST I HAVE EXPERIENCED."
Galaxy S3,5,"THE PHONE IS BY FAR THE BEST SMARTPHONE I HAVE PURCHASED TILL DATE. IT DELIVERS WHAT IT PROMISES WHICH IS SOLID RAW POWER, MOST APPLICATION AND GAMES WORK ON THE DEVICE QUITE WELL. IT RUN ON ANDROID 4.0.4 (ICS) AND CAN BE UPGRADED TO 4.1.2 (JELLY BEAN). THE TOUCH IS VERY FAST AND VERY RESPONSIVE.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS QUITE POPULAR AND HENCE YOU CAN FIND A NUMBER OF ROOT, ROM AND DEVICE HACKS ON XDA.
      
      
      THE PHONE HAS A VERY BALANCED WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION AND HAS A NICE FEEL.
      
      
      NOW, FOR THE CONS
      
      
      THE BATTERY LAST FOR A DAY WITH NORMAL DAILY USE. ON STANDBY IT WILL LAST FOR 2-3 DAYS. AND ON GAMING THE BATTERY WILL GIVE HALF-A-DAY MAX. NOTICED THE PHONE HEATING UP DURING HEAVY USE (WHICH IS GAMING).
      
      
      FOR PEOPLE WITH BATTERY ISSUES I WOULD SUGGEST GOING FOR ZEROLEMON SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 7000MAH BATTERY PACK. SADLY NOT AVAILABLE IN INDIA (PLEASE NOTE IT DOES ADD ADDITIONAL WEIGHT AND MAKES THE PHONE BIT BULKY)"
Galaxy S3,5,"THE PHONE IS REALLY SUPERB.....I GOT IT ON APRIL 11TH FROM CHENNAI UNIVERCELL(SORRY TO FLIPKART)....BEFORE BUYING THIS MOBILE I HAVE SONY XPERIA GO..............THE PHONE WHICH SOLD FROM SONY IS REALLY SUCKS......STUPID PRODUCT FROM SONY..........WITHIN 6 MONTHS THE ENTIRE PHONE IS GONE..SOFTWARE PROBLEM AND TOUCH ENTIRELY WASTE......SO I TRIED TO SWICTH OVER WITH SAMSUNG...AFTER A BIG COMPETITION I BOUGHT S3...SINCE THESE PHONE IS USED BY MY FRIEND FOR PAST 10 MONTHS........HE WILL PLAY GAMES MOST OF TIMES...ALWAYS HIS MOBILE IS IN INTERNET....HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THIS MOBILE.............I ALSO DONT HAVE THE PROBLE, WITH S3....CAMERA QUALITY AND QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AND 1GB RAM IS REALLY AWESOME................. BLINDLY ALL CAN PURCHASE THIS PHONE....COST OF THE PHONE IS HIGH.......IT IS REALLY WORTH FOR THAT MONEY.................AWESOME AWESOME....................THANKS TO SAMSUNG ONCE AGAIN................................."
Galaxy S3,5,"THE S3 HAS A 4.8IN DISPLAY AND IT'S CERTAINLY BIG. IT?S A SLIM PHONE FROM FRONT TO BACK SO IT?S MORE MANAGEABLE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK, BUT EVEN SO.
      
      ACTUALLY, WHAT HELPS MORE IN TERMS OF COMFORT IS THE GLOSS FINISH. IT?S LIKE A SMOOTH, FLAT WHITE STONE THAT YOU CAN ROLL SEAMLESSLY THROUGH YOUR FINGERS. A MATTE FINISH WOULDN?T HAVE FELT AS GOOD.
      
      ANYWAYS ITS GOOD ..
      
      
      PROS-
      
      
      1. THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 BOASTS ITS QUAD CORE PROCESSOR. THIS MEANS SUPERB GRAPHICS CAN BE VIEWED IN ITS AMAZING SCREEN. SO FAR AMONG ALL THE SAMSUNG SMARTPHONES, THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET IN TERMS OF SCREEN RESOLUTION.
      
      2. SO MUCH IS PACKED IN ITS SLIM FORM, CONSIDERING ALSO THAT ITS QUAD CORE.
      
      AMAZING QUALITY OF CAMERA(ICS) THAT CAN BE COMPARED TO IPHONE?S.
      
      3 .A WIDE ARRAY OF CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY SITUATION.
      
      4. A BIG UPGRADE ON THE FIELD OF SOFTWARE THAT?S REALLY A BIG LEAP FROM THE PREVIOUS PHONES OF SAMSUNG.
      
      5. THE REMOVABLE BATTERY IS A BIG PLUS BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE THE OPTION TO BUY ANOTHER BATTERY ONCE THE ORIGINAL STARTS ACTING UP WITHOUT HASSLE. UNLIKE OTHER PHONES WITH BUILT-IN BATTERIES.
      
      6.DEVELOPER OPTIONS AVAILABLE.
      
      7.CREATED WITH BEST INNOVATIVE IDEAS .
      
      
      CONS-
      
      
      1.GETS HEATED UP QUICKLY AND THE BAD THING IS THAT YOU CAN FEEL IT.
      
      2.SHAPE AND DESIGN COULD BE MUCH MORE BETTER.
      
      3.CAMERA QUALITY GETS FREAKED AFTER THE JELLY BEAN UPDATE(4.1.1) AND PROBLEMS OCCUR SOMETIMES IN KEY PADS(SO BETTER DONT GO FOR THE UPDATE).
      
      
      "" BE CAREFULL "" SEEN A LOT OF GUYS DROPPED THE PHONE AND CRACKED THE SCREEN ; ITS FRAGILE LIKE THAT.
      
      
      OVERALL BEST... GO FOR IT (A PERFORMANCE + GAMING PHONE AS WELL)
      
      AND GUYS OUT THERE"" A HUMBLE REQUEST TO YOU ALL . PLEASE DON'T COMPARE THE S3 WITH A MICROMAX OR XOLO OR ANY DOWNGRADE MODEL"". AND PLZ DON'T BE FOOLISH."
Galaxy S3,5,"THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS QUITE SIMPLY THE BEST ANDROID SMARTPHONE YOU CAN BUY AT THIS PRICE RIGHT NOW. IT?S FAST, HAS AN AMAZING SCREEN, LOTS OF EXTRA FEATURES, A CRACKING CAMERA, AND EXCELS IN ALMOST EVERY AREA.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
Galaxy S3,5,"THIS IS MY FIRST SAMSUNG AND I MUST SAY I AM IMPRESSED.
      
      EARLIER I DIDNT FIND SAMSUNG MUCH INTRESTING BUT THEN THESE DAYS ITS AMONG THE BEST.
      
      COMING TO PHONE ITS BEEN MORE THAN 20 DAYS I AM USING THIS BEAST AND IT SERVES ALMOST ALL PURPOSES GAMES,VIDEOS,APPS ALL CPU HUNGRY WORTH WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.
      
      TOUCH RESPONSE IS SUPERB,CAM IS PRETTY GOOD TOO(BETTER THAN THE 13MP ON OPTIMUS G)
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS ALSO IMPRESSIVE IT WILL LAST ONE DAY APPROX WITH ALL USAGE.
      
      ITS OLD NOW BUT YOU CANT IGNORE THE FACT IT IS THE BEST AND SO IT IS STILL SO POPULAR AND IN DEMAND AND THIS THE REASON FLIPKART'S PRICE IS SO HIGH.
      
      NOW MANY PEOPLE MUST BE THINKING WHY TO BUY A OLD PHONE WHEN NEW ONES MORE ATTRACTIVE ARE AVAILABLE AT SIMILAR PRICES, SO THE ANSWER IS SAMSUNG HAS ITS OWN CHERRY ON ITS CAKE IT HAS OPTIMISED THE UI WITH INTRESTING FEATURES WHICH YOU CANT GET WITH OTHER BRANDS.
      
      IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR LOOKS CHOOSE OTHER BRANDS BUT IF YOU WANT THE MOST OF YOUR MONEY GO WITH S3 IT SURELY WONT DISSAPOINT YOU :)"
Galaxy S3,5,"THIS IS SAMSUNG'S FLAGSHIP MODEL AND REALLY LIVES UPTO HYPE.
      
      PROS-
      
      QUAD CORE PROCESSOR.FULLY FUTURE PROOF.NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT APP COMPATIBILITY
      
      1.9MP FRONT CAMERA
      
      SUPER AMOLED
      
      4.8 INCH SCREEN
      
      MALI 400MP GPU - THE TOP OF THE LINE GRAPHICS PROCESSOR FOR SMARTPHONES
      
      GREAT BATTERY BACKUP
      
      
      CONS -
      
      CHEAP OLD PLASTIC BUILD SEEMS LIKE ITS BECOMING A TRAEMARK FOR SAMSUNG
      
      
      COMPARISON WITH ONE X
      
      HTC ONE X IS CLOCKED 0 .1GHZ FASTER THAN S3 AND WHEN YOU MULTIPLAY IT BY THE AMOUNT OF CORES YOU GET 0.1 X 4 = 0.4 GHZ WHICH IS ROUGHLY 400MHZ FASTER THAN THE S3.
      
      S3 HAS EXPANDABLE MEMORY UPTO 64GIGS WHICH IS WAY BETTER THAN BEING LIMITED TO 32 GIGS OF ONE X.
      
      S3 HAS MALI 400MP WHILE ONE X HAS ULP GEFORCE.MALI 400MP WILL PROVIDE BETTER GAMING BENCHMARKS SO THEREFORE FOR GAMING S3 TRIUMPHS OVER ONE X (YOU CAN LOOK IT UP ON GOOGLE IF YOU WANT)
      
      ONE X HAS 1.3 MP FRONT CAM WHILE S3 HAS 1.9 SO BETTER VIDEO CALLING QUALITY FOR YAHOO AND SKYPE.
      
      SUPER AMOLED IS BETTER THAN SUPER LCD EVEN IN SUNLIGHT.PLEASE DON'T BE MISGUIDED
      
      S3 HAS 0.1 INCH BIGGER SCREEN THAN THAT OF ONE X
      
      ONE X HAS A BETTER UI (SENSE) THAN S3 (TOUCHWIZ).
      
      SO ALL IN ALL S3 HAS MORE PLUSES THAN ONE X SO ITS CLEAR THAT S3 STOMPS ONE X.
      
      THANK YOU FOR READING,
      
      HOPE I HELPED :)."
Galaxy S3,5,"THIS IS THE BEST HANDSET AVAILABLE AT THIS PRICE RANGE.I BOUGHT THE PEBBLE BLUE,NOT FROM FLIPKART FOR 28K.
      
      PRO'S=SCREEN,LOOKS(PERSONAL),CPU GPU(BOTH ONE OF THE BEST),ROM SUPPORT(NO OTHER HANDSET HAS THIS MUCH SUPPORT)
      
      CON'S=AS OF NOW NOTHING"
Galaxy S3,5,"THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME PHONE IN THIS RANGE AND NOT TO MENTION FLIPKART AS USUAL IS THE BEST ONLINE STORE TO BUY ANY OF THE PRODUCTS. FLIPKART HAVE DELIVERED ME MY PHONE IN JUST 2.5 WORKING DAYS AND THAT MAKES THIS REALLY AWESOME.
      
      
      SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS THE MUST AND BEST BUY PHONE IF YOU WISH TO HAVE THE POWER OF SMART PHONE IN YOUR HAND. AND IF YOU ARE BUYING IT FLIPKART IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BUY AS NO ONE ELSE CAN GIVE YOU THE BEST PRODUCT AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE PRICE IN THE MARKET."
Galaxy S3,5,"THOUGH I DID NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART, I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE NOVEMBER,2012.
      
      HOPEFULLY, MY REVIEW CAN CLEAR ANY DOUBT ONE HAS REGARDING THE PHONE.
      
      
      THE REVIEW HAS VARIOUS SEGMENTS. SO IF YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING PARTICULAR, YOU CAN SKIP DIRECTLY TO IT.
      
      
      THE NEXT GEN FROM SAMSUNG IS ALREADY HERE. THE GALAXY SIV HAS ARRIVED AND IS PRICED AT RS. 41500. BUT THE SIII IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN A PHONE.
      
      
      LOOK &AMP; DESIGN:
      
      THE SIII HAVING A 4.8"" SCREEN IS CERTAINLY NOT COMPACT, BUT IT NEITHER IS TOO HEAVY WEIGHING JUST 133G. SO IT CERTAINLY WILL BE FELT IN YOUR POCKET.
      
      THE DESIGN TAKES A THING OR TWO FROM THE DESIGN OF THE GALAXY NEXUS BUT HAS BEEN GIVEN A REALLY SLIM WAISTLINE WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE. THE MATERIALS USED GIVE IT A STURDY BUILD BUT HAS A DELICATE LOOK. HAVING DROPPED IT A FEW TIMES, I HAVEN'T HAD ANY DAMAGE ON THE PHONE TILL NOW. THE HYPERGLAZE COATING ON THE BACK PREVENTS SOME FINGERPRINTS AND ALSO GIVES A DECENT GRIP.
      
      
      SCREEN:
      
      THE 4.8"" SUPER AMOLED 720P DISPLAY IS AMAZING. THE IMAGE QUALITY IS AGAIN IMPRESSIVE WITH PERFECT BLACKS. THE DISPLAY IS CRISP AND THERE IS ALSO AN OPTION IN THE DISPLAY SETTINGS IF YOU WANT THE COLORS TO BE MORE DYNAMIC AND COLORFUL.
      
      SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY IS REALLY GOOD TOO, SO PEOPLE CAN SEE THE SCREEN QUITE CLEARLY ON THE SUNNIEST DAY.
      
      
      BATTERY:
      
      AS THEY SAY ""KITNA DETI HAI?"" WELL THE ANSWER IS NOT THAT BAD. I GET AROUND A DAY WITH MODERATE USE. FROM LISTENING TO MUSIC, MESSAGING, WATCHING VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE, CALLS ETC. THE PHONE IS GOOD AND ALSO HAS AN OPTION OF A REPLACEABLE BATTERY. SO YOU CAN CARRY AN EXTRA BATTERY.
      
      
      PROCESSOR, RAM ETC.:
      
      SAMSUNG USED ITS OWN EXYNOS 4412 QUAD PROCESSOR FOR THE GALAXY S3, A QUAD-CORE CHIP. IT'S CLOCKED AT 1.4GHZ AND IS BASED ON THE ARM CORTEX-A9 ARCHITECTURE. THE CHIP COMES WITH 1GB RAM WHICH IS GOOD COMPARED TO THE OTHER PHONES AND A MALI 400 GPU WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH TO PLAY MOST GAMES OUT THERE WITHOUT ANY HICCUPS
      
      
      USER INTERFACE:
      
      SAMSUNG WITH THEIR TOUCHWIZ INTERFACE HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB, IT IS NOOB FRIENDLY AND ALSO HAS QUITE SOME ADVANCED OPTIONS TOO. THE INTERFACE IS GOOD COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES.
      
      
      PHONEBOOK, CALLING, MESSAGING:
      
      THE PHONEBOOK IS SIMPLE &AMP; EFFICIENT. SWIPING LEFT ON THE CONTACT ALLOWS YOU TO SEND A MESSAGE WHEREAS SWIPING RIGHT ALLOWS YOU TO CALL. IT IS THE LITTLE THINGS WHICH MAKES THE DIFFERENCE.
      
      CALL QUALITY IS GOOD. NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. CONTACTS CAN BE ASSIGNED CUSTOM VIBRATION PATTERNS . SO DIFFERENT VIBRATION PATTERNS CAN BE ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
      
      MESSAGING IS A BREEZE ON THE PHONE. HAVING A GREAT SCREEN, SAMSUNG HAS DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THE KEYBOARD WHICH ALSO HAS A FUNCTION LIKE SWYPE(THE KEYBOARD APP) AND IS VERY ACCURATE. THE KEYBOARD ALSO LEARNS FROM YOUR STYLE OF TYPING WHAT WORDS YOU USE MOST AFTER CERTAIN WORDS AND PUTS RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE YOU TYPE THE NEXT WORD, WHICH IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.
      
      
      MUSIC PLAYER:
      
      DOES A VERY GOOD JOB OF A MUSIC PLAYER, HAS EQUALIZER PRESETS INCLUDING A CUSTOM ONE AND ALSO USES SOUNDALIVE TECHNOLOGY.
      
      ALSO HAS SOMETHING CALLED MUSIC SQUARE WHICH SORTS MUSIC ACCORDING THE THE MOOD OF THE USER.
      
      
      VIDEO PLAYER:
      
      THE BEST STOCK VIDEO PLAYER THERE IS. I HAVEN'T SEEN A DEFAULT VIDEO PLAYER THAT HANDLES SO MANY FORMATS EFFORTLESSLY. THE GRID MODE IN VIEWING VIDEOS IS JUST BRILLIANT WHERE THE THUMBNAILS ARE ACTUALLY BEING PLAYED INSTEAD OF A SINGLE IMAGE. THE PROPER USE OF THE PROCESSOR.
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      I DEFINITELY LOVE THE CAMERA. IT'S NOT THE BEST IN THE MARKET BUT IT IS GOOD ENOUGH. LOADS OF CAMERA MODES OUT AND THE 4.1.2 UPDATE INCLUDED A LOW LIGHT MODE WHICH DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF CLICKING IMAGES IN LOW LIGHT. THE DEFAULT CAMERA IS NOT THAT GREAT BUT USING APPS SUCH AS CAMERA 360 ULTIMATE AND PUDDING CAMERA MAKE THE CAMERA EXPERIENCE AN AMAZING ONE.
      
      BUT IF YOU WANT A PHONE FOR THE STOCK CAMERA, THE LUMIA 920 IS THE BEST I HAVE SEEN.
      
      
      VIDEO RECORDING IS ALSO TOP NOTCH, THE CAMERA IS CAPABLE OF RECORDING FULLHD VIDEOS WITH 30FPS AND YOU CAN SNAP PHOTOS WHILE VIDEO RECORDING.
      
      
      OTHERS:
      
      
      THE WEB BROWSER IS BRILLIANT. NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD ANOTHER WEB BROWSER FROM THE PLAY STORE.
      
      APPS SUCH AS POLARIS OFFICE WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR FREE IN THE SAMSUNG STORE MAKE EDITING WORD, EXCEL FILES A REALLY EASY THING.
      
      THERE IS AN S-MEMO APP WHICH ACTS LIKE A STICKY NOTE FOR THE SMALL LIL THINGS.
      
      
      WITH THE RELEASE OF THE 4.1.2 UPDATE, FEATURES LIKE MULTI-WINDOW( SCREEN SPLITS INTO HALF AND TWO TASKS SIMULTANEOUSLY CAN BE USED) AND PAGE BUDDY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED.
      
      
      CONSIDERING CUSTOM ROMS, GALAXY SIII IS ONE OF THE MOST SUPPORTED PHONES ON XDA DEVELOPERS WITH ALMOST A NEW CUSTOM ROM BEING RELEASED EVERY DAY.
      
      
      COMPARED TO THE SIV, I PERSONALLY WOULD STICK WITH THE SIII SINCE I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS ANYTHING WHICH FULLY UTILIZES THE QUAD CORE. AND THE FEATURES OF THE SIV SUCH AS SMART SCROLL ETC. ARE SCHEDULED TO BE IN THE NEXT UPDATE FOR THE GALAXY SIII.
      
      
      CONCLUSION:
      
      I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO WRONG WITH CHOOSING THE SIII. IT STILL IS ONE OF THE BEST PHONES IN THE MARKET EVEN TODAY."
Galaxy S3,5,"TO START OFF I CURRENTLY OWN THE 16 GB PEBBLE BLUE VERSION OF THE PHONE FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND IT IS REALLY A COOL DEVICE.HAVING OWNED THE XPERIA RAY BEFORE, THIS PHONE WAS DEFINITELY A STEP UP.THE SCREEN IS AMAZING. APPS RUN SMOOTHLY, ITS VERY FAST, LIGHT, AND IT IS HARD TO PUT THE THING DOWN. IT IS A GREAT DEVICE AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT MY DECISION TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S3,5,"US EDITION S-3 IS BLOCKBUSTER PHONE.
      
      
      1.5 GHZ DUAL-CORE KRAIT CPU, ADRENO 225 GPU, QUALCOMM MSM8960 SNAPDRAGON CHIPSET, 2GB OF RAM
      
      
      PRETTY FAST AND COMPLEMENT TO NOTE-2
      
      
      AFTER THE BRAIN TRANSPLANT REQUIRED FOR THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S III TO JUMP THE BIG POND, THE SMARTPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT HAS BECOME LOUDER, BUT ISN'T AS CLEAR AS ON THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION.
      
      THIS MAKES THE US SAMSUNG GALAXY S III ONE OF THE LOUDER SMARTPHONES AROUND AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT HAS STILL RETAINED ITS SPOTLESS FREQUENCY RESPONSE. THE SIGNAL/NOISE RATIO AND DYNAMIC RANGE READINGS HAVE DETERIORATED SLIGHTLY, BUT THEY ARE STILL PRETTY GREAT AND SO ARE THE DISTORTION LEVELS. SOME EXTRA STEREO CROSSTALK HAS CREPT IN, BUT THE SCORE IS HARDLY MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT."
Galaxy S3,5,"WHEN I SAW 14TH MARCH EVENT (GS4 LAUNCH) , THAT DAY DECIDED TO GO FOR GS3. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW OLNY 8 CORE PROCESSOR &AMP; FULL HD SCREEN ARE CONSIDERABLE NEW THINGS. BUT IS IT REALLY REQUIRED? STILL WORLDS BEST PHONE ON QUAD CORE (HTC ONE, XPERIA Z).
      
      PHONEARENA ALREADY SAYS THAT GS3 WILL GET ALL THE SOFTWARE PACKAGES ( S HEALTH, SMART PAUSE.. AND SO ON) OF GS4 IN UPCOMING UPDATES.
      
      ALSO SAMSUNG CONFIRMED THAT GS3 WIIL GATE ANDROID 5.0 KEY LIME PIE.
      
      
      SO GUYS BUYING GS3@ ?30345 IS REALLY WORTHY. DON'T MISS THIS PIECE OF CAKE ."
Galaxy S3,5,"WHY IS THIS CHEAPER THAN PEBBLE BLUE VERSION?
      
      
      THE PEBBLE BLUE IS RS RS. 30345 AND THE RED VERSION IS RS. 28500. WHY IS THIS SO? SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER. IS THERE SOME PROBLEM WITH THE RED VERSION?
      
      
      I AM PLANNING TO BUY A S3 AND THIS IS NAGGING MY BRAIN. THE PRICE DIFFERENCE.
      
      
      IS IT AN ERROR BY FLIPKART?"
Galaxy S3,5,"WOW !! I MUST SAY.. HATS OFF TO THE FLIPKART TEAM FOR SUCH A SPEEDY DELIVERY. GOT MY S3 WITHIN 27 HOURS OF TIME I PLACED THE ORDER.
      
      
      AND DO I EVEN NEED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BEHEMOTH OF A SMARTPHONE !! I JUST LOVE IT :)"
Galaxy S3,4,"1.I HAD ORDERED SAMSUNG S3ON EMI AND 15% MONEY BACK SCHEME, THROUGH ICICI CREDIT CARD.
      
      2. WAS THRILLED TO RECEIVE WITHIN 3 DAYS.
      
      3. EXCELLENT DEVICE AND IS REALLY VALUE FOR MONEY AFTER MONEY BACK AND EMI.
      
      4. I WAS REALLY SHOCKED TO SEE MY CREDIT CARD BILL, WHEN I FOUND THAT FULL MONEY HAS BEEN CHARGED IN THE CREDIT CARD BILL.
      
      5. THERE IS NO MENTION OF MONEY BACK IN THE BILL.
      
      6. WILL ADVISE ALL BUYERS TO CHECK THEIR CREDIT CARD BILL AND GET IT RECTIFIED AFTER COMPLAINING TO FLIPKART CUSTOMER SERVICE.
      
      7. MINE IS STILL TO BE RECTIFIED BY THEM.
      
      8. FLIPKART HAS NO SYSTEM OF INFORMING THE CUSTOMER ON THEIR OWN, AFTER RECTIFICATION, FOR WHICH I HAVE TO KEEP ON CONTACTING THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS REALLY ANNOYING.
      
      EDIT: THE AMOUNT HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO EMI ON 2ND MAY'13. 15% MONEYBACK IS STILL AWAITED."
Galaxy S3,4,A WONDERFUL PRODUCT FROM SAMSUNG IT IS JUST TOO GOOD. VERY VERY USER FRIENDLY WITH IMMENSE FEATURES IT DOUBLES UP AS A BUSINESS PHONE AND AN ENTERTAINMENT HUB. THE CAPACITATIVE SCREEN IS MARVELLOUS AND THE COLOURS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD! THE 8 MP CAMERA RESOLUTION IS VERY GOOD.
Galaxy S3,4,"AWESOME PHONE DELIVERED WITHIN 2 DAYS BY FLIPKART ..THANKS ONCE AGAIN. GOOD QUALITY , SPEEDY PROCESSOR, OUT OF THE BOX JELLY BEAN 4.1.2 UPDATE, NICE CAMERA.
      
      AFTER USING SUCH A HIGH END PHONE NOW I USE MY LAPTOP VERY LESS BECAUSE NOW ALL MY DAILY WORK IS DONE ON MY S3.
      
      AS FAR CONS ARE CONCERNED IN MY VIEW THE PHYSICAL POWER BUTTON IS SOMEWHAT LOOSE BUT ITS OK NOT A BIG ISSUE.
      
      AS THE PRICE IS LOW NOW FOR SUCH A NICE FLAGSHIP PHONE FROM SAMSUNG , ITS GOOD TIME TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Galaxy S3,4,"AWESOME PHONE. I GOT A BRICKRED COLOR AT 1.5K EXTRA DISCOUNT FROM FLIPKART. THEY DELIVERED IT AS PROMISED ON TIME WITH A BT DONGLE FREE..
      
      THE PHONE IS AS EXPECTED AWESOME. CHECK ENGADGET DOT COM FOR REVIEWS ON S3.
      
      CANT WAIT FOR S4!!!!"
Galaxy S3,4,"BATTERY- IN SPITE OF 2100MAH BATTERY IT ONLY WORKS FOR 7-8 HRS IN IDLE MODE AND 2-3 HRS WHILE WATCHING VIDEO OR APPS BROWSING.

      SO ITS THE BEST BET.GO FOR BEST QUALITY CAMERA,SOUND,PROCESSOR,TOUCH &AMP; SLEEK FEEL IN SAMSUNG GALAXY S3"
Galaxy S3,4,"BOUGHT A PEBBLE BLUE S3 FROM A LOCAL RETAILER AT 28K (WITH BILL :) )
      
      LOOKS:
      
      NOT MUCH CHOICE IN THE COLOUR DEPARTMENT COZ THERE IS VIDHWA WHITE OR GAY GARNET RED....
      
      ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO PREMIUM UNIBODY LIKE HTC OR DELUXE LOOK LIKE SONY XPERIA,LOOKS ARE ACCEPTABLE....
      
      
      PERFORMANCE:
      
      SLICK.COMES WITH ANDROID 4.1 OUT OF BOX.GORGEOUS AMOLED SCREEN.REALLY GREAT EXCEPT FOR SAMSUNG BLOATWARE LIKE CHATON,SAMSUNG APPS ETC. WHICH EAT DATA ON PRETEXT OF UPDATING...HAVEN'T FACED A SINGLE LAG THOUGH.WILL CONSIDER ROOTING IT AFTER WARRANTY ENDS.NO SWYPE KEYBOARD.WALLPAPERS CAN ONLY BE SET AT A PARTICULAR HEIGHT AND WIDTH OF IMAGE..SMART FEATURES LIKE DIRECT CALL.GREAT PERFORMANCE
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      GOOD.IS SATISFACTORY.
      
      
      BATTERY LIFE:
      
      DEPENDS ON USAGE.LESS THAN SATISFACTORY FOR HEAVY BROWSING OR GAMING.AMOLED TOO HOGS A LOT OF BATTERY ESPECIALLY AT FULL BRIGHTNESS.
      
      BUT IF YOU USE IT FRUGALLY BY USING MINIMAL OR AUTO BRIGHTNESS AND TURN OFF THINGS LIKE MOBILE DATA,WI-FI,BLUETOOTH ETC. UNLESS REQUIRED AND STOP APPS LIKE S-VOICE IN BACKGROUND AND TURN ON POWER SAVING MODE IT CAN EASILY GET THROUGH AN ENTIRE DAY (TRIED THIS AND ONLY 2% WAS DISCHARGED IN 2 HRS)
      
      PHONE GETS HEATED UP IF YOU INDULGE IN HARDCORE GAMING AND BATTERY DISCHARGES QUICKLY.IN THAT CASE KEEP A POWERPACK OR SPARE BATTERY HANDY
      
      
      NOTES:
      
      YOU HAVE TO BUY A PROTECTIVE COVER OR CASE. IF YOU DROP IT THAT IS THE END.SEE THE DROP TEST VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE FOR YOURSELF.I BOUGHT A MUSUBO RUBBER BAND CASE.SOME RECOMMEND FLIP CASES BUT I DNT THINK THEY PROVIDE DECENT PROTECTION.
      
      SCRATCH GUARD MANDATORY..
      
      BUY A POWERPACK OR BATTERY IN CASE YOU ARE A HEAVY USER.
      
      16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY SHOULD BE ENOUGH AND YOU CAN EXPAND IT WENEVER U WANT
      
      ALSO KEEP A MICRO SIM HANDY BEFORE YOU BUY IT
      
      
      CONCLUSION:
      
      IF YOUR BUDGET IS AROUND 40K-50K LOOK FOR SONY XPERIA Z OR IPHONE OR HTC BUTTERFLY.BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DECENT PHONE AT AROUND 28K,LOOK NO FURTHER......."
Galaxy S3,4,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR 28.8K FROM FLIPKART ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO. GOT THE 16GB MICROSD AND SAMSUNG BLUETOOTH HEADSET FREE WITH THIS OFFER WHEN I BOUGHT. FLIPKART SERVICE WAS GOOD SINCE THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED WITHIN THE DESIGNATED TIME.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS GOOD. I HAVE USED THIS FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS NOW, AND I REALLY LIKE THIS DEVICE. THE SCREEN CLARITY (TRUE HD) IS BRILLIANT IN MY OPINION. THE SOUND CLARITY IS GOOD. THE LITTLE FEATURES PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG ARE NICE AND REALLY HANDY. AN UPDATE TO ANDROID 4.1.2 IS READILY AVAILABLE, AND ONCE UPDATED IT GIVES A NEWER LOOKING GALLERY AND ALSO THE ""MULTI-WINDOW"" OPTION LIKE NOTE 2 WHERE YOU CAN SPLIT YOUR SCREEN INTO TWO APPLICATIONS AT A GIVEN TIME. ONLY PROBLEM IS NOT ALL APPS SUPPORT THIS FEATURE AS OF NOW (LIKE WHATSAPP DOESN'T).
      
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD, BOTH FRONT AND REAR. VIDEOS CAPTURED ARE EXCELLENT AND IN HD THEY ARE JUST BRILLIANT. BATTERY IS DECENT, GIVES ME ABOUT 10-11 HOURS OF BATTERY TIME WHICH I THINK IS DECENT FOR A SMARTPHONE THIS SIZE.
      
      
      ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WITH THIS PHONE IS THAT IT'S REALLY SLIPPERY. IT NEEDS A BIT OF CARE TO HANDLE. BUT BECAUSE OF ITS SLIM SIZE AND LIGHT-WEIGHT, THIS IS A BREEZE TO FIT IN YOUR POCKETS UNLIKE THE NOTE 2 WHICH IS VERY BULKY (UNDERSTANDABLY SO GIVEN ITS 5.5"" SCREEN!).
      
      
      OVERALL, DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!"
Galaxy S3,4,"DONT WANT ANY CONTROVERSY BUT SAMSUNG S3 IS EQUALLY GOOD AS IPHONE 5.....I HAVE USED IPHONE 4S AND CURRENTLY USING S3......I LIKE BOTH THE DEVICES.....
      
      IPHONE GOT THE LOOKS WHEREAS S3 GOT THE FEATURES......"
Galaxy S3,4,"EARLIER TO THIS PHONE I WAS USING IPHONE 3GS AND THIS PHONE IS A GREAT UPGRADE IN TERMS OF DISPLAY (SIZE AND RESOLUTION), THE OS AND IN GENERAL. PEOPLE STILL KEEP SAYING THAT THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF IPHONE LIES IN THE APPS, BUT I DON'T THINK THATS TRUE ANYMORE. ITUNES STILL HAS LARGER COLLECTION BUT THE NUMBER OF FREE APPS ARE GETTING LESSER DAY BY DAY. WHEREAS IN GOOGLE PLAY STORE THERE ARE STILL LARGE COLLECTION OF FREE APPS. THIS MATTERS A LOT TO ME.
      
      HOWEVER THE HARDWARE/SOFTWARE OPTIMIZATION IS STILL NOT UP-TO THE MARK COMPARED WITH IPHONE. EG: PLAYING CONTRACT KILLER IN IPHONE 3GS IS STILL MUCH MORE FLUID AND SEAMLESS COMPARED TO GALAXY S3. AND PULLING UP PHONE CONTACT LIST TAKES WAY TOO LONG. ALSO THE VOLUME ON THE MUSIC PLAYER THAT COMES BUNDLED WITH THE PHONE IS TOO LOW. IT'S NOT EVEN COMPARABLE TO GALAXY ACE.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL A GREAT PHONE, WITH FEW HICCUPS. BUT I STILL LOVE IT."
Galaxy S3,4,"FEATURES OF BOTH THE PHONES ARE ALMOST SIMILAR. NOTHING MUCH TO DIFFERENTIATE, COS MOST USERS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO EXPLOIT THE PROCESSING CAPABILITIES OR OTHER HIGH END FEATURES.
      
      
      ONLY THING THAT MAKES GALAXY S3 BETTER IS BATTERY, COS THAT'S WHAT MATTERS TO EVERY PHONE USER. IT'S REMOVABLE UNLIKE HTC. HAS MORE LIFE UNLIKE HTC.
      
      
      YOUR PHONE IS OF NO USE WITHOUT BATTERY BACKUP. THINK ABOUT IT.
      
      
      SECONDLY, HTC'S AFTER SALES SERVICE IS NO WAY NEAR SAMSUNG. THINK ABOUT THAT AS WELL AND THEN CHOOSE A PHONE :)
      
      
      HAVING PHONE LIKE THESE TWO FOR MOST USERS WILL BE SIMILAR TO HAVING A FERRARI ON CROWDED INDIAN ROADS. YOU WILL OWN THE BEST CAR, BUT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO EXPLOIT ITS SPEED IN THOSE CROWDED CONDITIONS. SO DON'T COMPARE 1.4 WITH 1.5 PROCESSOR COS MOST USERS WILL NEVER USE THAT MUCH PROCESSING POWER. FOR THAT MATTER CAMERA AS WELL.
      
      
      I WOULD PREFER SHELLING OUT 2-3 THOUSAND EXTRA FIRST UP AND BUY AN S3 WITH REMOVABLE BATTERY AND TOO WITH LONGER LIFE INSTEAD OF HTC. BATTERY IS LIFE FOR PHONE'S"
Galaxy S3,4,"FIRST OF ALL ACKNOWLEDGMENT. KUDOS TO FLIPKART DELIVERY WHICH DELIVERED PRODUCT IN MY HAND ON JUNE 7, THE DAY IT WAS LAUNCHED IN MANY RETAIL CHAINS SUCH AS CROMA AND THAT TOO, 100 BUCKS COSTLIER. NOW, I DO NOT THINK THERE IS ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFIT WHICH RETAILERS WERE GIVING AT THE SAME PRICE AS FLIPKART SO WHY NOT GET IT HOME DELIVERED AND CHOOSE FROM A VARIETY OF PAYMENT OPTIONS? :-)
      
      NEXT, TWO THUMBS UP TO SOUMYADEEP AND AKSHAY PUJARI TO WRITE SO ELABORATELY ABOUT SGS3, ESPECIALLY THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF ITS EDGE OVER OTHERS. IT WOULD STAND USEFUL TO THOSE WHO STILL WONDER 1.4 IS MORE THAN 1.5!
      
      NOW COMING TO A FEW POINTS ABOUT THE PHONE BY ME, I AM NOT A AVID CELLPHONE CAMERA USER SINCE I USE D-SLR FOR PHOTO SHOOT BUT THE SGS3 CAMERA HAS SOME PRESET COLOR SETTINGS SUCH AS HUE AND TEMPERATURE. IF SHOT IN TUNGSTEN LIGHTING WITH FLASH INDOORS, IT GIVES BLUE TINGE. NO SUCH THING IF ALREADY FLUORESCENT LIGHTING EXISTS BUT THEN THE EFFECTIVE NATURE OF FLASH IS LIMITING. STILL, OKAY FOR A 8MP CAMERA.
      
      THE GOOD POINT ABOUT SLEEK BODY WHETHER ONE CONSIDERS PLASTIC TYPE 'FEELING' ON THE BACK OR NOT IS THAT WITH 4.8"" SCREEN SIZE, ANY THICKER BODY WOULD HAVE MADE IT BULKY AND COULD HAVE MADE IT STAND OUT LIKE NOKIA. I AM CONSIDERING STAND-OUT WITH DIFFERENT SENSE IF YOU COULD GET THE WIND OF IT. ;-) NOT ONLY IT IS DAMN SLEEK, IT APPEARS THE SAME TOO, WHEN IN HAND. BEST SIZED TO WATCH HD VIDEOS AND GOOD SUPPORTING VIDEO TYPES GIVES PLEASANT EXPERIENCE. A FEW VIDEO TYPES DEMANDING SEPARATE CODECS DO NOT RUN ON THE PRE-INSTALLED VIDEO PLAYER. BUT SO WHAT, I INSTALLED VPLAYER AND IT RUNS ME EVERYTHING.
      
      SO, YOU MAY ASK THAT WHAT THIS PHONE IS OFFERING IF ONE NEEDS TO GET APPS FOR RUNNING DIFFERENT TASKS. MY ANSWER TO THIS LIES IN FLEXIBILITY WITH SPACE AND THAT SHALL ANSWER FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE COMPARING 16 WITH 32 OF ONE-X. WITH 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY, YOU'LL NEVER RUN OUT OF SPACE AS FAR AS INSTALLING APPS IS CONCERNED ESPECIALLY IF YOU INSTALL WHAT YOU USE THE MOST. BUT, WITH ADDITIONAL MICROSD CARD NOT ONLY ONE CAN SAVE THE SET-UP IN IT THUS FREEING EVEN INTERNAL MEMORY, IT IT GIVES A LOT OF FREEDOM WHEN DECIDING YOUR MEMORY REQUIREMENTS, ITS ALLOCATION AND USAGE. I PERSONALLY, LIKE THAT CONTROLLING CAPABILITY DELIVERED THROUGH SGS3.
      
      SAME FLEXIBILITY GOES FOR BATTERY. NOW, CHARGING CONDITIONS VARY IN INDIA IF YOU TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT DESTINATIONS ESPECIALLY INTO RURAL INDIA. CHANCES ARE BRIGHT THAT DUE TO DIFFERENT CURRENT-VOLTAGE PROVISIONS, THE BATTERY MAY NOT LAST THAT LONG AS PROMISED BY THE MANUFACTURER. I AM TALKING ABOUT THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE IN AGE RATHER THAN DAILY CHARGE-DISCHARGE HERE, BUT YES, IF BATTERY GOES POOR THEN I HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO BUY A NEW ONE AND REPLACE IT MYSELF!
      
      I AM NOT SAILING THROUGH DEEP WATERS OF TECHNOLOGY AS IT IS ALREADY DONE BRILLIANTLY BY SOUMYADEEP AND AKSHAY PUJARA BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHERE COMES THE ISSUE WITH PRICE?
      
      WHEN HAS IT HAPPENED THAT PRICES OF ONION AND GARLIC HAVE TURNED INDIANS INTO THOSE SECT FOLLOWERS WHO SHUN ONIONS AND GARLIC IN THEIR FOOD? WHEN HAS THE PRICE OF PETROL LED TO SHIFT TOWARDS USING BICYCLE IN INDIA? AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TOP OF THE LINE COMMUNICATION AND MULTIMEDIA DEVICE. ASK AN APPLE SUBSCRIBER ABOUT THE PRICE IF ONE STILL PURCHASES 4S IN INDIA. I THOUGHT WITH ITS CURRENT FEATURES, THE PRICE WOULD BE AROUND 40K AND IT ENDED THAT WAY. IF ONE WANTS TO SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS, IT AIN'T THAT SAMSUNG HAS NOT PROVIDED WITH OPTIONS AND THEREFORE, US COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRICE IS NOT JUSTIFIED. WITH ONE TIME PAYMENT, WE ARE IGNORING THE FACT, THAT THE POWER OF USING ANDROID ENABLES US TO SAVE A LOT DURING OUR USAGE FOR DIFFERENT FILE TYPES ASSOCIATED WITH WORK REQUIREMENTS. SO, I CONSIDER THE PRICE OF SGS3 AS A CONSOLIDATED PRICE FOR HIGH-TECH SOLUTION AND IF SAMSUNG + GOOGLE ARE CHARGING ONE TIME HIGHER PRICE THAN ONE-X THEN IT IS MORE LIKE THEY ARE DECLARING THE WORTH OF THIS PRODUCT OVER ONE-X THROUGH ALL ANGLES. THE BEST IS ALWAYS COSTLIER THAN THE BETTER!
      
      ITS A GOOD PHONE TO LAST LONG. I FOUND 2 CHALLENGES SO FAR AND SO HAVE RATED 4 OUT OF 5. ONE IS THAT THE MESSAGE ICON SHOWS INCORRECT UNREAD MESSAGE ALERT SUCH AS 1 OR 2 AND IT GOES AWAY ONLY WITH RESTART. ITS IRRITATING BUT NOW I AM SETTLING WITH IT. SECOND IS ABOUT THE 'FACE DETECTION' S-APP WHICH IS ILLUMINATION DEPENDENT AS DESCRIBED BY MY FELLOW REVIEWERS. S-VOICE HAVING GLITCHES SIMILAR TO SIRI WAS EXPECTED AND THUS, IT HAS MET MY EXPECTATIONS. SO, I WOULD RATHER NOT COMPLAINT BUT NOT USE IT TO AVOID THE FRUSTRATION ON SPEAKING THE NAMES! :-P
      
      THANK YOU FOR PATIENT READING."
Galaxy S3,4,"FIRST OF ALL THANKS TO THE FLIPKART TEAM FOR THEIR SERVICE WHICH IS USUALLY THE BEST. I GOT IT IN GOOD SHAPED WRAPPED WELL. THANKS GUYZ YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB!
      
      
      THIS ONE WILL BE A LONG ONE AND MOST PROBABLY ALL OF YOU HAVE READ MOST OF THE REVIEWS BUT EVEN THEN I'LL SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOU.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS ONE POWERFUL MACHINE AS WE ALL KNOW IT HAS QUAD-CORE 1.4 GHZ PRCR. HAS THE SMOOTHNESS OF APPLICATIONS WHICH I WAS LOOKING FOR, AS WE ALL KNOW THAT SAMSUNG HAS THE RECORD OF MAKING MULTI TASKING EASIER THAN ANYTHING, IT STANDS UPTO IT'S REPUTATION AND DELIVERS IT QUITE WELL. THE 1 GB RAM IS QUITE GOOD AND MAKES SURFING, TEXTING AND PLAYING MUSIC AT THE SAME TIME A PIECE OF CAKE. REST YOU WILL KNOW FOR YOURSELF WHEN YOU USE IT.
      
      
      AHEAD WE MOVE TO TINY DETAILS-
      
      THE 4.8-INCH SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY MEANS WATCHING MOVIES WILL BE A BREEZE AND THE ADDITIONAL GORILLA GLASS OFFERS GREATER DURABILITY AND PROTECTION.
      
      8-MEGAPIXEL CAMERA ALONG WITH 1080P HD VIDEO RECORDING AND SKPYE VIDEO CALLS A GOOD FEATURE TO USE TO. ALLTHOUGH DIM LIT PICS WILL BE A BIT UNCLEAR, BUT WELL THAT'S JUST IN FEW CCASES.
      
      ONCE YOU'VE TAKEN LOTS OF PHOTOS AND VIDEOS, THERE IS AN IMAGE AND VIDEO EDITOR ALONG WITH 16GB INTERNAL MEMORY (WHICH CAN BE BOOSTED TO 64GB VIA THE MICROSD CARD SLOT) TO STORE THEM ALL.
      
      OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE S3 IS THE VIDEO POP FEATURE WHICH GIVES YOU PICTURE-IN-PICTURE SO YOU CAN WATCH YOUR FILMS OR VIDEOS ON THE GO WHILE STILL BROWSING - PERFECT FOR MULTI-TASKING..!!
      
      
      NOW FOR THE CONS AS WELL ALL KNOW IT COMES WITH THE PRICE.
      
      - TERRIBLE BATTERY LIFE. (SORRY PEOPLE BUT THAT'S TRUE, SO ALL YOU TEMPLE RUN USERS/TEXTING AND MUSIC LOVERS, IT WILL BOTHER YOU SOMETIMES TO CHARGE THE PHONE AFTER EVERY 5-6 HOURS OF HEAVY USAGE)
      
      - 4-5 HOURS (IF YOU'RE LUCKY) OF BATTEY LIFE WITH MINIMAL USE.
      
      - NO SD CARD INCLUDED
      
      - S VOICE NEEDS UPDATING
      
      - IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WAY BETTER IF IT CAME WITH A 2GB RAM, BUT THAT'S ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO PLAY REAL HARDCORE GAMES LIKE N.O.V.A.
      
      
      MAYBE THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH WHAT RUNS IN THE BACKGROUND OR HOW IT SLEEPS - I DON'T KNOW - BUT THE BATTERY DRAINING ISSUES WITH THIS PHONE MAKE IT EXTREMELY IMPRACTICAL - AS YOU NEED TO CARRY YOUR CHARGING CABLE WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES AND HOVER NEAR POWER OUTLETS SO YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR ABILITY TO USE THE DEVICE IN 4 HOURS !!!
      
      I JUST GOT RID OF MY WINDOWS PHONE SO THIS ONE IS A GOOD CHANGE ALTHOUGH THE WINDOWS WINS OVER ANDROID ANY DAY IN THE FIELD OF BATTERY PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      OVERALL I WAS PLEASED WITH THE SPEED OF THE PHONE, APPS LOAD UP INSTANTANEOUSLY AND THE PROCESSING LOAD IS INSIGNIFICANT WITH THE SPEED OF THE S4 CHIPSET AND THE 1GB OF RAM. THE OVERALL DESIGN OF THE PHONE'S EXTERIOR IS BEAUTIFUL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BACK COVER. BESIDES MAINTAINING A THIN SLEEKER PROFILE THAN ITS PREDECESSORS THE BACKING FEELS CHEAP AND PLASTICKY. LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING WHEN YOUU FIRST SEE THE BACK OF THE PHONE. BTW, THE OVERALL PHONE IS GLOSSY AND IS A HUGE FINGERPRINT MAGNET. IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LESS NOTICEABLE ON THE WHITE S3. THERE IS A BIT OF STURDINESS WITH THE PHONE AND IT IS PRETTY LIGHTWEIGHT BUT NOT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE THE PHONE WILL BREAK IN YOUR HANDS. GRIPPING THE PHONE IS ALRIGHT AND THE SCREEN AS USUAL IS SMOOTH AND VERY TOUCH FRIENDLY. THE SCREEN IS BEAUTIFUL AND LOOKS HAS THE GLOSSY FINISH!
      
      SAMSUNG HAS DONE A GOOD JOB WITH ITS UTILIZATION OF AMOLED DISPLAYS.
      
      
      SO MY RATING FOR THIS PHONE WOULD BE 4. (-1 FOR BATTERY)"
Galaxy S3,4,"FIRSTLY KARAN SINGH'S REVIEW ISNT CORRECT IN SOME ASPECTS ...FIRSTLY, THE GRAPHICS HAVE BEEN IMPROVED A LOT....ALTHOUGH IT IS CALLED MALI 400MP , ITS SUPER POWERFUL...IT BEATS THE GRAPHICS OF ALL PHONES - EVEN THE IPHONE 4S AND THE ONLY OTHER SMARTPHONE /TABLET THAT CAN BEAT IT IN THE GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT IS THE IPAD 3...SECONDLY THE PROCESSOR ON HTC ONE X IS 1.5 GHZ AND THAT ON S3 IS 1.4 BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN HTC ONE X IS FASTER...THE PROCESSOR ON ONE X IS BASED ON A OLD 45NM MANUFACTURING PROCESS WHEREAS THE S3 IS BASED ON 32 NM ...WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE S3 WILL EASILY OUTPERFORM THE ONE X AND CONSUME LESS POWER  AND BE SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER THAN ONE X WHICH CONSUMES MORE BATTERY, IS LESS POWERFUL, AND HEATS UP FASTER ... THIRDLY, S VOICE RESPONSE IS QUITE FAST AND IT CAN BE LAUNCHED USING VOICE , NOT BY LONG PRESSING ON A BUTTON AS KARAN SAID...AND ITS NOT JUST USED TO OPEN APPS...IT CAN BE USED TO BROWSE THE WEB , SEND TEXT MSGS, AND ALSO THE FEATURES LIKE SMART DIALING, AND SMART STAY ARE VERY USEFUL...AND REGARDING THE DISPLAY, ITS GOT THE BEST SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY( CHECK REVIEW IN GSMARENA.COM )...AND LASTLY, ALTHOUGH BOTH PHONES ARE SAID TO HAVE 1 GB RAM , THE OS USES MOST OF THE RAM ...SO THE ACTUAL USER AVAILABLE RAM IS DIFFERENT FOR THE PHONES...HTC SENSE UI USES MORE RAM SO ABOUT 450 MB IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER WHEREAS THE S3 USES A LIGHT VERSION OF TOUCHWIZ AND IT HAS ABOUT 550 MB RAM AVAILABLE FOR THE USER ( I CHECKED IT MYSELF ) ...SO OVERALL S3 WINS...UNLESS U WANT GOOD BUILD QUALITY, GO FOR S3...THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN PRICE IS WORTH IT"
Galaxy S3,4,"GOT MY S3 ON 25TH JUNE, FLIPKART-AWESOME SERVICE, THE 2ND BUSINESS NOON, THE PHONE WAS IN MY HANDS. TOOK IT WITH 3 MONTHS EMI SCHEME ON MY CREDIT CARD, EXTRA 100RS FOR IT, TOTAL PAID 39K FOR THIS MACHINE. FLIPKART DID A GREAT JOB OVER ALL.
      
      
      ABOUT THE MOBILE:
      
      FIRST LOOK, IMPRESSIVE, AWESOME FEEL, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE WITH THIS BEAUTY IN HAND, SO FEELS GREAT. THE WATER THEME SCREEN SAVER IS AN EYE CATCHER, DEFINITELY.
      
      SCREEN SENSITIVITY IS AWESOME. GOT THE FLIP COVER FOR 1500, SCREEN GUARD FOR 500....A LOT OF MONEY SPENT....
      
      
      1.4 QUAD PRCESSOR, 1 GB RAM - FEELS GOOD...DEFINITELY FASTER THAN OTHER PHONES/PDA'S WHATEVER YOU CALL IT.
      
      YOU NEED A MICRO SIM FOR THIS PHONE, SO HAD TO RUSH TO THE VODAPHONE STORE AND GET ONE, GOT IT IMMEDIATELY AND THE PHONE WAS UP AND RUNNING. 2 MONTHS FREE 3G WAS ACTIVATELY REALY FAST, VODAFONE OFFER. ANDROID ICS IS GOOD...
      
      
      DONT REALLY NEED MY LAPTOP ANYMORE, IT VIRTUALLY HAS EVERYTHING, HAD A 8GB MEM, PLAN TO UPGRADE IT TO 64 GB SOON, OUT OF CASH RIGHT NOW...
      
      
      GREAT CAMERA, CLEAR GOOD PICTURES, HD VIDEO'S ARE GREAT.
      
      ALL IS WELL....NOW THE PROBLEMS: I HAVE EXPERIENCED A FEW:
      
      
      1. HEATING PROBLEM - ITS REAL, THE PHONE GETS HEATED UP REAL FAST, THANKS TO THE FLIP COVER THAT I HAVE THAT I FOLD AROUND ITS BACK SO I DONT FEEL IT MUCH, BUT OTHERWISE, IT BECOMES REAL HOT.
      
      
      2. 3 DAYS BACK, IT REFUSED TO GET CHARGED; I TRIED DIFFERENT SAMSUNG CHARGERS, NO GOOD, IT JUST REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE   CHARGER, AFTER A FEW HOURS, I TRIED THE USB CHARGING MODE THROUGH MY LAPTOP AND IT WORKED, LATER IT WAS NORMAL AND WAS CHARGING WITH AN ELECTRIC CHARGER. THAT WAS STRANGE BEHAVIOUR.
      
      
      3. LAST NIGHT, THE PHONE WAS 80% CHARGED, I SET AN ALARM AND SLEPT, BUT THE PHONE WAS DEAD IN THE MORNING, I DONT KNOW WHY, NOTHIN WAS ON, 3G, WIFI....EVERYTHING WAS DISABLED, I DONT KNOW WHY THE BATTERY DRAINED COMPLETELY.
      
      
      4. THIS PHONE DOES NOT SLEEP BEFORE YOU DO - THE ADVT SAYS THAT....DINT QUITE EXPERIENCE IT, IT DOES SLEEP! THAT FEATURE IS NOT WORKING QUITE WELL.
      
      
      5. TALK TO YOUR S3 - TELL HER THAT YOU NEED TO SLEEP A LITTLE WHILE MORE AND ALL THOSE INTERACTIVE FEATURES, DINT REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WORKS....HAVE TO EXPLORE...
      
      
      HOPE SAMSUNG GETS ALL THESE ISSUES FIXED....ONE YEAR WARRANTY, I'LL WAIT FOR 2-3 MONTHS, IF THEY HAVE A FIX AND DECIDE HOW TO FIX THE ISSUE'S OF THE SOLD PHONES LIKE MINE, GOOD, ELSE I'LL CLAIM MY WARRANTY!
      
      AFTER PAYING 40 FREAKING THOUSAND, I DONT WANT NO ISSUE WITH THIS MACHINE!
      
      
      THIS IS THE MOST DESCRIPTIVE I COULD GET, ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, SHOOT!"
Galaxy S3,4,"HELLO ANDROID FANS,
      
      
      HERE IS WHERE WE ARE HEADED AND HERE IS HOW THINGS WOULD GO WRONG IF WE DONT REALLY DEMAND THE ABSOLUTE BEST. I KNOW YOU MIGHT ASK IF IT IS ABOUT THIS MONSTER OF A SAMSUNG PHONE OR ANDROID IN GENERAL, I WOULD PITCH MORE TO SAY, ""BOTH"". EVER WONDERED WHAT DO YOU REALLY USE YOUR PHONE FOR. HERE IT IS, ""MEDIA CONSUMPTION?, CALLS, SMS, IM, GAMING, INTERNET BROWSING AND SOME MAPS ETC. HOW SATISFIED ARE WE WITH SAMSUNGS, HTCS, SONYS OR LGS OR MOTOS, I DOUBT IF WE HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT.
      
      
      BEFORE YOU TRIGGER ME WITH MORE STARES, LET ME PUT A QUESTION, ALL ANDROID PHONES HAVE A ""BACK"" BUTTON AND THE STUTTER WE FEEL WHEN WE JUST HAVE TO GO BACK TO A PREVIOUS STATE LEAVES THE PHONE CRYING FOR MORE RAM AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE MORE AND MORE RAM BEING CRAMMED INTO. FIRST IT WAS 512 MB, NOW 1GB IS COMMON AND EVEN THIS PHONE HAS 2GB IN JAPAN, NTT DOCOMO AND FOR CANADA VERSION.
      
      
      ABOUT THE SCREEN REAL ESTATE, YES IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND BIG AND REALLY AN ENTICIG PROPOSITION. THEN THE QUESTION COMES ABOUT IT BEING USED DAY IN AND OUT, WITH A DEMAND TO HAVE MORE PRODUCTIVITY OUT OF IT. IMAGINE HAVING TO CLEAN A HUGE SLAB OF GLASS AFTER A LONG CALL WITH HER, THE SWEATS, THE SMEARS OF FINGER PRINTS, HOW HAPPY THAT FEELS? I DOUBT IT. YES WHEN WE SEE A VIDEO AND PLAY A FPS GAME LIKE MODERN COMBAT IT FEELS A BOON. BUT WE DO INTEND TO DO IT ALL DAY? DO WE REALLY WANT A 4.8"" SCREEN? WHY WOULD WE NEED TWO HANDS TO USE IT? I AGREE, THE GUYS AT INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS KNOW THE FACT AND ARE LEAVING NO CORNER TO CUT THE SLIGHTEST OF THE EXTRA SPACE AND GIVING IT AN OPTIMIZED FOOT PRINT, STILL THE DILEMMA OF AN OPTIMIZED SIZE OF A SCREEN WILL RING TRUE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME!! THINK WHY THE SCREEN AND KEY DIMENSION OF AN IPHONE HAS NOT GONE FOR A CHANGE FOR OVER 5 YEARS, YEAH, EXACTLY...I STILL FEEL A SCREEN SIZE OF 4~4.2 INCH IS PRETTY GREAT AND MANAGEABLE DAY IN AND OUT.
      
      
      NOW THE SOFTWARE PART, HERE IS SAMSUNG GOES ARROGANT!! WHY DO THEY HAVE TO TAKE A BEAUTY LIKE ICS AND TURN INTO AN UGLY TOUCHWIZ? I CAN NEVER GET THAT. THE ICONS LOOK HILARIOUS AND BAD, THE NOTIFICATION AREA IS HEAVILY CROWDED. THE MUSIC HUB, THE GAME HUB, THE SOCIAL HUB ARE OVERKILL. S-VOICE IS A JOKE, EVEN A WORSE JOKE THAT SIRI. CONSIDERING SAMSUNG HAD FULL ACCESS TO GOOGLE SERVICES, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL IF WELL IMPLEMENTED. SEEMS A FEATURE TO FEATURE MATCH GAME SAMSUNG WANTS TO PLAY.
      
      
      LAST AND NOT THE LEAST, ABOUT THE HARDWARE DESIGN. IT IS UGLY, PERIOD.
      
      
      OKAY, NOW SOME GOOD POINTS-
      
      
      1) BEAUTIFUL SCREEN, INFINITE CONTRAST, NATURAL COLORS AND A REFINE PENTILE ARRANGEMENT
      
      2) HOLD TO CALL, SWIPE TO CALL/SMS, SMART STAY ARE GREAT STUFF. APPLE SHOULD FEEL ENTICED TO COPY THEM :)
      
      3) S BEAM, GREAT WAY TO TRANSFER HEAVY FILES. SAMSUNG SHOULD ADVERTIZE THIS EVEN MORE TO MAKE PEOPLE KNOW IT IS GREAT. IT SHOULD ALSO HAPPEN WITH LOWER SPEC?ED DEVICES AS WE GO FURTHER
      
      
      NOW THE REAL DEAL, SHOULD YOU BUY IT. GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT A FLAGSHIP DEVICE AND YOU DON?T LIKE AN IPHONE. IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN ONE X. ONE X HAS A DISAPPOINTING BATTERY LIFE AND SOME STRANGE YELLOW TINT ON SCREEN ISSUE!!
      
      
      JAGANNATH."
Galaxy S3,4,"HI GUYS, THIS IS ONE MOBILE YOU SHOULD BUY IN YOUR LIFETIME.
      
      GREAT HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
      
      LIGHTENING SPEED
      
      GREAT REAR &AMP; FRONT CAM
      
      SLEEK DESIGN AND HD SCREEN ARE ADDED ADVANTAGES
      
      
      YOU CAN ASK NO MORE
      
      
      BUT 1GB RAM IS BIT LESS FOR SUCH ADVANCED MOBILE, SHOULD HAVE RELEASED WITH 2GB RAM WORLD WIDE (AVAILABLE IN ONLY SOME COUNTRIES) - SOME APPS SLOWS DOWN YOUR MOBILE A BIT DUE TO HIGH MEMORY.
      
      
      AFTER USING THE MOBILE FOR 4 MONTHS I'M FULLY SATISFIED WITH THIS SAMSUNG SIII
      
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND TO BUY THIS ONE, RATHER GOING FOR S4 OR ANY OTHER BB OR SONY MOBILES."
Galaxy S3,4,I AM NOT MUCH IMPRESSED WITH S3 BUILD QUALITY BUT MAINLY I CAME HERE TO TELL ABOUT FLIPKART SERVICE . . . REALLY AWESOME ! GOT IT IN HAND WITHIN 26 HOURS OF ORDERING IT  !!! VERY VERY FAST DELIVERY AND REALLY GOOD PACKAGING . . . THANKS TO FLIPKART !
Galaxy S3,4,"I AM NOT SAMSUNG FAN BUT GIVEN THE MARKET PLACE YOU HAVE ONLY FEW OPTION LEFT FOR CONSIDERATION IN THIS PRICE TAG. AROUND 3 YEARS BACK 25-30K RANGE USED TO BE VERY PREMIUM AND NOW IT IS MID RANGE. :)
      
      
      I HAD TWO SHORTLISTED DEVICES S3 AND GOOGLE NEXUS 4. GIVEN THE RELEASE DATE, SAMSUNG SUPPORT IN INDIA AND PRODUCT SERVICE AVAILABLE, OBVIOUS CHOICE IS SAMSUNG.

Galaxy S3,4,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE 4 MONTHS AGO. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
      
      SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY IS JUST AWESOME.
      
      DAY LIGHT CAMERA IMAGE IS VERY GOOD.LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE IS NOT AS GOOD AS DAY LIGHT.
      
      FOR ME BATTERY LASTS FOR 3 DAYS(I ONLY USE IT FOR CALLING,WHATSAPP AND SOMETIMES LITTLE FACEBOOK).
      
      LOUDSPEAKER PERFORMANCE IS AVERAGE.
      
      NOW WAITING FOR JELLYBEAN 4.2 UPDATE."
Galaxy S3,4,"I HAD EXTREMELY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FROM THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 AND I MUST SAY THE PHONE TOTALLY LIVED UPTO THE EXPECTATIONS.  IT DEFINITELY BEATS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.  IT IS LOADED WITH VERY USEFUL NEW FEATURES AND I LOVE THE BIGGER SCREEN.  THOUGH, SOMETIMES I MISS MY NEXUS S FOR THE MORE POCKET FRIENDLY SIZE."
Galaxy S3,4,"I HAD LIKED GALAXY S2, AND WAS LOOKING FOR A REPLACEMENT . I BORROWED EACH ONE FOR THREE DAYS FROM MY RETAILER, AND FINALLY CHOSE HTC ONE X. MY IMPRESSIONS WERE:
      
      
      A. DISPLAY- BOTH ARE IMPRESSIVE. THOUGH, I LIKED SAMSUNG SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY FOR VIVID COLORS, BUT IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT HTC ONE WAS BETTER.
      
      
      B. BATTERY: BOTH WERE OK FOR MY KIND OF USAGE, MOSTLY IN AN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT. THOUGH HTC GETS A LITTLE HOT, AND BATTERY IS ALSO NOT USER REPLACEABLE.
      
      
      C. STORAGE: SAMSUNG IS 16GB, BUT YOU CAN ADD ANOTHER 64GB. HTC HAS NO SUCH OPTION, THOUGH HAS 32GB. BOTH COME WITH 1GB RAM. FOR ME 32GB ON-BOARD SPACE WAS ENOUGH, AS I WAS QUITE HAPPY WITH 16GB ON MY S2.
      
      
      D. CAMERA: BOTH WERE AWESOME FOR MY LIMITED NEEDS.
      
      
      E. PRICE: HTC ONE X WAS 4K LESS, THOUGH IT HAS 16GB MORE SPACE.
      
      
      F. BRAND: I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH SAMSUNG'S TREATMENT OF ITS INDIAN CUSTOMERS. INDIA IS ALWAYS LAST TO RECEIVE ANY UPDATES. IN FACT, INDIA WAS ONE OF OF THE LAST COUNTRIES TO RECEIVE ICS UPDATE ON S2, ALMOST TWO AND HALF MONTHS AFTER THEY RELEASED IN KOREA AND SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
      
      
      BOTH ARE IMPRESSIVE PHONES.  FOR ME S3 NEGATIVES WERE PRICE AND SAMSUNG'S UPDATE POLICY FOR INDIA (5/7), WHILE FOR ONEX MINUS IS NON-USER-REPLACEABLE BATTERY (6/7)."
Galaxy S3,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE LAST MONTH...
      
      PERFORMANCE WISE IT IS THE BEST COZ BENCHMARK TEST RESULTS ARE WAY HIGH THAN HTC ONE X
      
      
      OTHER IMPORTANT THING IS..
      
      
      IT SUPPORTS EXPANDABLE MEMORY UPTO 64GB VS NO CARD SLOT IN HTC ONE X(ONLY 16 OR 32GB INBUILT)
      
      
      ONLY ONE DISAPPOINTING THING IS THE BUILD QUALITY (ESPECIALLY THE PLASTIC MATERIAL USED)IS AVERAGE
      
      
      BUT THERE ARE MANY BRANDS IN THE MARKETS WHICH PROVIDE SHOCKPROOF HARD BACK CASES
      
      FOR S3.... SO GO WITH IT... THE PHONE IS ALMOST UNBEATABLE..."
Galaxy S3,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE ONE MONTH AND IT HAS IMPRESSED ME IN EVERY ASPECT. RAW POWER, SMOOTH UI AND THE EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE ANDROID 4.0.4 MAKE THIS PHONE A COMPLETE PACKAGE. PLAY GAMES AND WATCH VIDEOS ON ITS HUGE SCREEN. IT RUNS EVEN HIGH END GAMES WITH ELAN.
      
      
      ITS ONLY COMPETITION IS THE NOKIA LUMIA 920, HTC ONE X AND THE NEW LG OPTIMUS G. IT GOES NECK TO NECK WITH EACH ONE OF THEM."
Galaxy S3,4,"I HAVE GOT LAST WEEK... ITS A GREAT PHONE.. ITS LOOKING TOO CRAZY AND COOL... SO BEAUTIFUL
      
      SUPERB SPEED. BETTER FUNCTIONALITY.. PORTABLE..
      
      THE PHONE RESOLUTION AND DISPLAY IS TOO CLEAN.. REALLY NATURE FRIENDLY..
      
      GALAXY S3 STANDS FOR COMPETITION TO IPHONE 5."
Galaxy S3,4,"I HAVE ORDERED THE SGS III GARNET RED ON 7TH NOVEMBER 2012 AND RECEIVED IT ON 17TH NOVEMBER 2012, I KNOW ITS A VERY LATE DELIVERY BUT THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF FLIPKART. BECAUSE THE SHIPPED MY ORDER ON 10TH NOVEMBER. ITS THE COURIER COMPANY WHICH MAKES DELAY IN THE DELIVERY.
      
      AFTER A LOT OF ANALYSIS MADE BY ME I SHORTLISTED 4 PHONES :- 1. IPHONE 5 2. SGS III, 3. HTC ONE X 4. SXSL. BUT FROM THE BEGINNING I WANT TO GO WITH IPHONE 5 ONLY BECAUSE OF THE BRAND RELIABILITY AND ITS PREMIUM COMPACT DESIGN. BUT THERE ARE MANY SERVICES OF IPHONE WHICH I CAN'T USE IN INDIA. SO I HAVE DECIDED TO GO WITH SGS III.
      
      
      FROM THE BEGINNING I HAVE DECIDED TO BUY IT THROUGH ONLINE BUT FROM WHERE MADE ME REALLY CONFUSED. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER WEBSITE WHOSE PRICE ARE BIT LESS  FROM FLIPKART. BUT WHY I CHOOSE FLIPKART?? FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A TRUST WORTHY BRAND NOW A DAYS AND SECONDLY I GOT FEW OFFERS THROUGH FLIPKART WHICH NO OTHER ONLINE RETAILER PROVIDES. LIKE    WITH SGS III FLIPKART GIVES A RS. 500 E-GIFT VOUCHER, AND A SAMSUNG BLUETOOTH HEADSET. BUT YESTERDAY WHEN I HAVE OPENED MY COURIER I ALSO GOT A 16GB SANDISK MEMORY CARD WHICH WAS A SURPRISED PACKAGE FOR ME. THAT MEANS I GOT 3 OFFER WHICH WORTH RS. 1920. SO SGS III COSTS 32980/- FOR ME. GREAT DEAL..
      
      
      NOW PACKAGING WISE FLIPKART ROCKS.
      
      WHEN I OPENED MY SGS III BOX AND SEEN THE SGS III GARNET RED . I SAID WOW. WHAT A COLOUR WITH PREMIUM METALLIC FINISH. BUT THE REAR COVER IS BIT DISAPPOINTING BUT IT CAN BE MANAGEABLE WHEN YOU PUT A TPU CASE ON IT. I HAVE ALSO PURCHASED A MUSUBO MU S3 MUMMY CASE FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 FROM FLIPKART. WHICH IS ALSO AWESOME. BY PUTTING THIS COVER ON MY SGS III MAKES MY DEVICE REALLY SOPHISTICATED. THIS IS ALL ABOUT HARDWARE
      
      
      I TELL ABOUT THE USAGE AND BATTER LIFE AFTER I LL USE THIS FOR 1 WEEK.
      
      
      BUT I LL RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO GO WITH SGSIII"
Galaxy S3,4,"I NEVER LIKED SAMSUNG UNTIL I USED THIS GALAXY S3. IN FACT, THIS IS THE ONLY SAMSUNG PHONE I LIKE.
      
      
      BEST SMARTPHONE AT MUCH LOWER PRICE THAN HTC ONE X.
      
      
      TELLING ABOUT FLIPKART, ITS AN AWESOME SITE WHERE YOU CAN BUY THINGS AND EXPECT IT TO REACH YOU THE NEXT DAY OR THE OTHER.
      
      
      BUT, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SUGGEST FLIPKART THAT PLEASE DON'T USE CHEAP COURIER LIKE FIRST FLIGHT, USE BLUEDART INSTEAD.
      
      
      MY S3 WAS SHIPPED ON THE SAME DAY BUT FIRST FLIGHT DIDN'T DELIVER ME ON TIME."
Galaxy S3,4,"I ORDERED GALAXY S III ON 29TH APRIL ON FLIPKART AND RECEIVED IT ON 30TH APRIL, SURPRISED AND HAPPY FOR SUCH A FAST DELIVERY. ALSO THE FACT 01 MAY WAS HOLIDAY, SO GOT GOOD TIME TO SPEND WITH MY NEW GALAXY S III. I BOUGHT IT FOR THE 12 EMI CREDIT CARD OFFER. ABOUT THE OFFER I WOULD SAY IT WAS DEFINITELY A GOOD ONE GIVEN THE FACT I WILL BE GETTING 15% CASH BACK AND HAVE TO PAY ZERO PROCESSING FEES AND  NO INTEREST.
      
      ABOUT THE PRODUCT, I WOULD SAY GALAXY S III IS STILL  MODEST MODERN SMARTPHONE. THE PHONE COMES WITH ICS ANDROID SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THE JELLY BEAN 4.1 UPDATE IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR THE DEVICE. GETTING S III FOR AROUND RS. 25 K WAS REALLY A COOL DEAL FOR A DEVICE WHICH HAS MOST FEATURES OF LATEST ANDROID DEVICES."
Galaxy S3,4,"I THINK THIS PHONE IS PRETTY GOOD. THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE, MY PREVIOUS ONE WAS A BB. S3 IS LIKE HITTING A JACKPOT AFTER THE BB. I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THE OTHER ANDROID PHONES IN THE MARKET, THEIR BATTERY BACKUP, SPECS, ETC. BUT I REALLY DO THINK THE S3 SERVES MY PURPOSE. IT'S NOT JUST A PHONE, IT SERVES AS A MINI TABLET. TO SUM IT UP ITS MULTIPURPOSE. I HARDLY USE MY LAPTOP ANYMORE!"

Galaxy S3,4,"I WAS NEVER GREAT FAN OF SAMSUNG TILL I BOUGHT GALAXY SIII. IT IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. GREAT SPEED, GOOD RAM AND ENOUGH MEMORY. WAT ELSE CAN SOMEONE EXPECT.
      
      PEOPLE SAY THE BUILD QUALITY IS NOT GOOD. BUT I DONT THINK SO. IT FEELS GREAT IN HAND. PEOPLE SHOULD STOP COMPARING THINGS FIRST .
      
      FEATURES IN THE PHONE ARE EXCELLENT... ACTUALLY S VOICE WORKS.....
      
      
      THIS IS WHY IT IS THE WORLD'S BEST LOVED PHONE WITH SUPERB SALES ALL OVER THE WORLD..."
Galaxy S3,4,"I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME. AND FINALLY WHEN MY WALLET WAS SUPPORTING ME, I GRABBED ONE WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY THOUGH THE PRICES WERE FLUCTUATING EVERY WEEK AND FROM ONE WEBSITE TO ANOTHER.
      
      
      IT'S FANTABULOUS.
      
      
      WISH IT HAD A 2GB RAM. BUT FOR THAT..EVERYTHING ELSE IS AWESOME.(4STARS FOR THAT)
      
      
      AS USUAL FLIPKART DELIVERED IT TO ME IN LESS THAN 2 DAYS. THAT'S PICTURE PERFECT COURIER SERVICE."
Galaxy S3,4,"I WOULD LIKE TO CLASSIFY NEEDS OF PEOPLE IN THREE WHEN COMES TO A DECISION MAKING ON PURCHASE OF A TOP END SMART PHONE
      
      
      (1) IF YOU ARE PERSON WHO ALWAYS PREFER LOOKS DO SOME SERIOUS WORK ON PHONE AND STABLE PERFORMANCE FROM APPS AND INTERFACE  FOR IPHONE 5
      
      
      (2) IF YOU LIKE TO SHOOT A PHOTO WITH EXTREME GOOD QUALITY AND NEED TO EXPERIENCE WHAT A AWESOME PICTURE LOOKS LIKE BUT DONT LIKE CARRY A CAMERA WITH YOU AND NEED SOME STANDARD STUFF APPS AND INTERFACE GO FOR NOKIA LUMIA 920
      
      
      (3) IF YOU LIKE ANDROID HAVING ALMOST HALF A MILLION APPS AND PREFER ONLY KING IN THAT S3 WILL DO GR8 JOB FOR YOU. IT WILL PROVIDE BIG SCREEN AND PICTURE RESOLUTION TOO.
      
      
      ONE MORE THING TO ADD IN ALL THREE THESE PHONES AT PRESENT ONLY S3 IS AVAILABLE OTHERS ARE COMING SOON STATUS ONLY SO ALL YOU ARE LEFT OUT WITH ON OPTION S3"
Galaxy S3,4,"ITS A BRILLIANT PIECE OF WORK.
      
      MUST BUY. THE SCREEN IS SUPERB. AMOLED W-O-W !
      
      42 GRAND WAS A BIT MUCH BUT ITS WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!
      
      JUST WISH IF FLIPKART WOULD'VE GOT THE OTHER COLOR TOO.
      
      WANTED TO BUY THAT ONE . BECAUSE THE SCREEN RESOLUTION ENHANCES IN THE 'PEBBLE BLUE' THAN IN THE WHITE ONE.
      
      NEVERTHELESS , ITS A GREAT MOBILE GO FOR IT!"
Galaxy S3,4,"ITS A GREAT PRODUCT NO DOUBT IS THIS. I BOUGHT IT IN DECEMBER 2012 WITH THE FLIP COVER. ITS UPDATED TO LATEST ANDROID.
      
      FIRSTLY IT WORKED GREAT BUT NOW IT TAKES HOURS TO GET FULLY CHARGED. I MEAN MORE THAN 7-8 HOURS BUT IT FINISHED BATTERY VERY FAST. I DIDNT COMPARE IT TO OTHER SMARTPHONES AT THIS RANGE. ALSO THE FLIPCOVER WAS GREAT WHEN NEW. BUT IT REQUIRES VERY MUCH CARE. YOU CANT EVEN SLIDE THE MOBILE ON DESK. MINE GOT MANY SCRATCHES ON THE BACK AS I DIDNT KNEW THAT THE COVER HAS TO BE HANDLED WITH CARE.
      
      ALL IN ALL I HAD GIVEN 4 STARS AS IT WAS THE BEST MOBILE AT THE TIME I BOUGHT IT. ITS WORKING IS AWESOME."
Galaxy S3,4,"ITS BEEN A WEEK I BOUGHT THIS PHONE, AND TRUST ME GUYS, THIS IS A BEAST!!!
      
      THE FIRST THING YOU WILL NOTICE ABOUT THIS PHONE IS, WELL,ITS SIZE. ITS HUGE TO SAY THE LEAST, AND PHONES SHOULDN'T REALLY GET ANY BIGGER THAN THIS. PERSONALLY I FEEL THE SIZE IS BIG FOR A PHONE, AND IS SIMPLY RISKY FOR ONE HANDED USE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LARGER SCREEN ESTATE DOES HELP WHEN BROWSING THE INTERNET, OR WATCHING A VIDEO, ETC.
      
      MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THE BUILD QUALITY OF THIS PHONE, SAYING ITS CHEAP PLASTIC N ALL. WHILE IT DOESN?T LOOK AS PREMIUM AS OTHER FLAGSHIPS, BUT ITS NOT THAT BAD EITHER. YOU WILL BE FOOLED IF YOU JUDGE THE PHONE'S APPEARANCE BY THE PICTURES; IN HAND, IT REALLY LOOKS AND FEELS MUCH BETTER AND STURDY. ALSO, ITS POLYCARBONATE, THE SAME MATERIAL USED ON THE HTC ONE X, SO YOU CAN COMFORTABLY FORGET ABOUT THE BAD COMMENTS ON QUALITY OF MATERIALS.
      
      THE DISPLAY IS ONE OF THE THE BEST DISPLAYS RIGHT NOW IN THE MARKET, PERIOD. SUPER AMOLEDS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR RICH COLORS AND DEEP BLACKS, AND TRUST ME, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT IF YOU HAVEN?T ALREADY. THE BLACKS ARE IMPENETRABLE, AND COLORS POP OUT TO THE EYES. YOU CAN TWEAK DISPLAY SETTINGS IF YOU LIKE MORE NATURAL LOOKING COLORS. FINALLY, THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE PENTILE NATURE OF THE DISPLAY, DON'T BE. AT PIXEL DENSITY OF 306 PPI, YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE THE GRAININESS IN DAY TO DAY USE THAT WAS PREVALENT ON GALAXY S, UNLESS YOU SEE FROM VERY CLOSE RANGE.
      
      THE ICS 4.0.4 UI IS SKINNED BY SAMSUNG TOUCHWIZ NATURE UX. THIS IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT TOUCHWIZ USED TO BE COUPLE OF YEARS BACK, AND REALLY BRINGS A FRESH FEEL TO USER EXPERIENCE, NOT VERY VISUALLY APPEALING AS HTC SENSE, BUT NOT BAD EITHER. THE SOFTWARE RUNS ON EXYNOS QUAD CORE PROCESSOR, THAT COUPLED WITH A MALI 400 GPU AND 1 GB OF RAM, THIS PHONE LITERALLY EATS MOST OTHER PHONES FOR BREAKFAST. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ANDROID DEVICE THIS SMOOTH, THE UI LITERALLY FLIES WITH YOUR TOUCH, AND APPS LAUNCH IN A FLASH; IT JUST REFUSES TO GIVE UP, ITS INSANELY FAST! ALL OF THIS IS POWERED BY A 2100 MAH BATTERY, WHICH IS A REMOVABLE ONE TOO. IT EASILY LASTS A DAY AND A HALF WITH MODERATE TO HEAVY USAGE, AND THE LONGEVITY IS CERTAIN TO INCREASE AFTER A COUPLE OF CHARGE/DISCHARGE CYCLES.
      
      STORAGE OPTION IS PLENTY, AS THIS PHONE COMES WITH 16 GB ONBOARD. IF YOU CRAVE FOR MORE, IT SUPPORTS MICROSD CARD SLOTS OF UPTO 64 GB CAPACITY, SO STORAGE SHOULDN?T BE A PROBLEM FOR MOST.
      
      THE DEFAULT VIDEO PLAYER, AS USUAL, HAS VERY RICH CODEC SUPPORT. I HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME ISSUES WITH .MKV FORMAT, AND REALLY HOPE THIS TO BE FIXED SOON WITH AN UPDATE. THE OTHER POPULAR FORMATS, DIVX/XVID,MP4, FLV, ALL PLAYED WITHOUT ANY ISSUES. 1080P VIDEOS PLAYED SMOOTHLY WITHOUT ANY HICCUPS. THIS PHONE REALLY IS ONE CAPABLE VIDEO PLAYER OOTB.
      
      SAMSUNG HAS INCORPORATED THE TOUCHWIZ MUSIC PLAYER, WITH NEW, POLISHED LOOK. THE PLAYER SUPPORTS ALL POPULAR FORMATS, AND THE PHONE REALLY EXCELS IN THE AUDIO DEPARTMENT, WITH A TOP NOTCH AUDIO OUTPUT. BUY A PAIR OF GOOD HEADPHONES AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO.
      
      CAMERA HAS THE SAME PIXEL COUNT AS ITS PREDECESSOR, THE S2 (8 MP), BUT SAMSUNG HAVE IMPROVED ON THE SENSORS FOR BETTER PICS, WHICH IS A SMART MOVE. FOR ALL WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF A 12 MP UNIT, UNLESS YOU ARE PLANNING TO PRINT BILLBOARD SIZE PHOTOS, ITS REALLY NOT NECESSARY. IMAGE QUALITY DEPENDS ON THE SENSORS. THE ZERO SHUTTER LAG FEATURE WORKS AS EXPECTED. THE CAMERA HAS A COUPLE OF USEFUL SHOT MODES (BURST SHOT, PANORAMA, ETC), WHICH ARE HANDY, BUT I FOUND THAT NOT ALL OF THEM USES THE FLASH, LIKE THE BURST SHOT MODE, SO FORGET IT IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO MAKE A BURST SHOT IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS. THE FRONT CAMERA IS A 1.9 MP MODULE, AND IS PRETTY DECENT AS WELL.
      
      THE CAMERA IS CAPABLE OF RECORDING 1080P VIDEOS IS MP4 FORMAT, AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY CAPTURE 8 MP STILLS WHILE RECORDING THE VIDEO SIMULTANEOUSLY, WHICH IS A NICE FEATURE. I WON'T COMMENT MUCH ON THIS SINCE I HAVEN'T SHOT VIDEOS YET, BUT THE ONLINE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN POSITIVE ABOUT THE VIDEO RECORDER. THE FRONT MODULE IS CAPABLE OF SHOOTING VIDEOS IN 720P.
      
      A COUPLE OF NEGATIVES THAT I HAVE COME ACROSS:-
      
      1) SOME OF THE FEATURES I FEEL ARE MORE OF MARKETING GIMMICKS, LIKE THE SMART STAY FEATURE ONLY WORKS IN A WELL-LIT ENVIRONMENT, AND THAT TOO, THE OPERATION IS NOT GUARANTEED (I PERSONALLY WAS ANNOYED ABOUT THIS FEATURE, AND SAMSUNG ITSELF WARNS ABOUT THE SAME).
      
      2) SURPRISINGLY, SAMSUNG HAS REMOVED/DISABLED THE ICS FEATURE OF DRAG-N-DROP ONE APP SHORTCUT ON ANOTHER TO CREATE A FOLDER, SO YOU HAVE TO GO THE OLD-FASHIONED GINGERBREAD WAY OF CREATION OF FOLDERS.
      
      3) YOU CANNOT MOVE INSTALLED APPLICATIONS TO MEMORY CARD.
      
      IF YOU CONSIDER THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE, THERE ARE NOT MANY PHONES IN MARKET RIGHT NOW WHICH CAN DARE TO STAND TOE-TO-TOE WITH THIS BEAST. ITS NOT PERFECT,  BUT ITS FAR FROM BEING BAD EITHER. IF YOU HAVE THE POCKET AND DO NOT WANT TO GO FOR ANYTHING ELSE BUT THE BEST, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS PHONE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
Galaxy S3,4,"ITS OFFICIALLY PRICE IS RS=28000.           SAMSUNG HAS SLASHED THE PRICE OF THE GALAXY S III YET AGAIN AND IT IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR RS 34,900. THIS IS THE THIRD MAJOR PRICE DROP THE PHONE HAS RECEIVED AFTER ITS LAUNCH IN JUNE."
Galaxy S3,4,"ITS PRICING IS SIMPLY AWESOME HAVVIG ALMOST LAKHS OF APPLICATIONS..
      
      IT IS A CUSTOMER""S ULTIMATE SATISFACTION..UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGY..
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING SAMSUNG S3 SINCE ITS LAUNCH..BEIN A NOKIA
      
      SYMBIAN BEFORE,, THIS PHONE IS HEAVENLY TO USE..
      
      TO START WITH DISPLAY IS VERY SHARP AND VIVID..THOUGH IT
      
      CONSUMES MOST OF THE BATTERY POWERS..
      
      THE BATTERY LIFE DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON THE
      
      USAGE OF AN INDIVIDUAL.
      
      THE PHONE SUPPORTS PRACTICALLY EVERY VIDEO FORMAT YOU MIGHT WANY IT
      
      TO PLAY.IT COMES EQUIPPED WITH 1.4GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR.
      
      TO CONCLUDE WITH THE PHONE IS APERFECT BLEND OF EVERYDAY
      
      USABILITY AND EXCEPTIONAL FEATURES."
Galaxy S3,4,"LET ME CONFESS, I AM A BIG NOKIA FAN BUT WAS REALLY TIRED OF WAITING FOR RELEASE OF LUMIA 920 IN INDIA HENCE DECIDED TO GO FOR S3,
      
      IT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD PHONE IF YOU NEED A TRUE JELLYBEAN EXPERIENCE....SINCE I BOUGHT IT RECENTLY, THE PHONE ALREADY CAME WITH LATEST OS
      
      IT RUNS VERY SMOOTH, WITHOUT ANY LAGGING AND ANDROID MARKET SURELY OFFERS YOU WHATEVER YOU LOOK FOR....I LIKE THAT!
      
      I LOVE THE BIG SCREEN AND AWESOME LIVE WALLPAPERS... THAT'S JUST WOW!!
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT, NOKIA ROCKS THERE!!
      
      I HOPE THEY FOCUS EQUALLY ON HARDWARE AS THEY DID FOR SOFTWARE IN CASE OF S3,PLASTIC IS NOT CHEAP BUT COULD HAVE TRIED ANOTHER MATERIAL I FEEL.
      
      BUT I AM REALLY UPSET WITH SAMSUNG FOR OTHER REASON!!
      
      I HAD TO RUN TO A SERVICE CENTER WITHIN 24HRS OF BUYING IT,IMAGINE!!I HAD RECEIVED A FAULTY DATA CABLE IN THE BOX BECAUSE OF WHICH THE PHONE FAILED TO CHARGE 100%,I GOT THE CABLE REPLACED IMMEDIATELY,BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE UP FOR THE STRESS I HAD TO FACE,I HAVE MY FINGERS ALREADY CROSSED,I HOPE I DONT HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING TO SERVICE CENTER AGAIN AND AGAIN.MY FIRST AND LAST SAMSUNG PHONE.....NOKIA I HOPE YOU CRACK IT WITH WP8,SURELY MY NEXT BUY :), RATING S3 4/5 ONLY BECAUSE OF GOOGLE :)"
Galaxy S3,4,NO MESS. NO FUSS. DELIVERED PROMPTLY AND SAFELY. FLIPKART MENTIONS WARRANTY IN ITS BILL. GREAT PHONE. LEARN ABOUT FEATURES ONLINE BEFORE LOADING UP ON APPS. APPARENTLY THIS REVIEW NEEDS TO HAVE TWO HUNDRED CHARACTERS.
Galaxy S3,4,"OHK,HERE WE GO..
      
      GALAXY S3,A VERY GOOD PHONE IN THE MARKET CATCHING EYES OF EVERYONE  IS NOT AS GOOD AS YOU THINK.I WAS A HTC ONE X USER AND NOW M USING S3 FROM A MONTH.
      
      S3,NO DOUBT IS A WONDERFUL PHONE FEATURES WISE,BUT THAT DOENT MAKES IT WORTH,RYT?
      
      THE PHONE FEELS TOO WEIRD WHEN WE ARE HOLDING IT BECAUSE OF ITS CHEAP PLASTIC MATERIAL.WHILE HTC ONE X USES A BETTER MATERIAL.
      
      CAMERA IS SAME OF BOTH HTC AND S3 I.E BRILLIANT!!
      
      BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SPEED,HTC TAKES THE EDGE.IT IS MUCH MUCH FASTER THAN S3.IT DOESNT HANGS(WHICH S3 DOES MANY TIMES).
      
      HTC'S SOUND QUALITY IS ENHANCED BY BEATS AUDIO WHICH MAKES IT MUCH MORE SOOTHING TO LISTEN.
      
      AND,HTC IS 4K CHEAPER THAN S3!!
      
      GUYS,BELIEVE ME,I HAVE SWITCHED TO S3 FROM HTC ONE X WHICH WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.
      
      ALL I CAN SAY IS,HTC ONE X,IS WAY BETTER THAN S3.
      
      THOUGH,STILL FOR THE FEATURES,I GIVE IT 3.5 STARS COMPARED TO THE ONE X,WHO I GIVE 4.5 STARS!!"
Galaxy S3,4,"ORIGINAL PRODUCT, BRAND NEW, SEALED PACK, DELIVERED IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS, ORIGINAL SOFTWARE, ALL FEATURES AND HARDWARE WORKING NORMALLY, FREE BLUETOOTH INCLUDED, PRICE AS ADVERTISED. I'D HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT I WANTED TO PURCHASE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY BUT COULDN'T FIND THAT OPTION ANYWHERE, AND THE SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER GUYS ARE CLUELESS ABOUT FLIPKART PURCHASES - SO KEEP THAT IN MIND IF YOU USUALLY GO FOR EXTENDED WARRANTIES."
Galaxy S3,4,"PHONE FEATURES ARE PRETTY GOOD, AT SOME 35K IS WORTH GIVING.
      
      DISAPPOINTED WITH BATTERY LIFE THOUGH, THE STANDBY IS SAID TO SOME 400HRS BUT IT HARDLY COMES FOR 1 O 1.5 DAY..
      
      
      ALSO, AT THIS PRICE ATLEAST GIVE A POUCH FOR THE PHONE, A SAMSUNG PHONE OF 3K HAS POUCH BUT 35K DOESN'T. I AM TIRED OF SEARCHING GOOD POUCHES, ALL ARE LOW QUALITY WHICH WOULD HARDLY LAST FOR A MONTH OR TWO.
      
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD, THOUGH VIDEO RECORDING A MIN TAKES AROUND 100MB (LOL :D), TOUCHWIZ COOL!!!CLEARITY IS JUST AMAZING COMPARED WITH IPHONE4S(NOTHING IN FRONT OF S3!!KUDOS)
      
      
      EVEN THE APPLICATIONS WONT CLOSE(KEEP RUNNING IN BACKGROUND), U NEED TO KILL APPLIACTIONS EVERYTIME ELSE UR BATTERY WILL DRAIN LIKE HELL...
      
      
      OVERALL!!! WORTH BUYING IT 35K MONEY GOOD SPENT..BEST PHONE IN MARKET FOR NOW..
      
      
      AS ALWAYS THE BEST FLIPKART DELIVERY!!!"
Galaxy S3,4,"PRETTY NICE NEW MOBILE GOT IN A NICE PACKAGING FROM FLIPKART WITHIN 2 DAYS OF ORDER WITH AN AWESOME TRACKING OF SHIPMENT ON THE FLIPKART SITE.
      
      
      BATTERY BACKUP NOT UP TO THE EXPECTATION. WHILE WORKING THROUGH OUT ON WIFI, GETS DISCHARGED IN 8-9 HOURS. WITH DISPLAY OFF IT CAN GIVE BETTER RESULTS WITH THE BATTERY BACKUP. SENSORS KEEP PHONE DISPLAY ON WHEN YOU KEEP THE PHONE NEAR TO YOUR FACE. RECEPTION OF SIGNAL IS NOT SO NICE BUT CALLS GO ON W/O ANY TROUBLE, FACED TROUBLE IN NET BROWSING ONLY, EVEN WHEN BROWSING IN 3G NETWORK(MAY BE ITS BECAUSE OF RURAL LOCATION AS DIDN'T FACE ANY PROBLEM IN THE CITY :) ).
      
      GAMING IS ULTIMATE BUT AS COMPARED TO IPHONE A BIT SLOWER INTERFACE, BUT DECENT OTHERWISE. NET OVER WIFI IS GOOD.
      
      
      PHONE GETS HEATED WHEN USED CONTINUOUSLY EVEN FOR 1-2 HOURS. WELL, YOU WILL NOT ENJOY IT WITHOUT HAVING A BACK COVER. I HAVE A SILICON BACK COVER SO CAN IGNORE IT.
      
      OVERALL EXPERIENCE NICE EXCEPT BATTERY BACKUP, WEB BROWSING AND HEATING OF PHONE, THE PHONE IS AWESOME WITH MAMMOTH SCREEN SIZE. PHONE IS WORTH BUYING..."
Galaxy S3,4,"S3 IS MY FIRST SMARTY AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A MONTH NOW. I DID TONS OF RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING IT. THE ONLY THING I WAS WORRYING BEFORE BUYING WAS ITS SIZE. BUT AFTER BUYING, THE SIZE DOESN'T BOTHERS A LOT. YOU CAN GET USED TO IT IN A SHORT SPAN.
      
      
      BATTERY: AM HONESTLY SAYING , FOR MY USAGE , 30MIN OF CALL, 3G ALL THE DAY, HALF AN HOUR OF HD GAMES, 20 MIN OF VIDEO PLAYBACK ,60 MIN OF BROWSING, BATTERY LASTS FOR 17-18 HOURS. I FEEL ITS DECENT. ALSO IT TAKES 90MIN TO GET FULLY CHARGED FROM 20%.
      
      
      LOOK: AS WE ALL KNOW, ITS VERY PLASTIC. YO HAVE TO BUY A COVER AS SOON AS YO BUY. OTHERWISE IT WILL SOON GET SCRATCH MARKS ON ITS BACK.
      
      
      DESIGN: ONE THING I DON'T LIKE FROM SAMSUNG IS ITS DESIGN CONCEPT. FROM S-DUES TO S4, THERE IS NO BIG CHANGE IN DESIGN CONCEPT. PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE IT.
      
      
      DISPLAY: SUPER AMOLED. SO IT LOOKS VERY CRISP. VIEWING ANGLES ARE ALSO GREAT. BUT UNDER DIRECT SUNLIGHT, WE NEED TO ADJUST THE BRIGHTNESS TO ITS MAX. I DO NOTICE IN MY SCREEN SOME DARK PATCHES. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS ONLY IN MY PRODUCT. YOU CAN CHECK THIS BY- OPEN CAMERA WITHOUT FLASH IN COMPLETELY DARK ROOM AND TAKE A SNAP. LOOK INTO THAT IMAGE IN A DARK ROOM.
      
      
      CAMARA: ONE OF THE BEST IN THIS RANGE.
      
      
      RAM: 1GB. IT SEEMS TO BE LESS AT THIS POINT OF TIME. 400MB IS ALWAYS OCCUPIED BY INTERNAL APP AND OS. 2GB WOULD BE MUCH BETTER.
      
      
      PROCESSOR: ITS VERY RESPONSIVE. ALL THE GAMES RUNS VERY SMOOTHLY. BUT GOING INTO DIALLER TAKING 4-5SEC EVERY TIME WHICH IS IRRITATING WHEN YOU ARE IN A URGE .
      
      
      OVERALL AM SATISFIED WITH THIS BUDDY:)
      
      
      PS: I BOUGHT THIS FOR 26.7K AS A CORPORATE OFFER . ITS WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT :)"
Galaxy S3,4,"SAMSUNG HAS LAUNCHED 2 VARIANTS OF S3 ONE IS QUAD CORE AND ANOTHER IS DUAL CORE.
      
      DUAL CORE IS HAVING 2GB OF RAM WHILE QUAD CORE IS HAVING 1GB OF RAM.
      
      
      INDIAN S3 MODELS HAVE 1GB OF RAM AND NOT 2GB.
      
      HOWEVER PHONE IS NICE AND FAST AND CERTAINLY BETTER THAN HTC ONE X."
Galaxy S3,4,"SAMSUNG MOBILE IS GOOD BUT I THINK HTC ONE-X IS BETTER THAN SAMSUNG GALAXY S3.
      
      I AM A FAN OF THE DESIGN ASPECT OF HTC AND ALWAYS SAY THIS IS WHERE SAMSUNG LACKS MOST, BUT NOW HTC FOR THE FIRST TIME IS USING A POLYCARBONATE CASING INSTEAD OF THEIR DEFAULT ALUMINIUM CASING. SO, WE NEED TO SEE HOW IT FEELS IN YOUR HAND, DOES IT GIVE A PLASTIC FEELING LIKE THE S2, OR A PREMIUM FEELING LIKE OTHER HTC OR APPLE PHONES."
Galaxy S3,4,"STARTED TO EXPLORE THE DEVICE. AFTER SOME HICCUPS IN THE START, REGARDING SIM INSERTION, THINGS WENT SMOOTHLY. LIKED THE FLOW WITH WHICH THE APPS CAN BE ACCESSED. AND TO MENTION GREATLY ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE IN CHATTING. ITS A GREAT PHONE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CHAT-PHILIA'S."

Galaxy S3,4,THE BEST PART ABOUT THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 UNDOUBTEDLY IS ITS DISPLAY....WATCHING HD VIDEOS AND BROWSING GIVES U AN ALMOST SURREAL EXPERIENCE BCOZ OF ITS AMOLED SCREEN.....AS ITS BEEN SAID MANY TIMES THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK OF THIS CELLPHONE IS ITS POOR BUILD QUALITY....FOR SUCH A PREMIUM SMARTPHONE WITH PREMIUM FEATURES IT DEFINITELY IS A DISAPPOINTMENT...BUT EVEN THEN I FEEL THIS IS THE BEST SMARTPHONE AT THIS PRIZE RANGE BCOZ IT PREETY MUCH TICKS ALL THE BOXES....TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT BUYING THIS HANDSET CAN GO AHEAD AND BUY IT OR PROBABLY WAIT FOR THE RELEASE OF XPERIA Z OR GALAXY S4 FROM SAMSUNG WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO RELEASE SHORTLY IN THE INDIAN MARKET BUT WHICH WILL ALSO MAKE UR POCKETS LIGHTER BY 35K TO 40K....THR IS NOTHING MUCH TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GALAXY S3 AND HTC ONE X(ONE OF THE COMPETITORS) EXCEPT THAT THE LATTER HAS A BETTER FINISHING AND BETTER SOUND QUALITY BUT THE HTC ONE X STILL COSTS MORE THAN 30K WHICH IS WAY HIGHER THAN THE S3.....THE PRICE TAG HAS NOW BECOME A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE FOR THE S3 AND ITS BCOZ OF SUCH SMART MARKETING STRATEGIES THT SAMSUNG HAS BEEN A LEADING BRAND IN THE SMARPHONE SEGMENT....BUY IT FOLKS...DIS PHONE IS NOT GOIN TO DISAPPOINT U....ITS PURE VALUE FOR MONEY WHIC AT THE END OF THE DAY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR US INDIAN CONSUMERS....:)
Galaxy S3,4,"THE DELIVERY WAS ON TIME.
      
      THE SERVICE IS REALLY GOOD.
      
      THE SUPPORT FROM CUSTOMER CARE REGARDING THE REDEMTION OF OFFER WAS GOOD.
      
      
      UNFORTUANTELY I HAVE STILL NOT RECIEVED THE 32GB MEMORY CARD AS PART OF WEB REDEMTION OFFER.

Galaxy S3,4,"THE SAMSUNG S3 IS A MASTERPIECE BUT PEOPLE FEEL CHEATED DUE IT PLASTICKY FEEL. BUT IT'S NOT THE CASE. THE PLASTIC USED IS GOOD IF NOT GREAT. EVEN THE ONE X IS MADE UP OF PLASTIC BACK COVER BUT ONLY IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT. SAMSUNG PLAYED WITH FIRE BY INCLUDING THE S-VOICE. SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE KNOW THAT IT COULD LAND IN TROUBLE WITH APPLE! SAYING THAT THE S-VOICE IS NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE AS THE SIRI. THE TOUCHWIZ IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
      
      
      I FEEL SAMSUNG GOT OVER-CONFIDENT REGARDING THE PRICE. THEY MUST HAVE FELT THAT THEY WOULD SELL AS MANY SETS AS THE S2. BUT THERE WAS NO OPTION FOR THE S2. THERE IS FOR THE S3, AND WHAT A CHALLENGER IT IS. THE ONE X GIVE S3 A RUN FOR ITS MONEY. THE HARDWARE IS THE SAME AND ONE HARDLY FINDS ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE EVEN THOUGH THE BENCHMARKS SAY OTHERWISE.
      
      ANYWAY THERE IS NO REAL WINNER IN THE S3 VS. ONE X BATTLE. THE S3 WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GOOD IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE ONE X.
      
      
      ITS A PERSONAL CHOICE AND FOR ME THE ONE X IS THE BEST PHONE IN THE MARKET SO FAR!!"
Galaxy S3,4,THIS PHONE IS ONE OF THE BEST PHONES IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW ALONG WITH GALAXY NOTE. BUT I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT NOTE IS BETTER AS IT'S DESIGN IS WAY BETTER THAN S3...EXCEPT FOR SBEAM AND SMART STAY...I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS ANY OTHER FEATURE THAT DISTINGUISHES IT FROM NOTE.....N BESIDES....THE PLASTIC LUKS VERY VERY CHEAP FOR A 39000 FONE...
Galaxy S3,4,"THIS PRODUCT BY SAMSUNG IS SO CLOSE TO GETTING A 5*
      
      
      THE AWESOMENESS BUT FOR:
      
      1&GT;WI FI: THE RECEPTION IS POOR. WHEN I LAPTOP SHOWS HAVING FULL WIFI RANGE, THE PHONE SHOWS TO BE OUT OF RANGE.
      
      2&GT;CALL LOG AND MESSAGE: HAS A BUG WHERE IN IT ALWAYS SHOWS THAT THERE IS A MISSED CALL OR AN UNREAD MESSAGE. AND ITS REALLY IRRITATING TO SEE MESSAGE LOGS BEING LISTED IN THE CALL LOGS. EVERY TIME YOU HAVE TO SELECT THE OPTION VIEW CALL LOGS ONLY.
      
      3&GT;SPEED: INITIALLY THERE WAS NOT EVEN A NANO SECOND LAG WHEN YOU GOTO THE HOME SCREEN OR THE APPS. NOW I DO SEE THAT THERE IS A LAG.
      
      4&GT;SAMSUNG COVER(IT DOESNT COME WITH THE PHONE): THE COVER IS NOT AT ALL WORTH PAYING 1.5K. INITIALLY I DID FEEL THAT ITS GOOD, BUT NOW IT HAS CHANGED. ITS UNCONFORTABLE TO CLICK PHOTOS WITH THE COVER. THE LINING OF THE COVER CAME OUT WITHIN A MONTH.
      
      5&GT;HOME BUTTON: HOME BUTTON IS NOT ALL THAT GOOD, NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IN A PREMIUM PHONE LIKE S3
      
      6&GT;NOT A STATUS SYMBOL: YOU`LL HARDLY SEE THE WOW EFFECT IN PPL WHEN THEY SEE THE PHONE.
      
      7&GT;AVERAGE BATTERY: BATTERY LIFE IS AVERAGE. AND WITH 3G ITS BELOW AVERAGE.
      
      8&GT;S-VOICE: PATHETIC. IT HARDLY IDENTIFIES ANYTHING. AND THE EXPLANATION GIVEN BY SAMSUNG STORE IN FORUM MALL, KORAMANGALA BANGALORE WAS THAT I SHOULD SPEAK IN UK ACCENT AND ONLY THEN IT`LD UNDERSTAND. GIVE ME A BREAK!!!
      
      9&GT;S-BEAM: NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO TRY, AS IT WORKS ONLY FROM S3 TO S3. SO ITS A WASTE.
      
      10&GT;EARPHONES: NOT ALL THAT GREAT, GIVES A WEIRD FEELING WHEN YOU WEAR IT, AS IF THERE IS A VACUUM CREATED INSIDE YOUR EAR.
      
      
      APART FROM THESE THE PHONE IS AWESOME. CAM IS GOOD, MUSIC QUALITY IS AWESOME(PROBABLY BECAUSE I'VE BOSE EARPHONES). AWESOME SCREEN AND DOESN'T FEEL ALL THAT BIG IN YOUR HANDS.
      
      
      AWESOME PHONE, HOWEVER ITS NOT WORTH 39K."
Galaxy S3,4,"WELL IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT S3 THEN PROBABLY YOU ARE A DINOSAUR.NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ITS PERHAPS THE BEST MOBILE MONEY CAN BUY AND IS GREAT FOR FLAUNTING,BUT PERHAPS 38K FOR A PHONE MAY NOT BE VERY GOOD IDEA FOR MOST ,AS PHONE AFTER ALL IS A PHONE ONLY AND CALLER IS NOT GOING TO POP OUT OF SCREEN IF YOU ARE CALLING FROM S3 BUT ITS A GREAT THING AS A STYLE STATEMENT,JUST LIKE AN AUDI OR BMW INFRONT OF A VOLKSWAGEN AS AFTER ALL AN AUDI IS NOT GOING TO CARRY A BAARAAT AND IN INDIA MOST OF THE CARS ARE TRAVELLING AT ROUGHLY SAME VELOCITY,THIS HOLDS TRUE FOR MOBILES TOO AS MOST OF THE THINGS CAN BE DONE IN 8-10K PHONE TOO AS 90% OF FUNCTIONS ARE NEVER USED AFTER 2 WEEKS OF PURCHASE.
      
      SO OVERALL GOOD PHONE BUT UTILITYWISE ITS GOING TO DO SAME THINGS AS A 10-15K PHONE , NOTHING MORE"
Galaxy S3,4,"WELL, AFTER PAYING AROUND 38K IT WAS OBVIOUS  THAT THE FEEL WOULD BE SIMPLY AMAZING WHICH IT IS. GREAT SERVICE BY FLIPKART. DELIEVERED WITHIN A DAY PROVIDED I LIVE IN BANGALORE ONLY.
      
      S3 HAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL.
      
      IT FEELS GOOD IN HAND. THE TOUCH,UI, SCREEN RESOLUTION EVERYTHING IS GOOD.
      
      THE SOFTWARES LIKE S VOICE, FACE TAGGING, BURST SHOT, SMART STAY, BUDDY SHARING, POP UP PLAY AND AUTO CALL ARE VERY POLISHED AND MAKE S3 DIFFERENT FROM HTC ONE X.
      
      
      PHONE GETS HOT VERY SOON. ITS BEEN 2 DAYS SINCE I BOUGHT IT AND I HAVE FOUND THIS PROBLEM.
      
      SOUND QUALITY IS NICE BUT NOT EXCEPTIONALLY WELL."
Galaxy S3,3,"1. PRICE
      
      
      SAMSUNG ACHIEVED TOP POSITION IN MOBILE WORLD DUE TO BEST HARDWARE AT AGGRESSIVE PRICING BUT HTC ONE-X IS QUAD CORE TOO CLOCKED AT 1.5 GHZ AND AVAILABLE AT LESSER PRICE.
      
      
      2. RESOLUTION
      
      
      RESOLUTION OF 720 X 1280 PIXELS IS VERY PROMISING AND PRODUCES A REALISTIC DISPLAY QUALITY WITH HIGH CONTRAST AND SHARP LOOKING IMAGES.
      
      
      3. SCREEN
      
      
      ACCORDING TO A CONSUMER SURVEY 4 INCH SCREENS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR SINGLE HAND USE WHEREAS SCREENS LIKE 5.3 OF NOTE AND 4.8 OF S3 HAVE REDUCED THE MOBILITY COMFORT IN MOBILES. PEOPLE END UP USING BOTH HANDS TO OPERATE SUCH LARGE SCREENS. NOT TO MENTION THE INCREASED RISK OF SCREEN CRACKING DUE TO INEVITABLE ROUGH USAGE. OTHERWISE AMOLED SCREEN QUALITY IS PHENOMENAL.
      
      
      4. BATTERY
      
      
      BATTERY (2100 MAH) IS QUITE IMPRESSIVE AND WORKS BEYOND EXPECTATIONS ON HEAVY DUTY OF SUCH LARGE SCREEN AND QUAD CORE PROCESSOR.
      
      
      5. BUILD QUALITY
      
      
      PEOPLE MIGHT LIKE ROUNDED CORNERS AND PLASTIC FINISH BUT PERSONALLY I FEEL THE CHEAP LOOKING PLASTIC DESIGN IS TOY LIKE AND DOESN'T GIVES A PREMIUM LOOK. ITS A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE.
      
      
      6. CAMERA
      
      
      CAMERA IS 8MP SAME AS THAT OF GALAXY S2 WITH IMPROVED INTERFACE AND COLOR SHARPNESS. COURTESY- ANDROID V4 ICS. FRONT CAMERA IS ALSO PROVIDED.
      
      
      7. GRAPHICS
      
      
      GRAPHICS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPROVED, SAME OLD MALI-400MP AS THAT OF GALAXY S2. BUT QUAD CORE MAKES ITS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS.
      
      
      8. OTHER FEATURES
      
      
      HOWEVER SAMSUNG HAS ALWAYS AMAZED ITS CUSTOMERS BY SETTING NEW BENCHMARKS IN MOBILE WORLD. ANDROID ICE-CREAM SANDWICH IS ICING ON THE CAKE. S VIEW AND S STAY THOUGH NEW FEATURES BUT ARE LITTLE UNREAL IN THE FAST WORLD WHERE WE CANT WAIT AND PRESS FOR LONG, SPEAK TO MIKE, WAIT FOR SYSTEM RESPONSE AND THEN AFFIRM. PHEW ! A BIT LENGTHY PROCESS, I WOULD RATHER TOUCH THE APP ICON.
      
      
      9. FINAL WORDS AND LOGICAL PREDICTIONS.
      
      
      S3 IS SO FAR BEST IN HARDWARE BUT ALL ITS EXPENSIVE FEATURES ARE NOT MUCH USABLE IN MARKET LIKE INDIA FOR EXAMPLE THEIR IS HARDLY ANY APP THAT CAN USE ALL THE FOUR QUADS OF ITS PROCESSOR. BUT YES THIS IS A FUTURE PROOF HANDSET AT OVERPRICED TAG. PRICES ARE BOUND TO FALL IN COMING MONTHS BECAUSE:
      
      1. FESTIVAL SEASON IS COMING
      
      2. INDIAN RUPEE IS WEAKEST AT THE MOMENT
      
      3. HYPE OF GALAXY S3 HAS INFLATED ITS INITIAL PRICE
      
      
      ITS PASSIONATE TO BUY THIS PHONE BUT NOT WISE."
Galaxy S3,3,"A LITTLE BACKGROUND - I BOUGHT THE SG TAB 7.0, 8.9 AND 10.1 (YES ALL 3 FOR ME AND MY FAMILY MEMBERS) SINCE FEB 2011. SO I KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY, THE SPECS, THE H/W THE S/W AND ALL..I HAVE BEEN USING THE 7.0 TAB EVERYDAY FOR LAST 1.5 YRS. AM A TECHIE, A MAJOR GADGET BUFF - AND HARDCORE SAMSUNG LOYAL (I CONVINCED MY FAMILY WHO WANTED IPADS THAT SAMSUNG TABS WERE MILES AHEAD).
      
      
      I HAD BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THE S3 VERY EAGERLY (EVEN TUNED INTO THE LIVE BROADCAST OF PRODUCT LAUNCH ON MAY 3RD). I WAS ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT I WOULD BUY THIS PHONE - NO QUESTIONS. BUT I AM HAPPY THAT I DID NOT PREORDER AND WAITED FOR IT TO HIT THE STORES.
      
      
      A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTED ABOUT PAYING 39K FOR PLASTIC - LET ME CLARIFY A BIT - THE ACTUAL FRONT AND REAR COVER IS QUITE SLICK AND DOES NOT LOOK CHEAP. HOWEVER THE SILVER BAND BETWEEN THESE 2 HAS A SCRATCHED-METAL LOOK - AND IT REEKS OF A PLASTICY LOOK - ITS SO BAD THAT YOU CAN SEE JOINTS AT THE LOWER END (NOT VISIBLE IN PHOTOS - POSSIBLY PHOTOSHOPPED OUT).
      
      
      THAT ASIDE I REALLY DONT SEE TRUE ""VALUE"" OF PAYING 39K FOR THE S3 - S VOICE IS EASILY SUBSTITUTED BY NUMEROUS (AND EVER IMPROVING) VOICE-ASSISTANT APPS ON GOOGLE PLAY. THERE ARE OTHER SENSOR-BASED APPLICATIONS TO SPRUCE UP YOUR CURRENT ANDROID SMARTPHONE TO ALMOST S3 LEVELS. POP-UP PLAY THOUGH GOOD IS IMPRACTICAL.
      
      
      BASICALLY IF WE WERE TO HONESTLY ASSESS THE NEW S3 FEATURES AND THEIR ACTUAL VALUE ADDITION TO IMPROVING YOUR DAILY LIFE - IT IS ALMOST NEGLIGIBLE - IMHO.
      
      
      IF IT IS THE NOVELTY FACTOR OR TOY/AMUSEMENT FACTOR OF HAVING THE LATEST AND POP-UP, SMART STAY, SMART DIAL ETC THEN BY ALL MEANS GO AHEAD - ITS ALL THERE (AND IN MY OPINION BETTER THAN HTC ONE X). BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ""VALUE"" FOR YOUR HARD EARNED 39K THEN I SUGGEST GO WITH SOMETHING ELSE.
      
      
      39K IS AN ATTEMPT TO MILK THE INDIAN CONSUMER AND A LOYAL FAN BASE. 30-32K WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD PRICE POINT FOR THIS PHONE - IT WOULD HAVE SMASHED ALL RECORDS! PERSONALLY I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BY SAMSUNGS PRICING. I CANNOT SAY I AM AS STRONG A SAMSUNG LOYAL AS BEFORE - I SHALL NOW BE OPEN TO EVALUATING OTHER OPTIONS ESP. HTC."
Galaxy S3,3,"BEFORE BUYING COMPARE THE S 3 WITH XPERIA S AND HTC ONE X. I ONLY FIND THE BATTERY OF S3 BETTER THAN XPERIA S. ALL ELSE MORE OR LESS THE SAME. YOU SHOULD GET THE VALUE FOR MONEY SPEND. I AM AN XPERIA S USER. I WILL NOT SAY IT IS THE BEST BUT WHEN U COMPARE THE FEATURES WITH S3, IT COMES AS A ALTERNATIVE."
Galaxy S3,3,"FILPKART DELIVERED MY GALAXY S3 WITHIN 24 HOURS FROM MY ORDER. SEVICE AT IT'S BEST..!!   :)
      
      PACKING WAS FINE.
      
      
      ABOUT DEVICE-
      
      
      YOU GET ONLY ~11 GB OF INTERNAL MEMORY. IT HAD ANDROID V4.0.4 OUT OF THE BOX.
      
      IT WAS WORKING ONLY FINE. IT GAVE LAG EVEN IN BASIC GAMES LIKE SUBWAY SURFERS AND TEMPLE RUN.
      
      
      GETS WORSE.
      
      
      AFTER UP-GRADING IT TO ANDROID V4.1.1, IT'S GIVING ME AN EXPERIENCE OF A LOW END TOUCH-SCREEN MOBILE PHONE.
      
      
      THE LIVE WALLPAPERS RESET AUTOMATICALLY. RINGTONE ALSO BECOMES DEFAULT ONE.
      
      THE DEVICE HEATS UP BADLY EVEN AFTER USING IT FOR ONLY 15-20 MINS.
      
      THE PROCESSOR SOMETIMES FAILED TO LOAD HIGH GRAPHICS GAME LIKE BLOOD &AMP; GLORY, ASPHALT 7 ETC.
      
      
      HAVING A TOUGH TIME KEEPING MY PATIENCE HANDLING THE LAG AND OTHER DYSFUNCTIONALITIES, COZ DEVICES LIKE S3 ARE NOT EXPECTED TO GIVE SERVICE LIKE THIS.
      
      
      SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES FACED SAME PROBLEM WITH ANDROID V4.1.1.
      
      HOPEFULLY THE NEXT UPDATE V.4.1.2 RESOLVES THE ISSUES."
Galaxy S3,3,"HELLO GUYS THERE. WELL IAM WRITING A USER REVIEW.ITS REALLY IMPORTANT.NOW WE TALK ABOUT SAMSUNG GALAXY3. I MUST SAY ITS A TOTAL HYPE TO ATTRACT INDIAN CUSTOMERS.I HAVE USED A SAMMY GS3 IT BELONGS TO MY BROTHER BUT I OWN HTC ONE X. BUT WOW THE DIFFERENCE  IS DEFINATELY THERE. HTC ONE X IS BETTER IN ANY TERMS. ACTUALLY SAMMY IS JUST TOO CHEAP PLASTIC BODY HANDSET WHICH LOOKS LIL OFF THE MARK. WHEREAS HTC ONE X IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PHONE EVER DESIGNED.ITS UNIBODY CASE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.AND THE CAMERA IS VERY GOOD.AS FAR AS SCREEN IS CONCERNED HTC ONE X HAS BETTER SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY, MEANS U CAN SEE THINGS FAR MORE BETTER IN SUNGLIGHT. WHEREAS, GS3 FADES IN SUNLIGHT.U CAN HARDLY C IN FULL BRIGHT DAY.AND WHEN IT COMES TO PERFORMANCE BOTH R EQUALLY GOOD.RATHER VERY SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER.BOTH PHONES ARE A BIT LAGGY AT TIMES WITH JUST A MINOR GLITCHES.BUT JELLYBEAN 4.1 WILL DECIDE THE FUTURE OF BOTH. HARDWARE ON BOTH IS DAMN GOOD.BUT VALUE FOR MONEY GOES TO HTC ONE X BECAUSE U GET EXACTLY THE SAME FEATURES IN HTC ONE X AS IN GS3.AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SPACE. THEN I GUESS EVEN FOR A PROFESSIONAL USER 32 GB IS JUST ENOUGH MEMORY. SO NEVER BOTHER ABOUT EXPANDABLE MEMORY OF GS3. USER INTERFACE--- HTC SENSE 4.0 WITH ICE CREAM SANDWITCH IS DAMN GOOD. IT REALLY MAKES SENSE WITH THOSE BEAUTIFUL WIDGETS AND HOME SCREEN. WHERE AS GS3 THE UI IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. (PERSONAL OPINION). I HATE THE WIDGETS. THEY LOOK LIKE KIDS PLAY. RATHER MY BRO KEEPS PLAYING WITH MY PHONE RATHER THAN HIS OWN GS3. HAHA. CONCLUSION--- HTC IS BETTER IN ANYWAYS AND VALUE FOR MONEY AND A GOOD UNIBODY DESIGN. AND I NEVER INTEND TO HURT NY1S DECISION. THIS WAS ONLY A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND OPINION. THANX"
Galaxy S3,3,"I AM GETTING AN PIECE OF PLASTIC FOR WHOOPING 37K.... NOT WORTH IT... SONY XPERIA SL OR ION IS LOT BETTER AND PROBABLY WAY CHEAPER THAN THIS ONE. HTC ONE X IS ALSO BETTER CHOICE... DON'T FALL FOR THE QUAD CORE PROCESSOR. YOU ARE NOT STEPHEN HAWKINGS TO RUN SOME CRAZY SOFTWARE ON MOBILE... AS FAR AS SOFTWARE IS CONCERNED, IT IS ALL ANDROID AND HENCE NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE AT THE CORE... BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION PROVIDED BY SONY IS REALLY AWESOME.. JUST TRY IT ONCE AND PROBABLY YOU WILL NEVER LOOK BACK...
      
      
      AND IF YOU REALLY LOOKING FOR CHANGE, THEN I WILL SUGGEST TO WAIT FOR LUMIA 920. FEW OF MY FRIENDS ARE HAVE BOUGHT LUMIA 800 AND ARE SIMPLY DAZZLED BY WP PLATFORM.. IT'S SIMPLY UNIQUE"
Galaxy S3,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN UNIVERCELL, EVERYTHING WORKS FINE AND LOOKS GREAT. AFTER THREE DAYS MY CAMERA STOPPED WORKING AND WENT TO SERVICE CENTER THEY CHANGED THE SOFTWARE AND THEN CAMERA STARTED WORKING. I TOOK SOME PICTURES AND  DOWNLOADED TO MY PC AND SHOCKED TO SEE THE PICTURES ARE IN VERY LOW QUALITY AND THEN AGAIN WENT TO SERVICE CENTER , THEY SAID LOOKS LIKE A PROBLEM WITH CAMERA THEY AGREE TO FIX IT BY ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS.  WILL UPADATE ONCE I RECEIVE THE PHONE BY NEXT WEEK. FELT VERY BAD AFTER SPENDING 38000  THE PRODUCT SUCKS WITH THE BASIC FEATURE"
Galaxy S3,3,"I DON'T KNOW... THE PLASTIC CASE, AND THE LIMITED COLORS... GET TO ME, AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY. I JUST COMPARED THIS TO THE HTC DROID DNA AND THE DNA IS MORE SOLID. BUT, I NEED SOMETHING ON AT&AMP;T'S 4GLTE. I AM IN THE U.S. (ATLANTA) AND NEED SPEED, MOST OF ALL, FOR PHONE CALLS BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS. IN THIS REGARD, IT'S PROBABLY A TOSS-UP."
Galaxy S3,3,"I HAD ORDERED MY ONE X FROM FLIPKART THOUGH I THOUGHT I WAS MISSING OUT ON THIS ONE AND WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT BUYING THE ONE X...MY DAD'S OLD NOKIA WAS GIVING UP ON THE BATTERY AND HENCE HE BOUGHT THIS FROM THE RETAILER HERE.
      
      
      LET ALONE THOSE QUADRANT SCORES AND BENCHMARKS,WHEN I COMPARED THIS TO MY ONE X IN DAILY USE, THIS CRAPPY PLASTIC BOX IS UGLY ALL THE WAY...I AM USING THE ONE X AND OH BOY IT JUST BEATS S3 NO BRAINER, REMEMBER THIS WAS MY FIRST HTC PHONE SO I AM NOT BIASED IN ANY WAYS.
      
      
      ALTHOUGH S3 IS 3-4% FASTER IN BENCHMARKS, IF YOU COMPARE REAL TIME PERFORMANCE, ONE X MURDERS S3 STRAIGHT AWAY...AND THOSE WHO THINK AMOLED HD IS THE BEST DISPLAY, TRY OUT ONE X'S SUPER IPS LCD 2, YOU WON'T EVER GO BACK TO AMOLED PLUS HD.MOREOVER, MY ONE X HAS A QUADRANT SCORE OF 4981 VS S3'S 5120 AND ANTUTU SCORE OF 11200 VS 11450...TEGRA ULP 12CORE GPU ON MY PHONE BEATS S3'S OLD MALI400 EASY...PLEASE USE IT FIRST AT YOUR RETAILER AND THEN CHOOSE..MY RISK WHICH I PRESUMED TO BE SO, ACTUALLY TURNED OUT IN MY FAVOUR...... HTC ONE X &GT; GALAXY S3
      
      
      PS: DON'T LET ALL THOSE BENCHMARKS FOOL YOU, REAL TIME PERFORMANCE ON THE ONE X IS SUPERIOR TO THE S3."
Galaxy S3,3,"I JUST BOUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY S II SKYROCKET I727(IT'S AT&AMP;T'S US MODEL) FROM EBAY. RIGHT AFTER RELEASING SGS III.
      
      I PREFERRED THIS MODEL BECAUSE THIS MOBILE GIVING ME EXTRA 0.3"" SCREEN THAN INDIAN S2 AS WELL AS 1.5GH PROCESSOR WHEREAS INDIAN S2 HAS 1.2GH ONLY. ALSO ITS CAPACITIVE BUTTONS ARE NICE.
      
      
      WELL THIS IS ABOUT MY SGS II SKYROCKET.
      
      NOW S3
      
      I WAS ALSO LOOKING FOR SGS III BUT WHEN I SEEN THIS S2 WHICH I PURCHASED I JUST LOVED IT.
      
      
      1-SIZE-&GT;S3-4.8"" &AMP; S2-4.3"" OR 4.5"". SO S3 DOESN'T FITS IN MY POCKET WHEREAS S2 MAKES IT PERFECT.

      THIS KIND OF CONFIG NEED IF YOUR HARDCORE GAMER. BOTH PHONES CAN PLAY EVERY KIND OF GAME,SOFTWARE,LIVE WALLPAPERS WITHOUT ANY LAG.

      3-CAMERA &AMP; FEATURES-&GT; S3-8MP &AMP; S2-8MP.
      
      BOTH ARE GOOD AT ITS. S3 HAS GIVEN SOME MORE FEATURES LIKE BURST SHOT AND 0 SHUTTER LAG.
      
      THIS KIND OF FEATURE NOT INCLUDED IN S2. MAYBE YOU CAN GET IT ON JELLY BEAN.
      
      SO HERE S3 WINS WITH ITS FEATURES.
      
      
      4-BATTERY-&GT; ITS BIG ISSUES ON EVERY ANDROID PHONE.
      
      BUT IN S3 THIS BIG JUICE MAKES US ENJOYABLE OVER THE DAY.
      
      BUT NOT S2.
      
      SO HERE S3 WINS AGAIN.
      
      
      AND ABOUT S3'S NEW FEATURES LIKE SVOICE, SBEAM, ETC.
      
      WELL YOU GUYZ ALSO ENJOY THESE FEATURES IF YOU UPGRADED YOUR S2 ON ICS OR JELLY BEAN. WELL WE NEED TO WAIT FOR JB.
      
      IN MY MOBILE SBEAM IS HERE AFTER I UPGRADING IT TO ICS.
      
      &AMP; AM ALSO ENJOYING SVOICE TOO.
      
      
      SO IF YOU ARE GADGET FREAK LIKE ME THEN YOU CAN GO FOR S3
      
      (BUT I DIDN'T GO FOR IT).
      
      OR YOU MAY STICK WITH YOUR OLD S2 BY SAVING MONEY. COZ YOUR GONNA GET ALL THOSE FEATURES WHICH ARE ON S3 AFTER UPGRADING TO JELLYBEAN.
      
      BUT REALLY S2 IS JUST AWESOME PHONE."
Galaxy S3,3,I WAS JUST GOING THROUGH FEW VIDEOS OF DROP-TEST OF SGS3. THE RESULTS ARE PATHETIC. JUST ONE DROP AND IT'S GONE. THEY ARE SAYING THAT THE SCREEN IS PROTECTED BY GORILLA GLASS. BUT I REALLY DOUBT IT AFTER WATCHING THOSE VIDEOS. I ALMOST DECIDED TO BUY IT BUT THOSE TESTS MADE ME TO THINK AGAIN. JUST GO TO YOUTUBE.COM AND CHECK THE GALAXY S3 DROP TEST VIDEOS BEFORE YOU BUY.
Galaxy S3,3,"ITS AVERY NICE PHONE IT HAS HD SCREEN(720P) BUT IT AIN'T THE BEST,FOR INSTANCE IN RESOLUTION XPERIA S IS THE BEST WITH 342 PIXELS PER INCH(PPI) WHEREAS GLAXY S3 HAS ONLY 306 PPI DISPLAY,IN PROCESSOR INTEL XOLO X900 IS BEST WITH INTEL ATOM PROCESSOR 1.6GHZ  QUAD CORE &AMP; HTC ONE X IS ALSO BETTER IN PROCESSOR AND BUDGET &AMP; IT HAS 1.5GHZ QUAD PROCESSOR,IN MUSIC EVERYONE KNOWS HTC'S ONE X IS BEST WITH BEATS AUDIO,IN CAMERA 1(RESOLUTION) XPERIA S IS BEST WITH 12.1 MP CAMERA 2(SHUTTER TIME) XOLO X900 IS BEST WITH 10 PICTURES A SEC.INBURST MODE.IWILL PREFER HTC ONE X,XPERIA S AND INTEL'S XOLO X900 OVER GALAXY S3"
Galaxy S3,3,"ONE GROUP BOUGHT IT AND ARE SAYING NOTHING IS WRONG..OTHER GROUP BOUGHT A COMPETITOR LIKE 'ONE X' OR 'XPERIA S' AND THINKS ALMOST EVERYTHING IN S3 IS A CON..
      
      
      SINCE I PLAYED WITH ALL AND BOUGHT NONE OF THEM :P,I CAN ATLEAST HELP U WITH THE SCREEN TYPES..
      
      
      SCREEN: SUPER AMOLED HAS A WONDERFUL CONTRAST RATIO, GAME/VIDEOS/PICTURES/TEXTURES LOOK AWESOME BUT BRAVIA ENGINE HAS A MUCH BETTER REAL LIFE COLOR QUALITY NO OVER-SATURATION..
      
      
      IT DEPENDS ON YOU WHAT U WANT SUPER-CONTRASTED OR REAL-LIFE WALLPAPERS. I PERSONALLY DID NOT LIKE S-LCD IT LOOKS LIKE LCD JUST A BIT BRIGHTER !!!
      
      
      IPHONE 4/4S SCREEN IS ALSO GOOD ESPECIALLY WHILE PLAYING IOS HD GAMES. ITS SOOOO SMOOTH AND SOOTHING TO EYES, CANT DESCRIBE HAVE TO SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES TO GET THE FEEL."
Galaxy S3,3,"OVER PRICED!

      GRAPHICS HAVE NOT BEEN IMPROVED, SAME OLD MALI-400MP AS THAT OF GALAXY S2. BUT QUAD CORE MAKES ITS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS.
      
      
      8. OTHER FEATURES
      
      
      HOWEVER SAMSUNG HAS ALWAYS AMAZED ITS CUSTOMERS BY SETTING NEW BENCHMARKS IN MOBILE WORLD. ANDROID ICE-CREAM SANDWICH IS ICING ON THE CAKE. S VIEW AND S STAY THOUGH NEW FEATURES BUT ARE LITTLE UNREAL IN THE FAST WORLD WHERE WE CANT WAIT AND PRESS FOR LONG, SPEAK TO MIKE, WAIT FOR SYSTEM RESPONSE AND THEN AFFIRM. PHEW ! A BIT LENGTHY PROCESS, I WOULD RATHER TOUCH THE APP ICON.
      
      
      9. FINAL WORDS AND LOGICAL PREDICTIONS.
      
      
      S3 IS SO FAR BEST IN HARDWARE BUT ALL ITS EXPENSIVE FEATURES ARE NOT MUCH USABLE IN MARKET LIKE INDIA FOR EXAMPLE THEIR IS HARDLY ANY APP THAT CAN USE ALL THE FOUR QUADS OF ITS PROCESSOR. BUT YES THIS IS A FUTURE PROOF HANDSET AT OVERPRICED TAG. PRICES ARE BOUND TO FALL IN COMING MONTHS BECAUSE:
      
      1. FESTIVAL SEASON IS COMING
      
      2. INDIAN RUPEE IS WEAKEST AT THE MOMENT
      
      3. HYPE OF GALAXY S3 HAS INFLATED ITS INITIAL PRICE
      
      
      ITS PASSIONATE TO BUY THIS PHONE BUT NOT WISE."
Galaxy S3,3,"RECENTLY I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPCART AND LET ME SAY THEY HAVE VERY FANTASTIC LOGISTICS SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR THEIR HIGH VALUE DELIVERIES.
      
      BUT THIS PHONE HAVING RS 30000 TAG TO IT CERTAINLY NOT WORTH EVERY PENNY. IF YOU ARE USING THIS PHONE FOR CONTINUOUS 15 TO 20 MINS THEN IT HEATS UP QUITE BADLY.ALSO BATTERY DISCHARGING IS AT FAST PACE (I HAVE ENABLED 2G MODE AS BATTERY DISCHARGE RATE IS MORE ON 3G) IN THIS PHONE.I MAY BE NOTICING THIS FACT CAUSE TILL NOW I WAS OWNING A BLACKBERRY PHONE. WELL THIS PHONE IS AWESOME WHEN COMES TO PERFORMANCE AND COLORS ALONG WITH EASE OF USE JUST FANTASTIC.
      
      GLAD I HAVE UPGRADED TO S3 BUT THESE SAMSUNG PEOPLE COULD HAVE MADE THIS PHONE BETTER IF THEY HAVE ADDRESSED THE ISSUES I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED ABOVE.
      
      FINAL VERDICT:- PHONE IS GOOD."
Galaxy S3,3,"S3 IS A GOOD PHONE BUT THE TOUCHWIZ UI LOOKS OUTDATED NOW. ANDROID ITSELF IS LOSING ITS CHARM. EVEN THOUGH IT BOASTS OF 600K APPS MOST OF THEM R BOGUS. NOTHING IS UNIQUE AND U CAN CHANGE THE LOOK OF UR PHONE TOTALLY.
      
      ABOUT THE PHONE ITSELF, THE SCREEN IS EXCELLENT AND THE CAMERA IS REALLY GOOD, BUT U WILL FIND THAT MANY TIMES THE PHONE LAGS. IF U CHECK THE IN-USE RAM(LONG PRESS HOME BUTTON) U WILL SEE THAT MORE THAN 50% OF 832MB IS IN USE BY UNWANTED BACKGROUND APPS.
      
      IN ALL THE PHONE IS EXCELLENT, AND AT THE CURRENT COST A BETTER BUY THAN THE S4. OTHERWISE TRY HTC OR A WINDOWS PHONE LIKE LUMIA 820 OR 920."
Galaxy S3,3,"S3 PEBBLE BLUE LOOKS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN MARBLE WHITE.BUT BATTERY STORAGE DID NOT ENOUGH MATCHED ENOUGH ME!STILL GOT 832 MB OF RAM WHICH IS GOT 700 MB FULL IN QUICKLY.
      
      SCREEN LOOKS NICE.PLAY 1080P VIDEOS .BUT SKIP SOME FRAMES .
      
      OVERALL NICE PRODUCT!"
Galaxy S3,3,"SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS COOL SMART PHONE..VERY NICE FEATURES, NO DOUBT IN THAT. I HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF CONTACTS THAT ARE SYNCED UP BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT CAN'T LOAD CONTACTS FAST, IT TAKES SOMETIME TO LOAD UP ALL THE CONTACTS.I THINK THIS IS  PERFORMANCE ISSUE.HOWEVER,BESIDES THAT  S3 IS A COOL SMART PHONE."
Galaxy S3,3,SAMSUNG HAS JUST DROPPED THE PRICE OF S3.I AM SURE WE ARE GOING TO FIND NOTE 2 IN OUR MARKET PRETTY SOON OTHERWISE WHY WOULD SAMSUNG SLASH THE PRICE OF REALLY GOOD PHONE.THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE ITS DESIGN AND PLASTIC BODY.DEAR SAMSUNG PLEASE SURPRISE EVERYONE WITH A GOOD DESIGN LIKE THE NOKIA LUMIAS.
Galaxy S3,3,"SERIOUSLY!! IN THE FIRST PLACE I JUST CANNOT UNDERSTAND, WHY SHALL ONE PAY CLOSE TO 39000 INR, JUST FOR ICS AND A QUADCORE 1.4 GHZ PROCESSOR.
      
      THERE ARE MANY BETTER OPTIONS OTHER THAN S3, LIKE HTC ONE X(1.5 GHZ), SAMSUNG'S VERY OWN GALX NOTE, HTC'S SENSATION WHICH IS ALSO GOIN TO RECEIVE AN ICS UPDT. FURTHERMORE, OTHER REVIEWS ARE ALSO NEGATIVE. CAMERA FEATURES ARE SAME OLD TRIED AND TESTED ONES. I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH HTC INCREDIBLE S, THAT HTC SENSE IS MUCH MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY THAN ITS COUNTERPARTS. SO THUMBS DOWN S3. AND SAMSUNG BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME."
Galaxy S3,3,"SINCE HTC ONE X AND SGIII ARE CURRENTLY THE BEST ANDROID PHONES IN THE MARKET HERE'S A SHORT COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO...IT MAY HELP U TO DECIDE FOR OR AGAINST ONE OF THESE PHONES.
      
      
      1. FORM
      
      I PERSONALLY LIKE THE POLYCARBONATE UNI-BODY DESIGN OF THE HTC ONE X..BOTH BROWN GRAY AND WHITE LOOK BRILLIANT AND DON'T FEEL CHEAP IN YOUR HAND....THE SGIII GIVES U A PLASTIC-LIKE FEEL....NOTHING PREMIUM ABOUT THE BODY OF THIS SAMSUNG.
      
      
      2. BATTERY
      
      ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR ANY USER...THE BATTERY LIFE OF BOTH PHONES IS AROUND 8-9 HOURS, WHICH INCLUDES MODERATE GAMING, MUTIMEDIA USAGE, INTERNET SURFING, CALLS AND SMSES. THE BATTERY OF THE HTC IS A BIT POOR BUT AFTER A FIRMWARE UPDATE IT PERFORMS REALLY WELL...HOWEVER, BATTERY OF THE ONE X DOES DRAIN QUITE FAST WITH HEAVY/ CONTINUOUS GAMING. SGIII HAS A BIGGER BATTERY OF 2100 LI-ION MAH BATTERY COMPARED TO A LI-PO, 1800 MAH ON THE HTC ONE X....BUT REMEMBER A BIGGER BATTERY DOESN?T MEAN A BETTER BATTERY LIFE...BATTERY LIFE DEPENDS ON THE ENERGY UR PHONE CONSUMES ON RUNNING DIFFERENT FEATURES.
      
      
      3. SCREEN
      
      ALMOST THE SAME SIZE...SUPER LCD 2 ON THE ONE X AND HD SUPER AMOLED ON THE SGIII. WELL, IF U AREN'T A GEEK....BOTH SCREENS ARE AWESOME AND VIEWING ANGLES ARE BRILLIANT AND IF YOU ARE A GEEK THEN YOU DO KNOW THAT BOTH SCREENS HAVE SOME ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES.
      
      4. USER INTERFACE
      
      THE HTC SENSE IS MUCH BETTER THAN TOUCHWIZ....BUT THEN U CAN GET USED TO ANY OF THE TWO WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS.
      
      
      5. PROCESSOR
      
      SINCE THE SPECS ARE GIVEN ABOVE....IT'S ENOUGH TO SAY BOTH PHONES WILL RUN MULTIPLE APPS SUPER SMOOOTHLY. HERE I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT QUAD CORE PROCESSORS ARE CERTAINLY VERY FUTURISTIC BUT AS OF NOW...THERE'S ALMOST NO GAME/APP THAT A DUAL CORE WILL NOT RUN...BENCHMARKS APART, FOR THE GENERAL USER BOTH PROCESSOR CAN HANDLE ALMOST ANYTHING THAT U THROW AT THEM.
      
      
      6. CAMERA
      
      I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THE ONE X HAS A BETTER 8 MP CAMERA...PICS TAKEN FROM THE SAMSUNG APPEAR A BIT WARM..YET BOTH CAMERA'S ARE AWESOME...THE FRONT CAMERA'S ALSO DON?T DIFFER TOO MUCH IN TERMS OF THEIR QUALITY...AND U WILL ANYWAY USE THESE AS A MIRROR OR FOR VIDEO CHAT....
      
      
      7. MEMORY
      
      BOTH PHONES HAVE 1 GB RAM. THE INTERNAL STORAGE ON THE HTC ONE X IS AROUND 26 GB AND IT HAS NO MEMORY CARD SLOT. THE 16 GB GSIII HAS A MEMORY CARD SLOT AND ONE CAN USE AN SD CARD OF UP TO 64 GB.
      
      
      VERDICT: MAKE UR OWN CHOICE?.BUT PERSONALLY I WOULD PREFER THE HTC FOR THE NOVELTY FACTOR AND FOR BEING A VALUE FOR MONEY PHONE. THE ONE X?S NON-REMOVABLE BATTERY MAY BE A CONCERN FOR SOME BUT FRANKLY HOW MANY TIMES DO WE ACTUALLY REMOVE BATTERIES AND REPLACE THEM WITH SPARE ONES? ALSO, 26 GB ON PHONE AND 26 GB ON DROPBOX FOR TWO YEARS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH STORAGE?GSIII AT RS. 43, 180 (MARKET PRICE) IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND HAS A HOST OF NOT-SO-GREAT FEATURES. THE S VOICE IS APPLE?S EQUIVALENT OF SIRI AND IS EVEN WORSE (CALL IT A MARKETING GIMMICK) AND BY THE WAY HOW LONG WILL U TALK TO UR PHONE ANYWAY? THE SMART STAY FEATURE THAT KEEPS THE PHONE AWAKE AS LONG AS U LOOK AT IT MAY BE GOOD ON PAPER BUT MOST OF US WILL USE OUR FINGERS TO SCROLL THE SCREEN (WHICH IN TURN KEEPS THE SCREEN AWAKE)?.ALSO IT EATS UP A LOTTA BATTERY LIFE. IF YOU?RE BUYING A SMARTPHONE FOR THE FIRST TIME OR WANT TO UPGRADE TO A QUAD-CORE SUPERPHONE?GO FOR THE HTC ONE X?.YOU?LL LOVE THIS BEAST."
Galaxy S3,3,THE PHONE IS GREAT AT PERFORMANCE BT ITS PRICE IS OVREPRICED 39K. THE SCREEN IS NOT GOOD AMOLED IS GENERALLY OVERSATURATED.... HD IPS SCREEN ARE THE BEST (LG OPTIMUS 4X) TRUE NATURAL COLOUR... THE GPRS SUCKS CLASS 16 IN WHICH GENERATION IS SAMSUNG ....OPTIMUS 4X IS APURE COMPETION LET IT LAUNCH ....
Galaxy S3,3,"WELL IN TODAY'S GEN. SAMSUNG IS INVENTING MANY NEWMOBILES AND TABLETS LIKE THE ULTRA SLIM S2 , THE PHONTABLET GALAXY NOTE AND WELL THE MOST AWAITED GADGET WAS GALAXY S3 BUT WELL I THINK IT ISN'T THAT AMAZING NOW !
      
      
      THE GALAXY S3 HAS A 4.8 INCH SCREEN , A PLASTIC BODY WHICH THE SAMSUNG CLAIMS THAT MADE WITH NATURE .... HUH AND THE SAME 8MP CAMERA AND SO ON
      
      
      IF COMPARED WITH S2 ITS JUST A QUAD CORE CPU , A 0.5""BIGGER SCREEN , SOME FUNKY AND TRENDY FEATURES LIKE SMART STAY ,  SBEAM ETC... AND SOME CAMERA AJUSTMENTS AND THESE COST A 10K HIGHER THAT THE S2
      
      
      IF COMPARED WITH NOTE ITS ITS 0.5"" SMALLER , AND WELL DESIGN WISE I LIKE MY GALAXY NOTE VERY MUCH !
      
      
      IF COMPARED WITH ONE X ITS 0.1 GHZ LESS THAN IT , AND A 0.1 "" BIGGER AND ALSO HAS A MEMORY CARD !
      
      
      THE MAIN ADVANTAGES FOR THE SAMSUNG TO SEL THIS PRODUCT IS -
      
      1. THE BRAND NAME SAMSUNG S SERIES
      
      2. CAMERA ADJUSTMENTS
      
      3. A 64GIG MEMORY CARD SLOT
      
      4. FUNKY FEATURES LIKE NFC , SMART STAY , WIRELESS STREAMING
      
      
      BUT THE CONS ARE -
      
      1. NO 64GIG INTERNAL MODEL IN INDIA
      
      2. PLASTIC BODY
      
      3. ONLY 1GB RAM DISAPOINTING PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT FOR 2 GB
      
      4. ONLY 8MP CAMERA LIKE ITS OLDER ANCESTORS
      
      
      SO THOUGHT OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT BUT NOW FEELING HAPPY WITH MY ALAXY NOTE AND MY NEWLY BOUGHT ONE X"
Galaxy S3,3,"WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY A PHONE IN THE RANGE OF 30 - 45K CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS OTHER THAN S3 BEFORE GOING FOR S3
      
      
      - DROID RAZR MAXX - 31K
      
      - IPHONE 4S - 45K
      
      - SAMSUNG S2 - 28K
      
      
      MY FAVORITE IS IPHONE 4S. I RECENTLY PURCHASED ONE FOR 44.5K.
      
      YOU MAY SAY ITS QUITE EXPENSIVE WHICH I AGREE. HOWEVER LET ME TELL YOU WHENEVER I HOLD THE IPHONE IN MY HAND I FEEL I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION BY FORGOING 38K SAMSUNG S3. THE MAIN POINT IS PEOPLE IN INDIA HAVE SMALLER HANDS COMPARED TO THOSE IN WESTERN COUNTRIES AND YOU MAY FIND THAT S3 TOO BIG TO HOLD COMFORTABLY IN ONE HAND. THE IPHONE CAN BE USED WITH ONE HAND WHILE YOU ARE DRINKING TEA WITH ANOTHER."
Galaxy S3,2,"COMPARED TO MY EARLIER SMART PHONE OF OTHER BRAND, THIS IS HUGLY SUPERIOR TO HANDLE AND USE. HOWEVER I WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT WITHIN 5 DAYS OF PURCHASE THE DEVICE WOULD NOT GET CHARGED AND I HAD TO GIVE IT TO SAMSUNG SERTVICE CENTRE FOR REPAIRS CUSING A LOT OF INCONVENIENCE TO ME AS I HAD EXCHANGED MY REGULAR SIM CARD FOR MICRO ONE AND THAT WOULD NOT FIT INTO MY OLD DEVICE."
Galaxy S3,2,"EVERY THING IN THIS PHONE IS AWESOME BUT FOR THE FUTURE YOU CAN  NOT RELAY ON THIS PHONE NO 4G SUPPORT BETTER TO GO WITH HTC SENSATION 4G ANDROID PHONE,MOTOROLA - DROID RAZR MAXX 4G,HTC - INSPIRE 4G,SAMSUNG GALAXY NEXUS 4G(BUT NOT AVAILABLE IN INDIA YET)
      
      OR THE LAST I PHONE 4G OR 4S.CHOICE IS YOURS."
Galaxy S3,2,"HI GUYS..BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEWLY LAUNCHED AND MUCH HYPED SAMSUNG GALAXY S3..I HAVE TO SAY I REALLY HAVE MIX THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE PHONE. HAVING USED AND FACED A LOT OF SERIOUS ISSUES WITH SAMSUNG IN THE PAST, I AM REALLY NOT VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT RECOMMENDING THIS NEW GADGET FROM SAMSUNG TO MY FELLOW FLIPKART USERS.
      
      
      THE PHONE ALTHOUGH HAS SOME GOOD SPECS GOING FOR IT AND NOT TO FORGET THAT SAMSUNG IS RUNNING A FANTASTIC MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO SELL THE PHONE BUT GUYS DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SPEND OVER 35K ON A PHONE WHICH LOOKS WORST THAN A MICROMAX OR A KARBBON BRANDED PHONE. IT IS ALL DUE TO ITS CHEAP PLASTIC FINISH WHICH IS A BIG MINUS FOR A PHONE OF THIS PRICE RANGE. CLEARLY SAMSUNG BELIEVES ONLY IN SELLING ITS PRODUCTS AND MAKING PROFITS AND NOT GIVING A VALUE FOR MONEY/QUALITY PRODUCT LIKE APPLE, HTC (ONE-X) OR SONY (XPERIA-S...
      
      
      COMPARED TO SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 I PERSONALLY WILL ANY DAY GO FOR A I-PHONE 4S AT AN EXTRA PRICE OR IN FACT, WAIT FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED PHONE OF THE YEAR I-PHONE 5, WHICH I BELIEVE IS GOING TO TAKE THE MARKET BY STORM.
      
      
      GUYS...ALL THOSE WHO DON NOT WANT TO WAIT FOR THE I-PHONE 5 OR LG OPTIMUS 4X HD ETC. PLEASE AT LEAST KEEP IN MIND THAT AFTER YOU BUY THIS PHONE YOU WILL HAVE TO FACE THE HORRIBLE AFTER SALES SERVICE FROM SAMSUNG. THEY BELIEVE IN TORTURING THEIR CUSTOMERS AND UNLIKE APPLE, THEY DO NOT HAVE A FLEXIBLE REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE FOR THEIR FAULTY PRODUCTS (WHICH ARE MANY).
      
      
      BEWARE OF SAMSUNG GUYS, THEY ARE A VERY SMART BUNCH OF PEOPLE ,FOOLING INNOCENT CUSTOMERS WITH THEIR AGGRESSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS AND REALLY DON'T CARE ONCE THE SALE HAS BEEN MADE. GO FOR APPLE INSTEAD AS CLEARLY WITH ONLY ONE MODEL IN THE MARKET (IPHONE 4S) AGAINST SAMSUNG'S HUGE LINEUP OF CRAPPY, CHEAP PLASTIC LOOK PHONES, THEY ARE STILL THE WORLD'S NO#1 AND MOST VALUABLE SMART PHONE MANUFACTURERS.
      
      
      JUST FOR THE SPECS AND SOME NEW EXCITING FEATURES I AM GIVING IT A 2/5.
      
      
      MY VERDICT: WAIT FOR THE BIG DADDY OF THEM ALL I-PHONE 5
      
      
      CHEERS!!
      
      
      BHUWAN ;)"
Galaxy S3,2,I BOUGHT SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IN 39K IN JULY 2012 IMMEDIATE AFTER THE LAUNCH OF THE PHONE. HARDLY IT WORKED FOR 7 MONTHS AND ITS DEAD NOW AND NEED A TRANSPLANT I MEAN THE MOTHERBOARD NEED TO BE REPLACED ACCORDING TO AUTHORIZE SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE IN VARANASI. I WROTE EMAIL TO CEO'S OFFICE AND HAD FEW TELEPHONIC TALK TO THE OFFICE REPRESENTATIVE REGARDING REPLACEMENT OF WHOLE PHONE RATHER THAN JUST REPLACING THE MOTHERBOARD BUT THEY DID NOT AGREED TO DO SO. I WAS SHOCKED. ITS SO COSTLY CELL PHONE. I WOULD HAVE WAITED FOR IPHONE 5.DO I FILE A LEGAL NOTICE. KINDLY OPINE...
Galaxy S3,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER I USED S2 FOR ALMOST 11 MONTHS. I WAS VERY MUCH HAPPY WITH S2. THE HYPE OF S3 MADE ME BUY IT. NOW I AM REGRETTING IT. YOU ALL MUST BE AMAZED TO KNOW ITS THE MOST LAGGED PHONE I HAVE USED. S2 WAS FAR SUPERIOR TO IT. I WILL TELL YOU SOME FACTS WHICH SAMSUNG WILL NEVER. THEY JUST FOOL PEOPLE.
      
      FIRST AFTER YOU UPACK THE PHONE AND INSTALL 3-4 APPS AND START USING IT. YOU WILL SEE THAT IN JELLY BEANS UPDATE YOUR PHONE WILL BE RUNNING AT 700-750 MEMORY USAGE.ITS MAX USAGE IS 833MB. S2 WAS FAR SUPERIOR IN MEMORY MANAGEMENT. INCASE YOU START MULTITASKING AND OPEN 10-11 APPS PHONE WILL RESTART AS MEMORY WILL BE FULL. THEY SAY 1GB RAM BUT ACTAUL AVAILABLE IS 833MB. THIS PHONE IS DEAD IN MULTITASKING. IF YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME OR USING AN APP AND INCOMING CALL COMES BY THE TIME U PICK UP YOU WILL HAVE ATLEAST 7-10 SEC LAG. YOU WILL FEEL LIKE PHONE GETS HANGED.
      
      SECOND IMPORTANT THING IS YOU CAN TEST YOURSELF. THIS PHONE IS SO SLOW IN OPENING BASIC THINGS LIKE PHONE MANAGER,CONTACTS,EMAIL AND SMS.
      
      A TEST YOU CAN DO YOURSELF AND YOU WILL GET A SHOCK OF YOUR LIFE.
      
      IF YOU HAVE HTC ONE X OR S2 THEN PLEASE RESTART S3 AND S2. AFTER RESTARTING OPEN 2-3 APPS FOR MULTITASKING, THEN SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN PHONE MANAGER AT SAME TIME IN S2 AND S3. BINGO YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE. S3 WILL TAKE ALMOST 5-7 SEC TO OPEN A SIMPLE PHONE MANAGER WHILE S2 WILL DO IT IN LESS TIME. DO THIS TEST TO OPEN EMAIL,SMS AND CONTACTS.
      
      YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PHONE IS FRUSTRATING SLOW BECAUSE OF POOR MEMORY MANAGEMENT BY SAMSUNG AND ONLY 833MB RAM.
      
      SO MY ADVISE IT THIS PHONE IS ONLY GOOD IN TERMS OF MOVIES,CAMERA,PLAYING GAMES AS IT IS QUADCORE,MUSIC.
      
      BUT SIMPLE FEATURES LIKE CALLING SOMEONE BY SWIPING RIGHT,WRITING SMS,OPENING PHONE MANAGER,CONTACTS ,MULTITASKING THIS PHONE IS DISGUSTINGLY SLOW AND PATHETIC. I HATE THIS PHONE AND I WILL NEVER BUY SAMSUNG NEXT TIME UNLESS THEY PROVIDE FASTER MEMORY MANAGEMENT AND GOOD RAM. QUADCORE IS USELESS. NO USE AS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY APPS. WHILE SAMSUNG KNEW THIS MEMORY PROBLEM. THEY CLEVERLY PUT 2GB RAM IN US,EUROPE AND KOREA. IN ASIA THEY RELEASED SAME MODEL WITH 1GB RAM. GUYS ITS TIME TO SHOW SAMSUNG THAT INDIA IS NOT STUPID AND WE ARE NOT FOOLS."
Galaxy S3,2,"I USE MY PHONE FOR WORK AND NEED TO SEND A LOT OF EMAILS EVERYDAY. I SWITCHED FROM IPHONE 3GS TO THE S3 IN JAN. HERE IS MY FEEDBACK AFTER COMPARING WITH IPHONE 3GS, MICROMAX CANVAS HD.
      
      
      IPHONE 3GS: 800 MHZ, SINGLE CORE, 512 MB RAM, 8GB STORAGE.
      
      GALAXY S3: 1.4 GHZ, QUAD CORE, DEDICATED DUAL CORE GRAPHICS AND 1GB RAM.
      
      CANVAS HD: 1.2 GHZ, QUAD CORE, DEDICATED DUAL CORE GRAPHICS AND 1GB RAM
      
      
      MY COMPARISON OF THESE 3 PHONES BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPEIENCE OVER MONTHS IS AS FOLLOWS. . .
      
      
      1. SCREEN QUALITY:
      
      THE S3 HAS SLIGHTLY BETTER VISIBILITY IN SUNLIGHT. HOWEVER, SAMSUNG'S AMOLED NEEDS A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT. I HAVE CONFIRMED THAT MAGENTA, CYAN ETC COLORS ARE DISPLAYED INCORRECTLY VS COMPARING IT TO MY LAPTOP'S PHOTOSHOP CALIBERATED HD SCREEN. IT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE GREEN IS MIXED WITH ALL COLORS.
      
      CANVAS HD SCREEN IS VERY POOR IN COMPARISON AND LOOKS TERRIBLE WITH VERY LOW PIXEL DENSITY.
      
      THE 3GS HAS A SCREEN IN BETWEEN BOTH OF THESE. JUST FOR COMPARISON, THE IPHONE 4S IS ALMOST THE SAME PRICE, BUT HAS A MUCH BETTER SCREEN WITH GREATER PIXEL DENSITY THAN THE S3.
      
      
      2. CALL QUALITY: I AM REALLY FED UP OF PEOPLE TELLING ME TO CALL THEM BACK WHEN I HAVE A BETTER SIGNAL. EVERYONE TELLS ME THAT THERE IS AN ECHOING NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND.
      
      CANVAS HD OR IPHONE 3GS DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM.
      
      3. PHONE BECOMES HOT DURING CALLS. THE TOP RIGHT SIDE WHERE SAMSUNG USES A POWERFUL IR LED WITH THE PROXIMITY SENSOR. IT BURNS MY EARS AFTER 5 MINS.
      
      CANVAS HD OR IPHONE 3GS DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM.
      
      4. EXTREME LATENCY / LAG IN ALMOST ALL APPLICATIONS: FOR EG, IF YOU LAUNCH THE PHONE APP, IT TAKES 3 SECONDS TO LAUNCH. EMAIL APP ALSO TAKES 3-4 SECONDS TO LAUNCH. IN CONTRAST, MY 3 YEARS OLD IPHONE 3GS USED TO TAKE 1/4TH OF A SECOND TO LAUNCH BASIC APPS. IN SPITE OF BEING 4 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN THE 3GS, IT IS STILL SLOWER.
      
      INTRESTINGLY, THE CANVAS HD DOES NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM EITHER AND LAUNCHES BASIC APPS WITHIN HALF A SECOND.
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED IF YOU KEEP 2-3 APPS OPEN IN THE BACKGROUND TO AVOID THIS LAG.
      
      5. SAMSUNG BLOATWARE: MY PHONE NEEDED 2 RECHARGES DAILY UNTIL I ROOTED IT, AND REMOVED ALL SAMSUNG BLOATWARE USING TITANIUM. I HAVE DISABLED NFC, SAMSUNG KEYBOARD, ALLSHARE, ETC AND NOW MY BATTERY LIFE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED.
      
      FLIPKART POLICY DOES NOT PEMIT ME TO POST THE LINK TO XDA. PLEASE GOOGLE. :)
      
      CANVAS HD OR IPHONE 3GS DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM.
      
      6. WIFI SIGNAL: THIS PHONE KEEPS DROPPING AND RECONNECTING TO WIFI. LIKE ONCE EVERY 2 MINS WHILE WATCHING A MOVIE ON YOUTUBE. THE ANTENNA IS ON THE TOP LEFT SIDE, SO IF YOU KEEP YOUR HAND THERE, SIGNAL DROPS FROM 5 BARS TO 3 BARS.
      
      THE IPHONE 3GS HAD THIS PROBLEM BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT.
      
      THE CANVAS HD DOES NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM
      
      7. CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT IT IS PROBABLY 5MP TRUE AND NOT 8. COMPARED TO MY FRIEND'S 7 MP SONY CYBER SHOT CAMERA, THE PICS HERE ARE SOMEWHAT GRAINY AND OFF COLORED.
      
      THE 3GS AND CANVAS HD BOTH HAVE VERY POOR QUALITY CAMERAS NOT WORTH TALKING ABOUT.
      
      8. RANDOM RESTARTS WHILE BROWSING, MAKING CALLS, SMS, EMAILS, ETC. NOT SURE WHY, FACTORY RESET DID NOT HELP.
      
      WARRANTY:
      
      SAMSUNG: THE EXPERIENCE IN THE SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER WAS RATHER POOR. THE ENGINEERS STRAIGHT AWAY TALK ABOUT FACTORY RESET AND MOTHERBOARD CHANGE. THEY HAVE NO OTHER SOLUTIONS AND ARE RATHER RUDE.
      
      MICROMAX: SIMILAR TO SAMSUNG. LONG WAIT TIMES TOO.
      
      IPHONE 3GS: MY 3GS WAS REPLACED TWICE, FREE OF COST DUE TO MY OWN FAULT. APPLE DOES NOT REPAIR, BUT REPLACES THE PRODUCT WITH A REFURBISHED PIECE. ONCE, I DROPPED THE PHONE AND THE VOLUME BUTTON FELL OUT. ANOTHER TIME, THE BACK COVER BROKE DUE TO A FALL. BOTH TIMES, APPLE REPLACED IT WITH A SMILE.
      
      
      CONCLUSION: THE S3 IS A TIMEPASS PHONE, GOOD FOR MOVIES AND GAMES. NOT DEPENDABLE FOR EMAILS, OFFICE WORK.
      
      MICROMAX HD = SAMSUNG S3 WITH POOR SCREEN AND CAMERA MINUS LAG. 1/3RD THE PRICE. VALUE FOR MONEY.
      
      IPHONE 3GS: NO LONGER AVAILABLE."
Galaxy S3,2,"I WOULD NOT GO INTO SPECIFICATIONS OF THIS PHONE, MULTIPLE OTHER AREAS AND SECTIONS CLEARLY LIST THEM DOWN FOR YOU. A QUICK BRIEF ON ME, I AM A TECHNOLOGY LOVER AND OWN MULTIPLE DEVICES.
      
      
      THE S3 IS A GOOD PHONE WITH DECENT FEATURES. MY REVIEW OF THIS PHONE IS NOT POSITIVE. FOR THE GIVEN FEATURES ANY PHONE IN THE 20K RANGE WOULD PROVIDE YOU 99% IF NOT ALL FEATURES. TODAY ALL PHONES OFFER DECENT CAMERAS, E-MAIL, VIDEO CALLING, MESSAGING PLATFORMS, APPLICATIONS / GAMING. SO THE QUESTION IS REALLY WHY ARE WE BUYING THIS PHONE. IS THAT ONE OR TWO FEATURE WORTH YOUR ADDITIONAL 16-18K ???
      
      
      IF YOU ARE A SAMSUNG LOVER - BUY IT! ELSE THERE IS NO REASON TO SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR YOUR MONEY'S WORTH."
Galaxy S3,2,"IF YOU ARE GOING FOR THIS PHONE ONLY FOR OFFICE USE THEN IT IS A WRONG PHONE.
      
      A SIMPLE EXAMPLE IS THAT WHEN U TRY TO OPEN A PDF OF 35MB APPROX SIZE AND TRY TO OPEN FOR READING, THE PHONE WILL BE DAM SLOW AND YOU HAVE TO WAITE FOR ALMOST 1 MIN  TO SCROLL EACH PAGE AND READ."
Galaxy S3,2,"S3 IS A GREAT STEP AHEAD IN INNOVATION AND DESIGN AND IT IS GOOD TO ALWAYS INNOVATE. BUT I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS DESIGNED FOR HUMANS, AS EVERY OTHER PHONE IS ALSO DESIGNED FOR HUMANS AND NOT FOR ANIMALS, THE SAME THING APPLIES EVEN FOR OTHER PRODUCTS OF SAMSUNG.
      
      
      THE PRICING IS INSANELY HIGH, ONE CAN GET A VERY GOOD LAPTOP WITH THE SAME PRICE, WITH INTEL CORE I3, 500GB HARD DISK, 4GB RAM AND 14 INCH HIGH RESOLUTION LED DISPLAY AND DO REMEMBER A PROCESSING POWER OF A LAPTOP CAN NEVER BE MATCHED BY A SMARTPHONE.
      
      1. THERE IS NO SECURITY ON A SMARTPHONE, MORE AND MORE HACKING ATTEMPTS ARE MADE ON ANDROID PHONES, SO CAN YOU DO ONLINE BANKING ON YOUR SMART PHONE?
      
      
      2. THE SCREEN SIZE OF 4.8 INCH IS NO MATCH TO 14 INCH DISPLAY ON A LAPTOP AND FRANKLY SPEAKING, HOW MUCH TIME ONE WOULD SPEND READING ON A SMARTPHONE SCREEN, WHATEVER IT IS(SAMOLED ETC)
      
      
      3. CAN YOU RUN SOFTWARE ON A SMARTPHONE, CAN YOU RUN MATLAB, CAN YOU RUN CAD, CAM. OR FOR SIMPLE MATTER, CAN YOU RUN C COMPILER. NO
      
      
      4. WHAT IS THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF A MOBILE, TO CALL, BUT THERE IS NO MENTION OF HOW THE CALL QUALITY IS OR HOW THE SIGNAL STRENGTH VARIES. ONE SHOULD NOT FORGET ABOUT THE CALL QUALITY.
      
      
      5. IF ONE FEELS A LAPTOP IS BULKY THAN A SMARTPHONE, THEN I WOULD SAY, HOLDING A 4.8 INCH SMARTPHONE IS ODD TO SAY THE LEAST.
      
      
      6. ALSO THE NFC FEATURE FOUND ON THIS IS FOUND ON NOKIA 603, WHICH IS PRICED AT RS 12860 AND IT HAS IPS-LCD SCREEN, WHICH IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN SAMOLED DISPLAYS.
      
      
      7. COMING TO APPS, APPS ARE IMPORTANT, BUT HOW MANY APPS ONE WOULD USE EVERYDAY AND HOW MANY APPS ARE REALLY SO USEFUL?
      
      CONCLUDING, KUDOS FOR SAMSUNG FOR A VERY GOOD SMARTPHONE, BUT THE PRICING IS INSANE. WHEN WORLD AROUND IS SUFFERING FROM A SEVERE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND EURO ZONE CRISIS AND INR AT ALL TIME LOW VIS-A-VIS WITH DOLLAR, IT IS TIME TO INTROSPECT, IF THE PRICING IS PRAGMATIC. IT GOES FOR ALL MOBILE PHONE MANUFACTURERS."
Galaxy S3,2,"S3 IS GOOD BUT NOT BEST, ACCORDING TO PHONE SPECIFICATIONS PRICE IS REALLY MUCH HIGHER. INSTEAD OF THIS I AM HAVING SONY XPERIA S AND GOT TO TELL EVERYONE THAT IT IS A WAY MUCH BETTER THAN S3 AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN S3. SAMSUNG LAUNCHED IT'S PHONE AT PRICE 39,000 WITH VERY DISAPPOINTING FEATURES. I DIDN'T MEAN THAN S3 IS BAD BUT IT WAS DISAPPOINTMENT. BECAUSE IF YOU ARE GETTING XPERIA S WITH PRICE 30,000 AND HAVING MUCH HIGHER FEATURES THAN SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 THAN WHY ANYONE WOULD BUY A PHONE WHOSE PRICE IS MUCH HIGHER THAN IT'S FEATURES."
Galaxy S3,2,"S3 IS HAVING A CORD CORE PROCESSOR BUT STILL IT WORKS LIKE DUAL CORE ..DISPLAY IS GOOD .PLAYING GAMES IS QUIET A TASK (HANGING ISSUES) ,NO FLASH SUPPORT FOR JELLY BEAN SO I WOULD RECOMMEND TO BUY A IPHONE 4S OR HTC ONEX..HOWEVER S3 IS HAVING PREETY GOOD INTERFACE BUT PROCESSOR IS NOT AS SUPPORTIVE ..AND IF YOU HAD PREVIOUSLY USED ANY MODEL OF IPHONES YOU WOULD DEFINATELY NOT LIKE IT ..."
Galaxy S3,2,SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS AWESOME ESPECIALLY WITH A JBL JEMBE BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS  NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE AT JBL SITE... FRIENDS IF U LOVE MUSIC AND WANT PERFECT PAIR OF 2.1 SPEAKERS FOR UR SAMSUNG GET THIS PIECE NOW.......
Galaxy S3,2,"THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT US, INDIANS! AFTER MAKING YOU THE KING OF THE HILL!! LOL LOOKS LIKE YOU THINK US TO BE FOOLS, LAUNCHING WATERED DOWN VERSIONS OF YOUR 'HIGHEST END' PRODUCTS HERE!
      
      SAD SAMSUNG SAD!
      
      WE AREN'T FOOLS &AMP; IF YOU SHORTCHANGE US, WE WILL KICK YOU IN THE BUTT, JUST LIKE WE DID WITH NOKIA!"
Galaxy S3,2,THIS PHONE A TRUE COMPETITOR OF IPHONE 4S (DONT KNOW OF 5)IS TERRIBLY LACKING IN STYLE. LOOK AT ITS SIZE ITS TOO LONG AND FEELS MORE LIKE A TAB THAN PHONE.NOW WITH NOKIA LUMIA 920 AND IPHONE 5 COMMING TO THE MARKET (BOTH HAS SPECS BETTER THAN S111) I SUGGEST PEOPLE TO WAIT BEFORE BUYING THIS GIANT.FOR THOSE WHO CANT LOOK AT EXISTING ONES FROM HTC LIKE ONE X AND LUMIA 900.
Galaxy S3,1,"BETTER ALTERNATIVES : -
      
      1. HTC ONE X - BEST IN CLASS CAMERA, BUILD QUALITY, DISPLAY &AMP; USER INTERFACE..
      
      2. SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE - BETTER BATTERY LIFE, ITS A PHABLET!!
      
      3. MOTOROLA DROID RAZR - VALUE FOR MONEY, BEST IN CLASS BUILD QUALITY &AMP; INTUTIVE USER  INTERFACE.."
Galaxy S3,1,"BOUGHT THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S III FROM SAMSUNG AUTHORISED STORE JUST OPPOSITE MAURYA LOK, PATNA. WITHIN 4 DAYS IT STOPPED CHARGING, WHEN APPROACHED THE STORE, THEY ASKED ME TO CONTACT THE SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE IN ASHIANA, EXHIBITION ROAD, PATNA.
      
      I DID REMIND THEM BY SHOWING THEM THE BILL THAT ITS JUST 4 DAYS THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IT AND IS DOWN AND SHOULD BE REPLACED BUT THEY SAID THAT ITS YOUR BAD LUCK AND AS PER WARRANTY TERMS I SHOULD CONTACT SERVICE CENTRE.
      
      SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE TOOK IT ON 17-10-2012 AND ASKED TO CONTACT THE OTHER DAY AND NEXT DAY THEY SAID THAT IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN A WEEK AS THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THE MOTHERBOARD. I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO CONTACT AFTER 27-10-2012.
      
      I AM JUST CROSSING MY FINGER THAT MY INVESTMENT OF RS.35000 IS NOT FUTILE BUT YES FOR SURE I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY SAMSUNG MOBILE ANYMORE."
Galaxy S3,1,"DEAR CUSTOMERS,
      
      
      I WILL BE DIVIDING MY REVIEW INTO TWO PARTS. FIRST PART ABOUT THE PHONE AND THE SECOND PART ON FLIPKART SERVICE.
      
      
      SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 (32GB) REVIEW:
      
      
      PROS: THE BEST PART OF THIS PHONE IS ITS AMOLED DISPLAY[MADE MY SAMSUNG] AND THE ANDROID OS[MADE BY GOOGLE].
      
      CONS: IN TERMS OF HARDWARE THIS FEELS LIKE A PLASTIC TOY AND VERY FILMSY.
      
      MY PHONE STOPPED WORKING ON 25TH DAY FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY. IT SEEMS THERE IS PROBLEM WITH THE USB CHARGING PORT. THIS IS NOT EXPECTED FROM A PHONE WORTH 35K.
      
      
      FLIPKART SERVICE REVIEW:
      
      TILL NOW THERE SERVICE HAS BEEN VERY PROMPT AND PACKAGING IS EXCELLENT. RECEIVED THE PRODUCT IN BRAND NEW CONDITION WITHOUT ANY TAMPERING WITH THE PACKAGE.
      
      HAVE ASKED FOR AN REPLACEMENT UNDER 30 DAYS REPLACEMENT POLICY AND YET TO SEE HOW RESPOND TO THAT."
Galaxy S3,1,FIRST OF ALL I DON'T EVEN THINK BUYING SAMSUNG MOBILES AS THEY SUCKS BIG TIME. BUT SAW THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC CRAP IN ONE OF MY COLLEAGUE'S HAND AND YAK IS THE FIRST WORD COME INTO MY MIND. AND ALL THOSE GUYS WHO COMPARING IT WITH APPLE (IPHONE) THEN THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY WRONG WITH YOU AND YOU NEED IMMEDIATE MEDICATION. APPLE IS WAY WAY ABOVE LEVEL OF SAMSUNG OR ANY OTHER MOBILE BRAND. SO YOU GUYS ARE OUT OF IPHONE LEAGUE AND DON'T EVEN THINK TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND STAY HAPPY WITH YOUR PLASTIC CRAP OH I MEAN GALAXY S3......
Galaxy S3,1,FIRST OF ALL THE PHONE IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY NO GOOD BATTERY BACK UP AND THE SCREEN IS WORST I CAN SEE PIXELS AN STUFF THE GAMES DON'T RUN PROPERLY AND I STILL DINT GET MY ICS UPDATE SAMSUNG HAS DONE A VERY BAD JOB WITH TOUCHWIZ  AND PRODUCT IS JUST A WASTE THERES NO CARD SLOT TH RAM IS ONLY 512 MB AND THERES NO 3G TH CAMERA IS ALSO NOT GOOD VERY BAD SAMSUNG BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME...
Galaxy S3,1,"FOLKS LETS GET THINGS STRAIGHT . THIS PHONE IS OUTTA BUDGET FOR MANY PEOPLE. MAKE A STATISTICS OUT OF 100, 20 MIGHT HAVE THIS PURCHASING POWER . I APPRECIATE IT'S FEATURES. BUT STILL ITS MARKET ITS UNDER-PREDICTIVE IN  INDIAN MARKET. I BET MAXIMUM WOULD JUST READY THE FEATURES AND GO OUT .
      
      
      SO OVERALL THE BUDGET IS THE MAIN CONSTRAINT WHILE BUYING THIS GADGET. OTHERWISE THINGS ARE ALL PERFECT IN THIS . I WOULD PREFER HAVING AN IPAD OR SOMETHING ELSE RATHER BUYING THIS GIG."
Galaxy S3,1,GO FOR THE WINDOWS PHONES. YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!
Galaxy S3,1,"HELP INDIA - PLEASE READERS COPY PASTE THIS ON EVERY FORUM - THIS IS A ISSUE WITH ALL SAMSUNG AMOLED PRODUCTS, DO NOT BUY ANY SAMSUNG EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS, HUGE QUALITY FLAW IN SAMSUNG S3, PLEASE DO NOT WASTE MONEY BUYING A 40,000 PHONE, BUY HTC ONE X OR ONE S OR NOKIA OR LG 4X WHICH ARE BETTER. IT'S A FLAW IN EVERY PIECE OF SAMSUNG S3 WHICH I HAVE SEEN. MAYBE 10 TO 12 PHONES WHICH I HAVE SEEN HAS THIS HUGE BLUNDER. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT A SAMSUNG S3 GET THE DOA (REPLACE THE PIECE). FLAW CLUE: COMPARE YOUR SAMSUNG S3 WITH OTHER SAMSUNG S3 (THEY WILL BE DIFFERENT) YELLOWNESS (FADE DIRTY COLORS) - BLACK GRADIENT BANDING (THE COLOR SHOULD BE BLACK, NOT BANDING), SAMSUNG GALLERY Y OR GALAXY FIT, OPEN THE BROWSER GOOGLE HOME PAGE, CHECK THE CONTRAST/BRIGHTNESS...WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK IS BETTER? DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG PRODUCTS THEY ARE CHEATING THE INDIANS BY PUTTING A FAKE QUALITY PRODUCT AND SELLING FOR 40 THOUSAND, SHAME ON SAMSUNG. COMPARE THE SCREEN WITH LG 4X OR EVEN WITH LG 2X OR ANY CHEAPER PHONE. THESE COULD BE ON ALL PRODUCTS WHICH ARE EXPENSIVE AS THEY MAKE HUGE PROFITS BY USING CHEAP HARDWARE. ALL NEW AND UPCOMING PHONES COULD BE PLAGUED WITH SUCH BAD QUALITY WORTHLESS HARDWARE. STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG PRODUCTS"

Galaxy S3,1,"I BAOUGH THIS HANDSET FROM POORVIKA MOBILES AND IN THE SECOND CHARGING ITSELF, IT STOPPED CHARGING MORE THAN 10%.
      
      VERY BAD PERFORMANCE AND I WILL NEVER ALLOW ANY OF MY KNOWN PERSONS TO BUY THIS PHONE.  SAMSUNG...S3....380000RUPEES....WASTE OF MONEY.....THOMAS"
Galaxy S3,1,"I DONT KNOW GUYS,THAT TILL NOW YOU HAVE FACED ANY CHARGING PROBLEM OR NOT..I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 12 TH FEB FROM LOCAL STORE AND AFTER RETURNING HOME,WHEN I TRIED TO CHARGE MY MOBILE,IT DIDN'T SUPPORT THE CHARGER.I WENT TO THE STORE AND THEY FINALLY REPLACED MY MOBILE AFTER 7 DAYS..NOW,MY NEW S3 HAS ALSO THE SAME CHARGING PROBLEM.FINALLY IT IS IN SERVICE CENTER.CAN YOU GUYZ  TELL ME THAT YOU ARE ALSO FACING SAME PROBLEM OR NOT ?"
Galaxy S3,1,"I DON'T LIKE THIS PHONE AT ALL IT HANGS A LOT AND ANDROID IS VERY VIRUS PRONE .
      
      I SOLD MY S3 FOR 15000 AFTER USING A MONTH.
      
      I AM SATISFIED WITH NOKIA LUMIA 920 A LOT . IN LUMIA I MISS FEW GAMES BUT IT NEVER HANGED AND VERY SMOOTH. WITH LESS HARD WARE CONFIG IT WORKS MUCH BETTER THAN S3 ."
Galaxy S3,1,I GOT THIS PHONE 2 MONTHS BACK FROM SINGAPORE SINCE IT WAS CHEAPER THERE.. YESTERDAY I DROPPED IT ACCIDENTALLY WHILE GETTING OUT FROM MY CAR. AS SOON THE PHONE HIT THE ROAD IT BROKE INTO 3 PIECES..I MEAN THE SCREEN ALONG WITH UNIT CAME OUT OF THE PANEL/BODY AS THE EDGES WERE BROKEN AND CRACKED. I GOT ME REALLY PISSED. NEVER GOING BACK TO SAMSUNG AGAIN. HTC AND NOKIA ARE BETTER CHOICES AS FAR THE BUILD QUALITY IS CONCERNED.
Galaxy S3,1,I HAVE PURCHASED A SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 FOR 29500 AND THE BATTERY IS DOWN RIGHT FROM DAY 1. I SOMETIMES HAVE A FEELING THAT THE PRODUCT IS OF INFERIOR QUALITY AND IT IS NOT ORIGINAL PRODUCT THAT WAS DELIVERED TO ME.
Galaxy S3,1,"I HAVE PURCHASED FROM SAMSUNG ESTORE (NOT FROM FLIPKART) SAMSUNG GALAXY SIII (PAID RS 26789/- VIA OFFER) AND I AM FACING PERFORMANCE ISSUES (LAGGING, RAM OVER SHOOTS AND SHUTDOWNS, BATTERY OVERHEATING, PRECLOSURE OF APPS)
      
      
      LATER I HAVE CONTACTED THE SAMSUNG CUSTOMER CARE AND ASKED A PROPER EXPLAINATION, BECAUSE HOW COME PERFORMANCE ISSUES WOULD BE THERE FOR A NEW MOBILE BOUGHT FROM SAMSUNG ESTORE. THEY ASKED ME TO VISIT THE CUSTOMER CARE AND THEY INSPECTED MY MOBILE AND TOLD THERE WOULD BE PROBLEM WITH THE MOTHER BOARD
      
      
      THE SAME PERFORMANCE ISSUES FOR MY COLLEAGE WHO PURCHASED SAMSUNG SIII FROM SAMSUNG ESTORE
      
      
      NOW I AM ASKING SAMSUNG FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF MY HANDSET BUT SAMSUNG SAYS ONLY A REPAIR(EVEN FLIPKART GIVES 30 DAYS REPLACEMENT) WOULD BE POSSIBLE
      
      
      LATER FROM THE INTERNET I CAME TO NOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH MOTHER BOARDS FOR A PARTICULAR LOT OF MOBILES AND SAMSUNG IS TRYING TO SELL THESE MOBILES VIA OFFERS ......... BEWARE OF SAMSUNG CHEATING THE INDIAN CUSTOMERS
      
      
      MAKE A RIGHT DECISION BEFORE BUYING/INVESTING OVER THESE CHEAP PHONES
      
      
      PLANNING TO MOVE THIS ISSUE TO INDIAN CONSUMER COURT"
Galaxy S3,1,"I LIKE IT BUT I WILL TELL U TO GO FOR NOTE.ITS NOT WORTH IT.
      
      PLUS NOTE HAS MUCH BETTER FEATURES.
      
      
      
      
      I AM NOT A FANBOY BUT I OWN ALL!!!"
Galaxy S3,1,"I NEVER THOUGHT A HIGH END SMART PHONE WOULD PERFORM LIKE THIS..
      
      
      I WOULD GIVE YOU THE STORY
      
      FIRST 3 WEEKS -- AWESOME (NO OTHER PHONE IS LIKE THIS, BUYING IPHONE IS WASTE)
      
      2ND MONTH -- AVERAGE (I COULD HAVE BOUGHT IPHONE, BUT ITS OK THIS IS CHEAPER AND ANYWAY THIS IS A HIGH END SMART PHONE)
      
      3RD MONTH -- WORST (PHONE CONTACTS GOES MISSING, PHONE FREEZES, NOTIFICATION CENTER DOESNT WORK, NEED TO RESTART TO MAKE PHONE BETTER, BLA BLA BLA)(IPHONE IS BEST)
      
      4TH MONTH -- MY S3 ON OLX AND GETS A NEW IPHONE..
      
      
      THE END (HAPPY ENDING WITH IPHONE)"
Galaxy S3,1,"I PURCHASED AN S III ON 16TH AUGUST, THE PCB/MOTHERBOARD BECAME DEFECTIVE ON 24TH NOVEMBER. THE ENGINEER IN THE SERVICE CENTRE TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SPARE PCB AVAILABLE, THEY HAD TO ORDER IT, I WAITED FOR 5 DAYS. I WAS NOT PROVIDED A STANDBY PHONE NOR A SIM JACKET FOR MY MICRO-SIM. DISGUSTING! THE ENGINEERS MIGHT BE POLITE AND MY ISSUE WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, BUT VERY POOR SERVICE. I PURCHASED MY S III FOR 36K, SAMSUNG PLEASE TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS WELL. I'M NEVER BUYING A SAMSUNG AGAIN."
Galaxy S3,1,"I WAS WAITING FOR THE SGS3 SINCE LAST YEAR, BUT AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ISSUES ITS BUYERS HAVE BEEN FACING RECENTLY AS BELOW:
      
      
      1) DARK SCREEN
      
      2) CALL DROPS
      
      3) NO VOICE IN INCOMING CALLS FROM CALLERS
      
      4) POOR WIFI RECEPTION
      
      5) HEADPHONE DOESNT ENTER INTO THE SLOT
      
      6) BUBBLES IN THE SCREEN
      
      7) SCREEN BLEED
      
      8) YELLOW OR PINK TINT ON THE SCREEN ETC.
      
      
      I WOULD SINCERELY AND HONESTLY SUGGEST THAT YOU EITHER OPT FOR THE SGS2 (INSTEAD OF SGS3) OR WAIT FOR THE MOTOROLA RAZR MAXX (WHICH HAS JUST BEEN PUT UP ON FLIPKART)."
Galaxy S3,1,IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING S3 PLEASE THINK TWICE. I HAVE BEEN A SAMSUNG FAN FROM GALAXY DAYS AND THE FIRST ONE TO GET THE S3.EVERYTHING WERE COOL FOR 2 MONTHS AND THEN SUDDENLY SMALL LINEAR CRACKS STARTED APPEARING ON THE SIDE OF THE WHITE GALAXY S3.THE CRACKS APPEARS FROM NOWHERE SINCE THE PHONE HAS NOT BEEN DROPPED EVEN ONCE. TWO DAYS BACK THE PHONE BECAME DEAD WITHOUT ANY REASON. ONE MOMENT ITS CHARGING AND THE NEXT MOMENT ITS DEAD.THE SERVICE CENTER PEOPLE SAID THAT THE CHARGING BOARD NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND IT WILL TAKE A WEEKS TIME TO GET IT REPAIRED. SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 WHITE IS PLAGUED WITH PROBLEMS.THE CRACK PROBLEM IS A COMMON ONE AND YOU CAN GET INNUMERABLE INSTANCES OF THIS PROBLEM ACROSS GALAXY FORUMS AROUND THE WORLD. SAMSUNG IS TAKING ITS LOYAL CUSTOMERS FOR A RIDE. WE PAY THE HARD EARNED MONEY ON PREMIUM MOBILE DEVICES EXPECTING A SMOOTH TROUBLE FREE EXPERIENCE AND IN THE CASE OF SAMSUNG S3 THERE IS NO GUARANTEE ON WHAT THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE.IF YOU ARE LUCKY YOU MAY GET A TROUBLE FREE DEVICE OTHERWISE YOU WILL CURSE THE MOMENT YOU MADE THE DECISION TO PURCHASE S3.
Galaxy S3,1,"I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH BIG PHONE IN HAND.
      
      
      ITS HORRIBLE TO CARRY EASILY.
      
      
      U SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST A CAR TO CARRY THIS JUMBO.
      
      
      THOUGH I ACCEPT THAT
      
      
      THIS IS THE FASTEST AND SMARTEST MACHINE AVAILABLE ON EARTH.

      GO FOR APPLE.
      
      
      I PHONE5

      AND BELIEVE ME IT'S JUST PEACE OF SOUL TO HAVE A AVERAGE SCREEN PHONE IN PALM,
      
      
      WHICH FITS PROPERLY .
      
      
      RATHER THAN ""JUMBO""

      BEAUTY WITH BRAINS
      
      
      AND AFFORDABLE TOO."
Galaxy S3,1,"LET'S START WITH THE POSITIVES FIRST.
      
      1. THE SCREEN IS GOOD TO LOOK AT, NICE RESOLUTION, BUT IT'S A PENTILE DISPLAY I.E. NOT AS SHARP AS THE RESOLUTION SUGGESTS.
      
      2. LIGHT WEIGHT.
      
      4. SLIM.
      
      5. DECENT AUDIO OUTPUT.
      
      6. THAT'S IT.
      
      
      NOW THE CONS.
      
      1. AS I SAID EARLIER, THE SCREEN COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER, PENTILE SCREENS ARE CHEAP AND POOR TO LOOK AT.THE CONTRAST RATIO IS PATHETIC.
      
      2. VIRTUALLY UNREADABLE IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT.
      
      3. YES IT'S LIGHT WEIGHT, HENCE IT FEELS CHEAP, AND IS FRUSTRATINGLY DELICATE. I COULDN'T KEEP IT IN MY JEAN'S POCKET WITHOUT FEARING THAT IT WOULD BREAK APART. IT ACTUALLY MADE CRACKLING NOISES WHEN HELD IN LANDSCAPE WHILE TYPING A MESSAGE.
      
      4. LOOKS AWFUL. HONESTLY, S2 LOOKED WAY BETTER THAN THIS EYESORE OF A PHONE.
      
      5. LAGS, YES! LAGS!. A QUADCORE MIGHT SUGGEST FLUID PERFORMANCE. BUT IT DOESN'T DELIVER. THOUGH IT FEELS FASTER THAN THE S2, BUT THE PERFORMANCE IS WAY BELOW THE QUADCORE NORMS.
      
      6. I WAS SO EXCITED TO PLAY GTA III AND MAX PAYNE ON THIS, BUT SADLY FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASONS, NEITHER OF THEM WORK FLUIDLY. GTA III LAGS REALLY BADLY. AND MAX PAYNE CRASHES RANDOMLY. (RANDOM = A LOT)
      
      7. THE PHONE HEATS UP!. EVEN WHEN I LISTENED TO MUSIC, IT GOT HOT!.
      
      
      SOLD MY S3 AND BOUGHT AN 808 PUREVIEW. BEST MOVE.
      
      
      I'M OFF THE ANDROID BOAT NOW. WINDOWS PHONE SEEMED LIKE A BETTER OPTION, BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE LUMIA 800, AND AS THE LUMIA 900 WASN'T AVAILABLE I WENT FOR THE NOKIA 808 PUREVIEW INSTEAD AND I'M HAPPY! THE BEST CAMERA, BEST SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY. AND BEST AUDIO OUTPUT, DOLBY SURROUND BABY, YEAH!
      
      
      I'LL WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE S4 BRINGS TO THE TABLE. TILL THEN, BYE BYE ANDROID.
      
      
      SHOULD YOU BUY THIS? WELL, IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU USE IT. IF YOU JUST WANT A BIG SCREEN IN A PHONE, THEN GO BUY IT. BUT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, SKIP IT!"
Galaxy S3,1,"NO QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR FOR 38900 RUPEES. EVEN HTC ONE S IS AVAILABLE WITH QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4. BETTER GO FOR HTC ONE X THAN SAMSUNG GALAXY SIII. WASTAGE OF MONEY. ITS NOT FUTURE PROOF. SAMSUNG RELEASED THEIR GALAXY SIII WITH QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR CLOCKED AT 1.5GHZ IN LTE MODEL, BUT I DON?T THINK IT WILL RELEASE IN INDIA. SO BETTER GO FOR HTC ONE X THIS TIME."
Galaxy S3,1,OVER CONFIDENT SAMSUNG ASKING HIGHER PRICE..BAD PERFORMANCE...BUY LG OPTIMUS 4X HD MUCH BETTER THAN SIII IN ALL WORDS.STOP TRUSTING SAMSUNG..CHEATING PEOPLE...TRY 4X HD'S G FORCE TEGRA 3 GRAPHICS BETTER THAN SAMSUMSUNG'S MALI400MP..

Galaxy S3,1,"SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 HAS INTERNAL MEMORY OF 16GB(ACTUALLY APPROX 14GB AS SOME MEMORY IS USED BY SYSTEM)-ALL APPS N GAMES U DOWNLOAD WILL BE STORED IN INTERNAL MEMORY ONLY N U CANT TRANSFER APPS N GAMES TO AN EXTERNAL MICROSD. THERE IS NO OPTION FOR THAT ON PHONE. SO U R EFFECTIVELY LIMITED TO 16 GB FOR APPS AND GAMES. OTHER MEDIA N ENTERTAINMENT FILES U CAN EASILY STORE IN MICROSD, BUT SOMEONE BUYING THE MOST EXPENSIVE MOBILE PHONE ON THE MARKET, WOULD DEFINATELY LIKE MORE THAN 16 GB FOR THEIR APPS N GAMES. IF U DONT BELIEVE ME ASK SOMEONE WITH PHONE OR CHECKOUT ON INTERNET .HTC ONE X HAS 32GB INTERNAL STORAGE IS BETTER THAT WAY ALTHOUGH THERE U CANT  USE MICOSD IN THAT HTC :("
Galaxy S3,1,"SAMSUNG IS SLIPPING...
      
      SAMSUNG HAS DONE A BAD JOB WITH S3 THIS YEAR. THE DESIGN IS UNINSPIRING. SPECS WHICH WERE SAMSUNG'S USP HAVE ALSO BEEN DILUTED POSSIBLY DUE TO THE WEAK ANDROID COMPETITION ESP FROM HTC AND MOTOROLA. LG IS ALWAYS PLAGUED WITH SOFTWARE ISSUES AND CONFUSION. SO SAMSUNG FOLLOWED UP THE SPEC-BUSTING S2 WITH A RATHER UNDERWHELMING S3. MY SORE POINTS ARE AS BELOW:
      
      
      FIRSTLY SAD DESIGN...! SADDER COLORS...!
      
      1GB RAM VS 2GB RAM EXPECTED
      
      8MP CAMERA VS 12MP EXPECTED
      
      720P PENTILE DISPLAY VS SUPERAMOLED PLUS FULLHDDISPLAY
      
      AND UNAVAILABILITY OF  32GB OR 64GB VERSION
      
      
      ESPECIALLY THE 2GB RAM(AVAILABLE IN CANADA,US AND KOREA) IS A SLAP IN THE FACE FOR EVERY SAMSUNG FAN IN INDIA. JOIN THE PROTEST IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE CAUSE AND SHOW YOUR DISPLEASURE AT EVERY SAMSUNG FORUM ONLINE OR OTHERWISE.
      
      
      SAMSUNG IS SHOWING WHY WE NEVER SHOULD BE LOYAL TO A BRAND AND JUST BE OBJECTIVE WHILE ANALYZING THE VALUE FOR MONEY AND FEATURES. UNFORTUNATELY SAMSUNG MAY DO WELL AGAIN DUE TO WEAK ANDROID COMPETITION. PROBABLY WE SHOULD FAVOR HTC WITH SOME LOVE SO THAT SAMSUNG FEELS THE HEAT AGAIN."
Galaxy S3,1,"SAMSUNG MOBILES ARE CRAP , I PURCHASED GALAXY NOTE, IT USED TO GET RED HOT, SO HOT THAT I WOULD HAVE LOST MY EARS IF I HAD USED IT MORE THAN 3 MTHS, I SOLD IT , U KNOW WHAT I SOLD IT AT A LOSS OF 7000/- . FROM 32000 TO 25000 IN FLAT 2 MTHS OR SO.  SAMSUNG U WILL REPENT FOR THIS.
      
      WHEN INDIANS LOSE THERE MONEY NO COMPANY CAN STAY HERE, U ARE OFF NOW SAMSUNG.
      
      
      NEXT LIKE A UTTER FOOL I THOUGHT MAY BE COZ OF BIG SIZE THIS MUST HAVE GOT HOT AND I WAS A DIE HARD SAMSUNG FOLLOWER, SO LETS GIVE IT A BENEFIT OF DOUBT SO I PURCHASED AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT SAMSUNG S DUOS RECENTLY JUST 2 MTHS BACK IT IS LAUCHED JUST LIKE S3  DESIGN.
      
      NOW LISTEN MY STORY CAREFULLY, IN 1ST DAY I COULD NOT HEAR PROPERLY SIMPLE CALLS.
      
      I STARTED MY SPEAKER ON FOR JUST LISTENING TO OTHER PERSON ON PHONE, WHOLE WORLD WAS ALSO LISTENING TO ME. I SAID OK LETS BOOST THE SPEAKERS DOWNLOADED ""SOUND BOOSTER "" APP FROM ANDRIOD IT HELPED A BIT.
      
      THEN WHILE SIMPLE APPS AND MULTITASKING , LAGGING STARTED IN PHONE , SUCH WAS THE LAG EFFECT THAT I USED TO PAUSE FOR 10 SECS FOR EVERY COMMAND I ENTERED WHAT A WASTE OF TIME, SIMPLE SEARCH OF CONTACTS WAS TAKING TIME OF MORE THAN 8-10SECS. SHIT PHONE.
      
      SOLD IT A LOSS , AGAIN I AM FOOLED FROM 17500 - 14000 , A LOSS OF 3500 AGAIN

Galaxy S3,1,SAMSUNG PROVES AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY ARE JACK OF ALL TRADE MASTER OF NONE... DON'T BUY THIS MOBILE AND WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY... THERE ARE LOOOOOTSS OF OPTIONS IN THE MARKET... LOOK OUT FOR MOTOROLA RAZR AS AN IMMEDIATE OPTION...
Galaxy S3,1,"SAMSUNG S3 : IT BAGS ALL ROUNDER TAG IF THE PRICE COMES TO AROUND RS.30000/-. PAYING 38900 FOR A MOBILE IS NOT AT ALL A WISE DECISION.
      
      
      THE LOOKS DOESN'T PLACE S3 IN ESTEEM GROUP.
      
      
      8 MEGA PIXEL CAMERA IN S3- NOT EXPECTED. AT THIS PRICE RANGE THE CAMERA MUST BE OF 12-MEGA PIXEL.
      
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS GR8..ONE MUST APPRECIATE SAMSUNG FOR THIS.
      
      
      QUAD-CORE: TECHNOLOGY WISE GR88 BUT FOR MOBILE AT THIS STAGE IS NOT A ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT BASED ON ANDROID APPLICATION AVAILABLE IN MARKET.
      
      
      AS SUCH THE MARKET CONDITION IS NOT GOOD AND INFLATION IS TOO HIGH IN INDIA WHICH WILL DEFINITELY DRAG THIS PRICE DOWN."
Galaxy S3,1,"THE MOBILE WHICH I BOUGHT FOR 38,900 SIX MONTHS BACK IS NOW ONLY 28,000.
      
      MAY BE PEOPLE WHO BUY IT NOW BEWARE AFTER 6 MONTHS IT WILL BE ONLY 18,000.
      
      THE SERVICE IS TOO BAD. THEY GIVE AN OPTION TO UPDATE THE ANDROID VERSION THROUGH WIFI, BUT THE PHONE GETS HANGED AFTER YOU DO IT.
      
      YOU HAVE TO GO TO SERVICE CENTER AGAIN AND THEY WONT REPAIR THE MOBILE WITHOUT BILL EVEN IF ITS BRAND NEW... LEARN FROM NOKIA. YOU WONT NEED A BILL FOR A 1100 ALSO.
      
      YOU WILL HAVE TO EITHER CARRY BILL ALL THE TIME IN YOUR POCKET OR KEEP SHELLING OUT MORE AND MORE MONEY.
      
      SAMSUNG YOU ARE NO WAY EVEN NEAR BY IPHONE. LEARN THE BASICS FIRST."
Galaxy S3,1,"THE OS IS GREAT...THE PHONES FAST...THE SCREEN'S FEEL IS AMAZING!
      
      BUT AND THIS IS BIG BUT!
      
      THE PHONE HANGS (THE SCREEN GOES BLACK)ONLY A RESTART HELPS...
      
      IT HEATS UP LIKE CRAZY ESP WHEN BROWSING
      
      CALLS GO BLANK...PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END FIND IT HARD TO HEAR YOU...
      
      NOT ALL THE FEATURES WORK ALL THE TIME...
      
      SERVICE AT THE SERVICE CENTERS IS HORRIBLE...THEY KEEP YOU RUNNING PILLAR TO POST...STARTED FACING THESE ISSUES WITHIN TWO DAYS OF MY PURCHASE AND INSTEAD OF EXCHANGING THE PIECE THEY CHANGED THE MOTHER BOARD AND THINGS WENT EVEN MORE BAD AFTER THAT, THE CONTACTS KEEP FAILING TO WORK...NO ONE SEEMS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY...THEY GOT LEARN TO DELIVER GOOD PHONES AND JUST NOT HAVE LURING ADVERTISEMENTS"
Galaxy S3,1,THIS PHONE HAS NO FEAUTRES AS EXPECTED. SONY XPERIA HAVE GOOD PHONES AND CHEAPER THAN SAMSUNG.XPERIA S HAS A MORE GOOD PROCESSOR THAN THE S3 . S3 HAS A CAMERA OF 8MP WHEREIN XPERIA S HAS A 12MP CAMERA.THE COST OF S3 IS ABOUT 35000 AND XPERIA IS JUST 30000 SO WOULD BE A XPERIA WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE. THANK YOU CHINMAY KHIRDIKAR
Galaxy S3,1,"THIS PHONE WONT FIT IN ANY AVERAGE INDIAN SHIRT'S FRONT POCKET WILL DEFENITELY PROTUDE OUT.
      
      
      FOR A PRODUCT OF THIS PRICE RANGE PEOPLE WITH ESTEEM NEED ALONE BUYS.
      
      
      SAMSUNG COULD HAVE SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME IN IMPROVISING THE DESIGN.
      
      I HAVE ONE WORD FOR THE S3 DESIGN ""YUCK"".
      
      
      QUADCORE..AMOLED..64 GB MEMORY CARD COMPATABILITY...IS ALL FINE.
      
      WHEN YOU GRAB THE PHONE TO YOUR EAR, YOU SHOULD NOT GET A EXTERNAL LOOK OF HOLDING A SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR TO YOUR EAR.
      
      
      DO THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS ONE..!"
Galaxy S3,1,"WHEN I BROUGHT THE PHONE IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PIECE OF HARDWARE. I WILL JUST JUMP TO 6 MONTH OWNERSHIP EXPERIENCE:
      
      
      1. THE JB UPDATE SCREWED THE PHONE. S3 BECAME SLUGGISH AND ALMOST UNUSABLE, SERVICE CENTER DID A SOFTWARE RESET WIPING OUT ALL THE DATA. THE PHONE BECAME BETTER BUT NOT AS GOOD AS IT WAS EARLIER.
      
      
      2. TWO MONTHS AFTER THE UPDATE, THE BATTERY STARTED TAKING VERY LONG TO CHARGE. THINGS CAME TO A PASS WHEN PHONE WENT DEAD WHILE GETTING CHARGED !!
      
      
      3. 40 MINUTE WAIT AT SERVICE STATION AND THE REP TOLD ME TO BUY A NEW CABLE.
      
      
      4. NO JOY - ANOTHER 30 MINUTE WAIT AND THEY RESET THE PHONE AGAIN. THE BATTERY ISSUE IS STILL PERSISTENT.
      
      
      HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PATIENCE TO GO TO SERVICE CENTER AGAIN, I DUSTED OF MY OLD IPHONE 4 AND 3 YEAR OLD IPHONE STILL WORKS BETTER THEN THE 6-MON OLD S3. AND TO THINK OF IT I HATED APPLE !!!!"
Galaxy S3,1,"WHEN I TRIED CHARGING THE PHONE AFTER RECEIVING IT, IT DOESN'T CHARGE. LIKE ANOTHER REVIEWER HERE, I SUSPECT THAT THE PHONE HAS A BAD CHARGING CIRCUIT. (IT'S POSSIBLE THAT FLIPKART SHIPPED ME THE FAULTY PHONE RETURNED BY THE OTHER REVIEWER).
      
      
      NOW I'M TOLD I MUST WAIT 24 HOURS FOR THE ""CONCERNED TEAM"" IN FLIPKART TO CALL ME.
      
      
      FRUSTRATING."
Galaxy S3,1,"YOU PUT MORE MONEY DEFINITELY YOU WILL GET SOMETHING BETTER, BUT MATTER IS HERE,WOULD U THINK ITS WISE TO BUY A MOBILE PHONE IN ~40 THOUSAND RS.AND THERE IS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS MOBILE.BETTER TO WAIT FOR WINDOWS 8 TABLETS. IT WILL WILL BE WORTH......"

HTC One V T320,5,"A VERY BEAUTIFUL DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE. I WAS USING HTC WINDOWS PHONE AND WHEN DECIDED TO GO FOR SMARTPHONE, MY CHOICE WAS HTC ONE V. EXCEPT THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO FRONT CAMERA FOR ICS, ITS PERFORMANCE, CAMERA, IS TRULY BEAUTIFUL.

HTC One V T320,5,"BEING A FIRST TIME ANDROID USER, I MUST SAY I AM MIGHTY IMPRESSED WITH THE HTC ONE V... IT HAS A BRILLIANT LOOK AND FEEL ABOUT IT AND THE TOUCHSCREEN IS REALLY SMOOTH. ONE OF THE OTHER BRILLIANT THING ABOUT THE PHONE IS ITS CAMERA. FOR A 5 MP CAMERA, THAT TOO FOR A PHONE, THIS HAS SOME AMAZING PROCESSING FEATURES LIKE HDR, GROUP PHOTO, PANORAMA MODE AND ALL. ITS BEEN 2 WEEKS AND SO FAR ITS BEEN REALLY GOOD. HOPE IT STAYS THIS WAY!!
      
      
      ON TOP OF IT ALL WOULD LIKE TO THANK FLIPKART FOR THEIR AMAZING DELIVERY. IT WAS DELIVERED WITHIN 36 HOURS, WHICH IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE."
HTC One V T320,5,"DELIVERED SWIFTLY, BEFORE PROMISED DATE, BY FLIPKART. I WAS A LITTLE UNEASY ABOUT BUYING A MOBILE WITHOUT HANDLING IT PHYSICALLY. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH ITS APPEARANCE WHEN I OPENED THE BOX. HOLDING IT IN MY PALM IT FELT QUITE SNUG.
      
      SETTING IT UP WAS A BREEZE. I'VE BEEN USING IT NOW FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT NOW. IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO WORK THINGS OUT. SOME FEATURES SEEM TO BE NESTLED A BIT DEEP INTO THE MENU STRUCTURE. BUT ONCE I GOT THE HANG OF IT MY PLEASURE MULTIPLIED.
      
      IF YOU USE THE PHONE IN THE MIDST OF, OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER, CHARGING IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE WARM AGAINST YOUR EAR.
      
      BATTERY LIFE DEPENDS ON USAGE PATTERNS. UNSURPRISINGLY SOME APPLICATIONS CONSUME MORE POWER THAN OTHERS.
      
      CALL QUALITY IS VERY GOOD, THOUGH IT WOULD ALSO DEPEND ON THE CARRIER AND LOCATION.
      
      I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PARTICULAR MENTION OF THE GREAT QUALITY OF THE BEATS AUDIO. EXCELLENT!
      
      VOIP CALLS OVER THE INTERNET, USING WIFI, WORKED VERY WELL. VIDEO CHAT IS NOT POSSIBLE AS IT DOESN'T HAVE A FRONTAL CAMERA.
      
      IN CONCLUSION, I'M EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE."

      I HAD S DUOS AND HTC ONE V AS THE CHOICES.
      
      BUT HTC CAMERA AND BEATS AUDIO MADE ME TO GO FOR HTC.
      
      THE BIGGEST PLUS FOR THIS MOBILE IS THE REBOOT TIME.

HTC One V T320,5,"HTC ONE V ROCKS!!! IT HAS VERY ENTERTAINING FEATURE OF LIFT PHONE FOR RINGTONE SILENT, FLIP MOB FOR SPEAKER, SHAKE MOB FOR SCREENSHOT OF VIDEO PLAYED ETC. ITS AWESOME THE ONLY DRAWBACK HTC MOBILES HAVE IS THEY PROCLAIM BEATS AUDIO BUT DONT GIVE HTC BEATS EARPHONE FREE. IT COSTS 8000RS BUT COULD BE BUNDLED WITH HTC MOBILE. THE PERFORMANCE IS AWESOME IF YOUR TASK MANAGER LIST IS FULL CLEAR.
      
      
      THE DISPLAY IS AWESOME. TOUCH ALSO VERY GOOD NO NEED TO UPGRADE ANYTHING.
      
      
      ONE FEATURE I DONT UNDERSTAND IS WHY BLUETOOTH FILES TRANSFERRED IS STORED ONLY ON MOBILE MEMORY IT HAS NO OPTION TO SAVE IN MEMORY CARD WHICH IS A HEADACHE. I HAVE TO KEEP THE SPACE FREE AND I CANT TRANSFER ANT BIG VIDEO FILE IN BLUETOOTH.

HTC One V T320,5,"I GOT THIS PHONE AROUND 2 WEEKS BACK FROM FLIPKART IN 17.3K WITH 8GB MEMORY CARD &AMP; SAMSUNG BLUETOOTH WITHOUT CHARGER.
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS REALLY AWESOME. NICE TOUCH, CAMERA QUALITY IS BRILLIANT WITH LED FLASH. ANDROID 4.0 IS GREAT IN THIS RANGE. PROCESSOR IS SUPER FAST NEVER FACE ANY HANGING PROBLEM. SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD NOT LIKE CHINESE PHONE. LOOK WISE RICH AND COOL.
      
      
      OVERALL BEST PHONE IN THIS RAGE MUST HAVE IT AND FLIPKART SERVCIE NEVER LET YOU DOWN. I HAVE RECEIVED MY ORDER IN 1 DAY.
      
      
      HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCT..."
HTC One V T320,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ALMOST A MONTH NOW, NO ISSUES, VERY HAPPY WITH BOTH FLIPKART AND HTC. I HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT THIS PHONE AS LOT OF PEOPLE HAD REPORTED PROBLEMS WITH TOUCH SCREEN, BUT IT HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE JOY SO FAR. PACKAGE CONTAINED EVERYTHING PROMISED, 8 GB DATA CARD AND THE BLUETOOTH HEADSET FROM FLIPKART. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
HTC One V T320,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR OVER A MONTH NOW AND I MUST SAY  THAT YOU CAN'T AND I MEAN, YOU JUST CAN'T BUY A BETTER SMARTPHONE IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE AS HTC ONE V. THE DISPLAY IS REALLY GOOD BUT THE THING THAT REALLY CATCHES THE EYE IS THE SUPERB PICTURE QUALITY OF THE PHOTOS TAKEN FROM THE 5MP CAMERA IT'S LIKE USING 8 OR 10MP CAMERA."

HTC One V T320,5,I LKE THE HTC ONE V PHONE CAMERA IS VERY NICE PROCESSOR IS SINGLE CORE 512 RAM AND INTERNAL MEMORY IS 4GB AND PHONE IS VERY SLIM AND LIGHT WEIGHT LED FLASH IS GOOD RUUNING GAMES ARE GOOD SAMSUNG RESOULATION IS GOOD BUT HTC RESOULATION IS VERY NICE I LIKE THE PHONE  ILKE THE PHONE BETTERY BACK IS GOOD
HTC One V T320,5,"I PURCHASE THIS MOBILE B4 2 WEEK. AND BELIEVE ME, ITS GREAT... I WAS CONFUSED BETWEEN SONY XPERIA NEO V, AND HTC ONE V AS BOTH BRAND IS BEST IN QUALITY PRODUCTS. (SAMSUNG IS WORST) AND FINALLY I PURCHASE THIS ONE. CAMERA QUALITY, FANTASTIC. SONGS TO GOOD. IN SHORT THIS IS GREAT MOBILE. GO FOR IT.."
HTC One V T320,5,"I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS HANDSET AND I'M ABSOLUTELY LOVING IT. THE SERVICE BY FLIPKART WAS GOOD TOO THOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAD TO WAIT ALL 4 DAYS TO GET MY PHONE DELIVERED (MAINLY DUE TO WEEKENDS IN BETWEEN) BUT ONCE I GOT MY HANDSET I WAS VERY VERY HAPPY.
      
      
      ITS BEEN A WEEK SINCE I'M USING THIS HANDSET AND I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT."
HTC One V T320,5,"I WAS SHOCKD HOW CAN ONE GIVE SOO MUCH IN JUST A PHONE.....
      
      IT'S NO JOKE, THIS IS A TRUE MULTIMEDIA PHONE FOR ANY AGE GROUP..
      
      I MYSELF AM A IPHONE 4S USER BUT YES TO SEE FEATURES OF IOS ON A ANDROID WITH ALL THANKS TO HTC IS A FAB JOB......
      
      I DON'T THINK IF U R CONVIENCE WITH PRICE THEN LOOK NOWHERE ELSE....
      
      YES SMALL MISTAKES OR RATHER SERVICE IS COTLY BUT THIS IS A MINI IPHONE FOR ANDROID USERS........."
HTC One V T320,5,"IF U DONT KNO ALREADY.. THIS PHONE ORIGINALLY LAUNCHED WITH A LOWER PRICE TAG OF 18,299..N LATER DROPPED TO A MUCH COOLER PRICE OF 17,435.. BUT RECENTLY.. BECAUSE OF ITS POPULARITY N VOLATILITY OF STOCK, HTC INDIA WAS BOUND TO BOUNCE THE PRICE UP..SO I HAD TO BUY IT FRM SOMEWHERE ELSE AT A LOWER PRICE.. IF U WANNA KNO WHY THIS PHONE GAINED THIS MUCH POPULARITY..THEN READ ON..
      
      
      AFTER 7 DAYS WITH THIS PHONE..I CAN SAY FINALLY CONVINCE SOMEONE THAT THE RACE IS NOT ALL DUAL-CORE/QUAD-CORE, BUT ALSO DESIGN.. THE LATTER IS WHERE HTC HAS HIT PERFECTLY..
      
      
      IN TERMS OF DESIGN.. U GET A VERY PREMIUM UNI-BODY PHONE..PART WHICH MEANS THE BATTERY IS NOT USER-REMOVABLE AND PART WHICH GIVES U THE REALLY THIN BODY..
      
      THE DESIGN IS EXCELLENT AND THE ONE V IS ITSELF THINNER THAN THE IPHONE..THE 'CHIN' OF THE PHONE GIVES IT A UNIQUE LOOK..
      
      CONTRARY TO WHAT/HOW IT LOOKS LIKE IN PICTURES, IT LOOKS VERY GOOD IN REAL LIFE.. INFACT PROTECTS THE DISPLAY WHEN LYING ON THE FACE..
      
      
      THE BACK OF THE CHIN IS WHERE THE FULL SIZE SIM CARD IS LOADED AND ALONGSIDE A MICROSD SLOT.. ALTHOUGH HTC DOES NOT ADVERTISE THIS, BUT U DO GET A FREE 8 GB MICROSD CARD..
      
      
      ALSO THERE IS A SMALL STRIPE OF NOTIFICATION LED BESIDE THE 3.5 MM JACK.. IT IS ALONG THE EDGE SO IT CAN BE VIEWD WHEN THE PHONE IS LYING ON EITHER FACE..
      
      
      THE MATERIAL USED FOR THE BODY IS ANODISED ALUMINIUM N THE DISPLAY IS PROTECTED BY GORILLA GLASS..
      
      
      NOW FOR THE INTERNALS AND PERFORMANCE..
      
      
      THIS IS THE BEST U CAN GO WITHOUT BREAKING THE BANK AND GETTING A FULLY LOADED ICS PHONE.. SURELY.. BUT BEFORE U SCREAM 'XPERIA SOLA' LET ME REMIND U THAT SOLA HAS ONLY 1320MAH BATTERY..WHICH WOULDNT LAST EVEN HALF A DAY WITH ALL THE WHITEMAGIC N BRAVIA JUNKIES.. I HAVE USED DUALCORES BUT THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE OS IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.. THE ONLY DIFFERNCE IS WHEN U PLAY GRAPHICS HUNGRY  GAMES (WHICH IS NOT FOR EVERYONE).. GAMES UPTO 'TEMPLE RUN' PLAY WELL..ANGRY BIRDS R CHILDS GAME FOR IT.. BUT  NOVA N THE LIKE DONT PLAY WELL (IT DOES NOT EVEN APPEAR IN THE PLAY STORE)..
      
      
      BENCHMARKS SAY THAT THE PHONE IS A MIDRANGER N LIES SOMEWHER BETWN THE SOLA N THE ORIGINAL GALAXY  S BUT THE PHONE FEELS QUITE FLUID ON ITS OWN.. IT SCORES 29FPS IN NENAMARK2..COMPARE THAT TO SOLA AT 27.7FPS.. SUNSPIDER (LOWR IS BTR) 3299 (ONE V) VS 2837 (SOLA)..
      
      
      BATTERY IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT TO B CONSIDERD N THIS IS WHER D 1500MAH WINS.. SINGLE CORE ONE V GOT ME THROU 1.5 DAY UNDER NORMAL USAGE (BRIGHTNESS ON AUTO, WCDMA/GSM AUTO, WIFI ABT 1 HR, GAMING 20 MIN, MUSIC 3HRS)
      
      
      IN TERMS OF OS AESTHETICS.. U GET HTC SENSE 4.0..THE SAME ONE IN THE HTC ONE X BUT WITH SOME MISSING FEATURES..LIKE DLNA N THE RECENT APPS (WHICH IS VANILLA ICS, N IS BETTR THAN THE HTC VERSION) N NO. OF HOMESCREENS (LOCKED TO 5, STRANGELY)..
      
      
      OTHER THINGS MISSING R THE MAGNETOMETER (READ DIGITAL COMPASS) N THE FRONT-FACIN CAM.. WHILE THESE MAY APPEAR SERIOUS BLANK SPACES IN THE SPEC-SHEET (TO SOME) BUT I DOUBT HOW MANY TIMES A DAY ONE MIGHT ACTUALLY USE THEM..
      
      
      HTC NOTES INTERNAL MEMORY AS 4GB BUT WHAT U GET IS EXACTLY 962 MB OF APP STORAGE AND 95.23 MB OF PHONE STORAGE.. SOME MIGHT NOT BE HAPPY WITH THIS.. BUT U HAVE TO ADD THAT U STILL GET 100 MB OF STORAGE FOR YOUR RINGTONES N WALLPAPERS AND A FREE 8 GB FOR MUSIC N VIDS N MOVIES.. SHOULD BE ENUF FOR NEWBIES..
      
      
      SOLVING SOME ISSUES THAT OTHER REVIEWERS POSTED..
      
      
      1. OVERHEATING: YES.. THE PHONE OVERHEATS TO ABT 40 C.. BUT OTHERS DID NOT MENTION WHEN..!! THE PHONE OVERHEATS WHEN MISHANDLED.. LIKE PLAYIN WITH D PHONE DURING CHARGING.. TAKING FOR LONG HOURS WITH THE HAND COVERING THE ENTIRE BACK.. EXCESSIVE FIDDLING LIKE WIFI USAGE/HEAVY GAMING FOR LONG HOURS WITH BACK OF THE PHONE LYING ON THE PALM.. THUS NOT COVERING THE ENTIRE BACK CAN SIGNIFICANTLY BRING TEMPERATURES DOWN..
      
      
      2.YELLOW DISPLAY: I LOOKED REALLY CLOSELY BUT DID NOT FIND ANY SUCH PROBLEMS.. ACCORDING TO HTC, PRODUCTS SHIPPED BEFORE APR BATCH HAD PROBLEMS..
      
      
      CONCLUSION.. ALL SAID.. THIS IS CERTAINLY THE DROID U R LOOKING FOR IF U WNT SMOOTH ICS PERFORMANCE N PREMIUM BUILD QUALITY.. IF U R STIL INTO DUALCORES.. GO WASTE SOMEONE ELSES TIME.."
HTC One V T320,5,"IT HAS BEEN A DAY USING THIS PHONE AND I LIKE EVERYTHING ABUT THIS PHONE.ITS A MONSTER PHONE WHICH ITS LOTS OF BATTERY BUT STAND UPTO MY EXPECTATION FROMA 17K PHONE.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1.IT HAS A G-SENSOR WHICH FLIPKART HAVENT STATED.
      
      2.HTC UI ROCKS.MAN THERE NO BETTER UI FOR ANDROID THEN HTC SENSE.
      
      3.BEATS AUDIO IS SO CLEAR AND CRISP.
      
      4.THE TOUCH RESPONCE IS AWESOME.
      
      
      AND NO OTHER WORDS FOR THIS PHONE A SINGLE WORD DESCRIBES IT ""AWESOME!""
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      1.IT HEATS UP QUICKY AS ITS A UNIBODY METAL MADE.BUT NOT A BIG PROBLEM.
      
      2.NO SECONDARY CAMERA.
      
      3.NO BEATS AUDIO HEADFONE..
      
      
      THAT WAS A HONEST REVIEW ABUT THIS PHONE AND I WOULD SAY PREFER HTC ONE V AND NOT SONT NEOV BECAUSE NO ONE CANNOT MATCH SOLIDITY OF A PHONE BETTER THAN HTC... MAYBE THE PROCESSOR AND SECONDARY WOULD BE THERE IN NEOV BUT U DONT GET SO GOOD DESIGN AND SOLID FEEL IN SONY.
      
      
      -YASH SIGNING OUT-"
HTC One V T320,5,"IT HAS BEEN ONE MONTH SINCE I AM USING THIS PHONE.MY REVIEW IS HONEST.THIS PHONE HAS EVERYTHING YOU WANT.ANDROID ICS MAKE IT VERY USER FRIENDLY.DOESNT GO SLOW EVEN AFTER HEAVY MULTITASKING.YOU KNOW ONE EXPECTS SOME SMALL THINGS IN HIS PHONE WHICH MAKES HIM FEEL THAT I WISH IT HAD THIS,I WISH IT HAD THAT.BUT THIS PHONE HAS IT ALL.AWESOME DISPLAY,BEATS AUDIO ROCKS,NET WORKS REALLY WELL,GREAT CAMERA,LOOKS CANT JUST B COMPARED!THIS PHONE STANDS OUT OF THE REST..DONT HESITATE TO BUY IT..HTC ONE V IS MIND BLOWING!!"
HTC One V T320,5,"IT IS AWESOME PHONE.ALL THE LATEST APPS AND GAMES RUN WITHOUT LAGGING.I PLAYED ASPHALT 7 AND IT RAN WONDERFULLY.PHONE LOOKS VERY SEXY AND EASILY FITS IN THE HAND.CAMERA IS AWESOME.MAN I LOVE IT.
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      1]SPEAKER IS NOT SO POWERFUL.
      
      2]CAN`T DISTINGUISH BEAT AUDIO"
HTC One V T320,5,"IT'S A GREAT PHONE. THERE ARE NO HEATING PROBLEMS TOO.. WI-FI WORKS SUPERBLY AND CAMERA IS EXCELLENT. THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE IS THE OPTIONS BUTTON WHICH WE HAD IN THE OTHER PHONES... I'M AN ANDROID USER FROM YEARS AND NOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO HAVE IT IN MY MIND THAT ME PHONE DOESN'T HAS THE OPTIONS BUTTON AND HAS THE ""RECENT APPS"" BUTTON INSTEAD. 1 MORE THING- THE 1GHZ SINGLE-CORE PROCESSOR WORKS FINE BUT IT DOES GET STUCK OR FREEZES FOR A SECOND SOMETIMES... HOWEVER, PEOPLE ASK THIS QUESTION FREQUENTLY- ""HOW WILL I REBOOT/MAKE MY PHONE WORK AGAIN WHEN IT HANGS COMPLETELY?"" HERE'S THE ANSWER- THE PHONE DOESN'T HANG (AT LEAST I'VE NOT EXPERIENCED SUCH A SITUATION ON MY ONE V...). IT JUST STOPS FOR A SECOND (SOMETIMES) AND THEN IT'S ALRIGHT. AND I HAVE NO YELLOW SPOTS TOO. ONLY THE THING IS THAT IT'S VERY NECESSARY TO GET A SCRATCH GUARD IMMEDIATELY AS ""I'M THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR"" STICKER HAS TO BE REMOVED SO THAT WE CAN USE THE PHONE... IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO GET A NICE COVER SO THAT THE GREAT BACK METAL BODY DOESN'T LOOSE IT'S GREATNESS. MOREOVER WE GET AN 8GB MEMORY CARD FREE WITH THIS PHONE!!"
HTC One V T320,5,"ITS A VERY GOOD PHONE, ANOTHER ONE FROM HTC.
      
      PREVIOUSLY I HAVE USED HTC WILDFIRE S.
      
      DISPLAY QUALITY VERY GOOD, VERY SATISFIED WITH ICS 4.
      
      AS USUAL HTC SENCE IS GREAT.
      
      
      ONLY FEW THINGS MISSING, DIGITAL COMPASS AND FRONT CAMERA, WHICH I RARELY NEED.
      
      
      AS FOR FRONT CAMERA. I COULD USE SKYPE VIDEO CHAT WHITH THE REAR CAMERA, THOUGH SEEMS ODD, BUT IT SERVES THE PURPOSE.
      
      
      OVER ALL GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY."
HTC One V T320,5,"IT'S BEEN 2 MONTHS SO FAR AND I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE MY PHONE MORE AND MORE.. I HAD HTC WILDFIRE S BEFORE THIS, SO I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HTC. I AM SURE GLAD I STICKED ONTO HTC..
      
      
      CONS: VERY MINOR BUT STILL. CALL QUALITY (LESS AUDIBLE) COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. BATTERY BACKUP CAN ONLY BE BLAMED ON ANDROID THAN THE HANDSET."
HTC One V T320,5,"IT'S BEEN 20 DAYS OWNING THIS PHONE NOW, AND THE EXPERIENCE IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.
      
      
      5 MP PRIMARY CAMERA
      
      3.7-INCH TOUCHSCREEN
      
      1 GHZ PROCESSOR
      
      ANDROID V4 (ICE CREAM SANDWICH)
      
      PLUS MANY MORE FEATURES INSIDE 20K IS AMAZING.
      
      
      I LIKE THE ""INTERNET PASS-THROUGH"" CONNECT TO THE INTERNET VIA PC.
      
      
      VERY GOOD SERVICE FROM FLIPKART."
HTC One V T320,5,MY MOM BOUGHT THIS HANDSET ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND I HAVE TO SAY..IT'S THE BEST U CAN GET IN THIS RANGE..BELIEVE IT OR NOT!! HTC HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH THIS ONE!! CONGRATS HTC!! AND IF UR THINKING WHETHER TO BUY IT OR NOT..THEN UR A FOOL..!! :P JUST GO FOR IT!! U WILL NOT REGRET UR DECISION!! :D :D :D
HTC One V T320,5,"NICE GIZMO FROM HTC...WOULD HAVE WAITED A BIT FOR PRICE TO DROP, BUT NEEDED ONE IMMEDIATELY, SO BOUGHT IT, AND GOT A PRETTY GOOD DEAL TOO.
      
      
      QUITE IMPRESSED WITH IT'S FORM FACTOR, PRESENCE AND FUNCTIONALITY. HAS ALL THE APPS I NEED TO KEEP UP-TO-DATE ON WORK-RELATED MAILS AND MESSAGES.
      
      
      PRETTY INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE...FAST AND RESPONSIVE TOUCH. LAGS IF DOING TOO MANY THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY, BUT SO DOES MY LAPPY...CAN'T BLAME THE LITTLE THING.
      
      
      MY REASON FOR BUYING THIS PHONE WAS THE CAMERA, AND IT TURNS OUT PRETTY DECENT PICS...NO COMPLAINS THERE.
      
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS A CONCERN WHEN USING WI-FI, GPS OR SURFING AT A STRETCH, BUT NOTHING I CAN'T LIVE WITH...MY USAGE FOR THE SAME IS ANYWAY LIMITED.
      
      
      CAN'T SPEAK FOR IT'S GAMING PERFORMANCE...DIDN'T BUY IT FOR THAT, BUT MY SON HAS GOOD TIME PLAYING WITH TOM CAT."
HTC One V T320,5,"ONE CAN'T FIND A BETTER PHONE THAN THIS ONE IN THIS RANGE, SUPERFAST, USER FRIENDLY, CAM AND SOUND QUALITY ARE SECOND TO NONE...
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS OVER ANYPHONE BELOW 20K RANGE.. PURCHASE WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT, IM USING IT FROM PAST 3 MONTHS, NO HANGING PROBLEM, NOTHING...."
HTC One V T320,5,"ORDERED AND GOT FROM FLIPKART ON APRIL, THE WEEK IT GOT RELEASED. ASUSUAL FLIPKART DOES PUT EXTRA EFFORT ON PACKAGING. I HAVE USED MANY ANDROID PHONES BUT ITS MY FIRST OF MY OWN. MANY DIDNT PREFER THE HANDREST DESIGN AT FIRST BUT I JUST LOVED IT. THE LOOK AND FEEL WAS JST AMAZED ME. FROM MY VIEW HERE ARE THE +VS AND -VS.
      
      PROS:-
      
      1) DISPLAY JUST ROCKS. PROCESSING SPEED IS AWESOME AND IN THIS CASE, HTC ONE V IS A CHARM.
      
      2) NO FRAMING OR LAGS IN GAME/APPS. HATS OFF (I AM BIG GAME FREAK SO I JUST LOVE IT)
      
      3) BATTERY IS REASONABLE BUT I DONT KNOW WHETHER ITS A PRO OR CON BUT I STAY ON NEUTRAL SIDE WHEN IT COMES TO BATTERY LIFE, ITS REASONABLE.
      
      4) VID QUALITY WAS JST ASTONISHING AND I HOPE ALL HTC ONE USER WILL JST LOVE THE VID+PIC CAPTURING FEATURE. ITS NEW TO THE BOARD.
      
      5) UNSCRATCHABLE DISPLAY -HMM I DUNO WHETHER ITS TRUE IT HAS GORILLA DISPLAY WHICH CANNOT BE SCRATCHED. BUT I HOPE SO COS IT DIDNT GOT SCRATCHD FOR ME EVEN WHEN I PUT MY KEYS AND MY PPHONES IN SAME POCKET, WHICH ELIMINATES THE NEED OF SCRATCH GUARD.
      
      6) SENSITIVTY IS JST AMAZING. I HATE TOUCH PHONES BUT WITH HTC ONE V IT JST TURNED THE TABLE.
      
      
      CONS-
      
      1)I MIGHT HAVE LOST MY EYE POWER BY PLAYING GAMES IN THIS DISPLAY FR JST 2HRS OR SO. ITS NOT VERY FRIENDLY IN THIS CASE.
      
      2) THERE ARE SOME USABILITY ISSUES HERE AND THERE, WHERE AT THIS COST IT MUST BE AVOIDED.
      
      
      OVERALL I AM VERY HAPPY I GOT THIS PHONE EARLY AS POSSIBLE, NOW THE PRIZES HAVE GONE UP. CHEERS TO HTC ONE V :)"
HTC One V T320,5,"PEOPLE SAY HTC PHONES ARE GREAT. IT MUST BE TRUE BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY  NOT WITH MY CASE.  MY HANDSET WAS PLAGUED WITH PROBLEMS FROM DAY ONE.
      
      1- BATTERY HEATING UP
      
      2-YELLOW SPOT ON LCD
      
      3- CAMERA NOT WORKING
      
      4- SIGNAL LOSS
      
      
      TOOK IT TO THE HTC SERVICE CENTER AND THEY EVEN ADMITTED THAT THIS MODEL HAS LOT OF ISSUES.
      
      
      ANYWAY FLIPKART SAVED THE DAY AND HAVE AGREED TO GIVE ME A REFUND.
      
      
      BEST OF LUCK"
HTC One V T320,5,"SAW..  DID SOME RESEARCH.. THEN BOUGHT IT...
      
      
      FLIPKART SERVICE... NICE... VERY GOOD...
      
      
      ABOUT THE PHONE:
      
      YOU MAYBE KNOW THE PROS ALREADY... YEAH THIS ONE HAS A HELL OF A CAMERA. THE PICTURES PRODUCED ARE SUPERB. AND IF ONE TWEAKS WITH THE SETTINGS (CAMERA SETTINGS) A BIT, HE/SHE WOULD GET EVEN MUCH BETTER PICTURE.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1)LOW LIGHT IMAGES HAS NOISE. ONE CAN IDENTIFY THE NOISES IN THE IMAGE. STILL ITS SOMETHING A NORMAL USER CAN IGNORE.
      
      
      2) PLEASE KNOW THIS.. THIS PHONE HAS 1 GHZ SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR ... SO, WHEN ONE HAS THE WI-FI/MOBILE INTERNET SWITCHED ON AND IS TRYING TO PLAY GAMES OR EVEN TRYING TO DIAL SOMEONE .. IT LAGS THEN..  EVEN WHILE YOU BROWSE IT RESPONDS SLOW, AND LAGS A LOT. THIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE, I WOULD ASK OTHERS TO GO FOR A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR. (DUAL CORE ARE COMFORTABLE TO HANDLE MULTITASKING )
      
      
      3) THIS PHONE HANGS .. LIKE IN EVERY 5-6 DAYS OF CONTINUOUS RUNNING , YOU NEED TO RESTART THE PHONE TO KEEP IT RUNNING SMOOTHLY.[ THIS IS WHAT I SAW, ACTUALLY ]
      
      
      TO BE PRECISE....  I PLAYED A LOT OF GAMES ON THIS PHONE FOR THE FIRST 2-3 MONTHS.. THEN SLOWLY AND SLOWLY LOST INTEREST IN GAMING. NOW ALL I DO IS CALL AND PHOTO-SHOOT/VIDEO RECORDING... SO SINCE THE CAMERA IS SUPERB, IT WORKS FOR ME... AND WITH ONLY 3-5 GAMES INSTALLED, IT DOESN'T HANG SO MUCH...
      
      DO GET A SCREEN (SCRATCH GUARD) WHILE PURCHASING THIS, TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.. :)"
HTC One V T320,5,"SO I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR TWO MONTHS NOW AND ITS JUST BRILLIANT.

      2.ICS
      
      3.HTC SENSE IS AMAZING
      
      4.REALLY GOOD BATTERY BACK UP.
      
      5.CAMERA IS GOOD ENOUGH IF YOU ARE NOT A HARDCORE 'PROFESSIONAL'
      
      6.DISPLAY IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PHONE IN THIS RANGE.
      
      7.FEELS GOOD TO HOLD,THE ALUMINUM BODY GIVES IT A PREMIUM FEEL.
      
      
      CONS.
      
      1.GETS HEATED WHILE PLAYING HD GAMES(DEPENDS ON THE ROOM,NO ISSUES IN AN AIR-CONDITIONED ROOM)
      
      2.THE IN CALL VOLUME SEEMS A BIT LOW IF YOU ARE IN A NOISY ENVIRONMENT.
      
      3.EARPHONES COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER(I SUGGEST TEKFUSION - TWINWOOFERS IN-EAR HEADPHONES.)
      
      
      OVERALL ITS A VERY GOOD PHONE..AND YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THIS PRICE RANGE."
HTC One V T320,5,"THE PRICE IS LOW AND THAT MAKES IT ALL THE MORE SPECIAL.
      
      THE BATTERY LIFE IS THE ONLY PROBLEM. WITH ONLY 1500 MAH THE BATTERY HARDLY GOES ON FOR THE WHOLE DAY. I HOPE IF I COULD UPGRADE IT TO THE 1800 MAH. THE OTHER FEATURES LIKE THE BEATS AUDIO, RECORDING ETC ARE JUST UNBELIEVABLE !!
      
      I LOVE IT AND SURELY U WOULD LOVE IT TOO !!"
HTC One V T320,5,"THIS IS A HONEST REVIEW AND I DON'T GO BY THE THE CERTIFIED TAG. I HAVE SEEN THE REVIEWS ON THE INTERNET COMPREHENSIVELY. I HAVE SEEN THE RESULTS ON YOUTUBE AS WELL. I TYPED IN HTC ONE V FOR A WEEK ON YOUTUBE JUST TO WATCH ALL THE REVIEWS AND IN THE END I DECIDED TO BUY NOT FOR THE MONEY PART BUT FOR THE TECH PART OF THIS PHONE. I COULD'VE BOUGHT A NOKIA LUMIA 800 OR EVEN A SAMSUNG OMNIA W IF I WANTED A WINDOWS BASED PHONE BUT ANDROID 4.0 ICS IS AWESOME.
      
      
      HERE GOES THE CLICHED PROS AND CONS.
      
      
      PROS
      
      1. GREAT BUILD, GOOD TO HOLD AND FEEL.
      
      2. GREAT SCREEN, AS TOLD BY MANY WHOM I SHOWED THE PHONE.
      
      3. GOOD BATTERY LIFE FOR A HTC, I'VE SEEN PEOPLE TALK BAD ABOUT BATTERY LIFE IN HTC PHONE BUT SURPRISINGLY IT IS GOOD ENOUGH.
      
      4. GOOD PHONE NAVIGATION FOR ICS WHICH WAS ABSENT IN GINGERBREAD BUT IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS WP7 MANGO
      
      5. GREAT CAMERA WITH GREAT FEATURES IN IT SHOOT AND CAPTURE IS THE WAY IT IS.
      
      
      NOW, FOR THE CONS I WOULDN'T REALLY COMPLAIN BUT IT IS AN AREA OF IMPROVEMENT TO BE DONE BY THE HTC PEOPLE.
      
      
      CONS
      
      1. GETS HEATED WHEN PLAYING GRAPHIC INTENSE GAME, BUT NOT SO MUCH TO BOTHER ABOUT AS IT DOESN'T BURN, IMAGINE THE HEAT IN YOUR COMPUTER'S CPU OR EVEN YOUR LAPTOP'S CPU RUNNING A HIGH GRAPHIC GAME, CONSIDERING THAT SCALE IT IS GOOD ENOUGH.
      
      2. INBUILT BATTERY IS NOT A CON BUT IT IS DEFINITELY BOTHERING, IT STAYS IN YOUR MIND, WHAT IF MY PHONE FAILS TO BOOT UP BECAUSE THE BATTERY JUST WENT DEAD EVEN AFTER CHARGING( WORST CASE SCENARIO ).
      
      3. INTERNAL MEMORY, I WOULDN'T COMPLAIN BUT MANY PEOPLE WOULD BECAUSE IT IS A MAJOR THING. NOT MANY DO BUY AN SD CARD OF HIGH CAPACITY AND THANKS TO FLIPKART THEY ARE GIVING 16 GB OF MICROSD .SO IT IS WORTHY THE PRICE.
      
      4. THE SCREEN IS TOO GLOSSY FOR IT TO SUSTAIN SCRATCHES.
      
      
      OTHER THAN ALL OF THESE MINOR ISSUES I WOULDN'T COMPLAIN MUCH, INFACT THESE ARE NOT EVEN MY COMPLAINS, THESE ARE PRETTY COMMON ONES I SEE IN PLACES.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE IN FLIPKART AND THE SERVICE. I WOULDN'T MIND PAYING 18K BECAUSE IT IS WORTH IT.
      
      
      WORD OF ADVICE-----------&GT;&GT; DON'T GO BY LOW PRICES. GO BY THE QUALITY OF SERVICE DONE, IT ALWAYS HELPS."
HTC One V T320,5,"THIS IS AMEZING PHONE,I FEEL BECOUSE,AM ALREADY USE SAMSUNG,NOKIA,LG,SONYERICSON,AND LOT OF SMART PHONE BUT FIRST TIME I TRY HTC SMART PHONE REALLY, HTC IS GREAT FEUITURE IN INDIAN MARKET.ALL THE BEST HTC........"
HTC One V T320,5,"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST CELL PHONE IN THE MID-RANGE SMARTPHONE SECTION. I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY OTHER PHONE GIVING IT A STIFF COMPETITION. PERHAPS THE SONY ERICSSON EXPERIA NEO COMES A LITTLE CLOSE BUT REALLY, WHO AM I KIDDING??? THIS IS HEADS AND SHOULDERS ABOVE ITS COMPETITORS! IT DEFINITELY ISN'T ONE OF THOSE PHONES THAT PROMISES MORE THAN WHAT IT DELIVERS. IT'S ACTUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND WITH THIS BEAUTY. SO, WITHOUT WASTING MUCH TIME AT ALL, ALLOW ME TO JOT DOWN WHAT AS PER MY EXPERIENCE, SEEM TO BE THE HTC ONE V'S PROS AND CONS....
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. BEATS AUDIO! UNBELIEVABLE MUSIC QUALITY! IN LOVE WITH IT!
      
      2.CRISP DISPLAY AND A VERY SMOOTH TOUCHSCREEN.
      
      3. VERY COMFORTABLE IN THE HAND. FITS RATHER NICELY INTO THE PALM. VERY SMART DESIGN.
      
      4. ICS 4.0! ONE OF THE VERY FIRST FEW PHONES WITH ANDROID 4.0!
      
      5. THE CAMERA IS UNEXPECTEDLY BRILLIANT.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. EFFECTS-HEAVY GAMES CAN AT TIMES LAG A LITTLE. A GAME LIKE TEMPLE RUN FUNCTIONS PRETTY SMOOTHLY THOUGH. THIS IS SUBJECTIVE.
      
      2. NO FRONT/SECONDARY CAMERA. THIS IS THE ONLY FEATURE THAT HTC MAY HAVE MISSED THE MARK WITH.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, HTC HAS COMPLETELY REDEFINED THE PHRASE ""VALUE FOR MONEY"" WITH ITS ONE V. THIS IS WELL AND TRULY A FANTASTIC DEAL.
      
      
      P.S. FLIPKART'S SERVICE WAS ONCE AGAIN SPOT ON! CHEERS!"
HTC One V T320,5,"THIS IS SERIOUSLY, *ONE* SPECIAL PHONE !! THIS IS THE BEST YOU CAN GET AT THIS PRICE RANGE !!
      
      HTC HAS CREATED A MARVEL FOR USERS WHO WANT A GOOD PHONE AT A DECENT PRICE..
      
      SERIOUSLY HAS AN AMAZING CAMERA ... OR EVEN MORE THAN THAT :D
      
      AMAZING SOUND ?? YES FOR SURE !! BEATS DONT MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BUT STILL THE SOUND IS BETTER THAN OF ANY PHONE IN THIS RANGE!
      
      LOOKING FOR A PHONE IN UNDER 20K ?? DON'T WASTE A SECOND.. THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED!!! :D"
HTC One V T320,5,"THIS PHONE IS REALLY GOOD BELIEVE ME.I BROUGHT THIS PHONE 5 DAYS AGO. IT IS THE LATEST PHONE BY HTC AND OF COURSE RUNS ON ANDROID V.4(ICE CREAM SANDWICH). THIS PHONE HAS A VERY UNIQUE CAMERA AND HAS GOT MANY CAMERA FEATURES. THIS PHONE REALLY IMPRESSED ME.
      
      
      IT THE MOST AMAZING PHONE FOR MUSIC LOVERS AS IT HAS MANY COOL MUSIC SETTINGS. TALKING ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE CAMERA ON THIS PHONE, IT HAS GOT A 5 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA WITH HD RECORDING. MOST UNIQUE FEATURE IN ITS VIDEO RECORDING IS YOU CAN SNAP PHOTOS WHEN YOU ARE RECORDING! ITS CAMERA WORKS VERY FAST. JUST CLICK THE BUTTON AND WITHIN NO TIME YOU GET A PHOTO IN HD CLARITY.
      
      
      IT HAS GOT SMOOTH CAPACITIVE TOUCHSCREEN IN WHICH YOU CAN ENJOY TOUCH EXPERIENCE. TALKING ABOUT THE WEB BROWSER ON THIS PHONE, IT IS VERY FAST AND SMOOTH. BELIEVE ME YOU WILL NOT FIND AND PROBLEMS ON THIS PHONE REGARDING BROWSING EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      GAMING TOO IS FUN ON THIS PHONE AS IT SUPPORTS HD GAMING. SUPERB GRAPHICS AND EASY TO USE.
      
      
      OVERALL GUYS I WILL GIVE A FULL 5 OUT OF 5 FOR THIS PHONE. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.
      
      
      SO THE ALL NEW HTC ONE V
      
      AMAZING CAMERA
      
      CRYSTAL CLEAR SOUND"
HTC One V T320,5,"THIS REVIEW IS ONLY MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO MOD THEIR PHONE AND HAVE JELLY BEAN.  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT ONE V IS THAT IT HAS A HUGE DEVELOPER SUPPORT ON XDA WHICH NO PHONE BELOW 22K HAS. IT HAS EVEN ANDROID 4.1.2 AND COMING 4.2.1 [CM10 AND CM10.1]
      
      SO IF YOU'D LIKE THE LATEST VERSION OF ANDROID BLESSED BY A HUGE DEVELOPER SUPPORT BUY THIS PHONE. :)"
HTC One V T320,5,"THOUGH I HAVE USED ALL THE MOBILES IN THIS CATEGORY I STRONGLY FEEL THIS ONE IS THE BEST I EVER GOT MY HANDS ON. LONG STORY SHORT JUST BUY THIS MONSTER AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
      
      
      PROS: 1. AWESOME SCREEN AND BUILT QUALITY.
      
      2. ICS
      
      3. HTC SENSE.
      
      4. GOOD SOUND QUALITY WITH APP POWERAMP
      
      5. GOOD BATTERY LIFE. 28 HOURS(NORMAL USE)
      
      
      CONS: 1. PLAYIN HEAVY GRAPHIC GAMES AND TRYING TO JUMP TO ANOTHER APPLICATION IS NOT AS SMOOTH AS I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE.
      
      2. IN CALL VOLUME IS A LITTLE LOW, I GUESS THATS WITH ALL HTC MOBILES.
      
      
      AL IN ALL CONS CAN BE LOOKED OVER AS THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE IS JUST MIND BLOWING."
HTC One V T320,5,"WELL IT HAS BEEN 3 DAYS...AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE EXCELLENT. THE CAMERA IS JUST FANTASTIC BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT GOOD IN LOW LIGHT. YOU GET PANORAMA HDR AND LOTS MORE...BEATS AUDIO IS OK AS WELL. THE BUILD QUALITY IS EXCELLENT AND DISPLAY IS TRULY AMAZING. THE HEADPHONES ARE GOOD. THE PHONE IS QUITE SMOOTH BUT IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF JUNK IN YOUR PHONE THEN OBVIOUSLY IT WILL SLOW DOWN. THE BIGGEST MISS IS HOWEVER THE COMPASS. NAVIGATION ISNT A PROBLEM BUT GOOGLE SKY WILL NOT WORK AS WELL. BUT AGAIN BATTERY IS GREAT AT 1500MAH. SO FAR SO GOOD, HAV READ A LOT OF COMMENTS SAYING IT GOES DEAD, WELL NOTHING SO FAR (HOPE IT DOES NOT HAPPEN :) )"
HTC One V T320,5,"WELL WELL WELL......I M BEING USNG THIS PRODUCT FOR AROUND A WEEK.....FIRSTLY WHN I SAW THIS PHONE, I WAS PRETTY AMAZED. IT WAS BIG,SLIM(VERY SLIM),GLOSSY AND ITS CUTE CHIN LOOKED VERY NICE NT WEIRD. BEHIND THE CHIN IS THE ""BEATS AUDIO""- A SYSTEM BY HTC FOR A BETTER SOUND EXPERIENCE WHICH DEFINATELY WORKS. THEN IS THE SCREEN WHICH IS BIG, SMOOTH AND VERY SENSITIVE, IT HAS ANDROID 4.0.3 USER INTERFERANCE NT JST ONLY 4.0 (ONLY FEW PEOPLE KNW THIS)WHICH HAS MANY BUG FIXES PLUS NEW FEATURES, THATS WHY ITS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER 4.0 DEVICE. WELL,PLAY STORE HAS MANY SUPER COOL APPS + GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN 1, TEMPLE RUN 2, SUBWAY SURFERS ETC. WHICH WRKS ONLY WELL WHN LESS APPS R WRKING ON UR PHONE..THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN USING ANDROID EARLIER MST BE KNWING ABT RAM BOOSTER AND TASK KILLER AVALIABLE AT PLAY STORE WHICH IZ REQUIRED  BEFORE PLAYING ANY GAME FOR ITS SMOOTH FUNCTION. MANY RAM BOOSTERS,ANDROID BOOSTERS ARE AVALIABLE ON ANDROID MARKET TO BOOST UP UR PHONE AND UR GAMES AND APPS IN IT( AFTER THS GAMES WRK PERFECTLY FINE). CAMERA IS VERY NICE BETTER THAN NOKIA LUMIA 620,GALAXY ACE,GALAXY Y,GALXY S AND SONY TIPO {AFTER PERSONALLY USING ALL THE MENTIONED PHONES HTC IZ THE BEST}...ITS CAMERA HAS MANY IN-BUILT FEATURES WHCH R NT USALLY PRESENT.!! IT ALSO HAS HTC SENSE 4.0 WHICH IZ EQUAL TO ANDROID + ANDROID...DOUBLE ANDROID
      
      
      OVER ALL A GR8 PHONE WITH GR8 APPS AND GR8 CAMERA ND WITH GR8 PRICE..... ONLY REQUIRES RAM BOOSTERS AND TASK KILLER APPS AVALIABLE AT PLAY STORE!!!"
HTC One V T320,5,"WHEN IT COMES TO DESIGN ITS OUTSTANDING, THE UNI ALUMINIUM BODY FEELS GREAT TO HANDLE, NOT TO FORGOT THE CHIN UP .THE SCREEN QUALITY IS JUST AMAZING NO OTHER PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE RANGE COMES CLOSER TO HTC ONE V! ITS A GOOD DEAL WHEN YOU MAKE IT BELOW 18K."
HTC One V T320,5,"YES IT IS AWESOME....FOR NON TECHNICAL PEOPLES IT MAY BE BAD COZ THEY DONT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE AN ANDROID PHONE...THERE R SUCH PEOPLES WHO THINK THAT IT IS A PRODUCT WITH A LOW PROCESSING SPEED FRM HTC BUT ACTUALLY IT HAPPENS DUE TO SOME KIND OF APPS LIKE JUNK....WHEN WE INSTALL SOME OF THEM THE PHN GOES SLOW BUT OVERALL AFTER UNINSTALLING THEM IT WORKS GREAT....
      
      
      AMEZING CAMERA: VERY QUICKLY CAPTURABLE , MANY INBUILT FEATURES AND EDITING LIKE PHOTOSHOP
      
      
      AUTHANTIC SOUND: BEATS AUDIO.WOW IT IS REALLY LOVLY
      
      
      HTC SENSE 4.0 GIVES A VERY RICH ANDROID EXPERIENCE, DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE THOUGHT BAD ABOUT THIS PHONE ..ANYWAY I THINK IF U WANT A FULLY FEATURED ANDROID DEVICE WITH LOVABLE COUSTOMIZATION THEN GO FOR HTC...IT IS BEST UPTO...USING IT SINCE 3 MONTHS ,...HAVING NO PROBLEM...LOVE THIS PHONE...AND  THE DESIGN OF THIS PHONE....UNBEATABLE IN ANYAY...THUMBS UP
      
      
      ONE WORD....BUY IT .....LOVELY PRODUCT IT IS....!"
HTC One V T320,4,A GOOD PHONE.BOUGHT IT A WEEK AGO.HAVE A HEATING PROBLEM BUT YOU DOES NOT NEED TO BOTHER.A GREAT CHOICE BECAUSE OF ITS ANDROID 4.0 AND HTC SENSE.GREAT CAMERA AND BEATS AUDIO ARE GREAT BUT I AM MISSING BEATS HEADPHONE AS GIVEN WITH ONE A AND X.THE BROWSER NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.THE PRODUCT SAYS 4GB INTERNAL MEMORY BUT THE PHONE IS SHOWING 1GB SO I AM LOOKING AT THE CAUSE.
HTC One V T320,4,"AS SAID BY HTC ITS CAMERA IS DAMN GUD N THERE IS BEATS AUDIO OF COURSE
      
      SO MUSIC OUTPUT IS JUST EXCELLENT
      
      
      PROS:

      &GT;&GT;UI:D UI IS HTC SENSE 4  SO ITS VERY GUD
      
      
      CONS:
      
      &GT;&GT; RAM ONLY 390 MB SO SUMTIMES GETS LAGGY
      
      &GT;&GT;GAMING: SOME GAMES LYK ANGRY BIRDS PLAY WELL

      WHICH IS NOT DAT GUD
      
      
      FINALLY , IF U R NOT CONCERNED ABOUT GAMING DAT MUCH U CAN JUST GO FOR THIS PHONE"
HTC One V T320,4,"AT LAST I GOT MY HTC ONE V, ITS JUST AMAZING.....ITS WORTH FOR ITS PRICE, JUST GO WITH IT. ONLY THE CONS IS SECONDARY CAMERA NOT AVAILABLE, BUT ITS NOT A MATTER.... WONDER FULL CAMERA AND STUNNING SOUND EFFECT."
HTC One V T320,4,"AWESOME PHONE WITH BEST PRICE.
      
      1. ICS - ANDROID 4.0.3 ICE CREAM SANDWITCH
      
      2. CAMERA FEATURE- EXTREMELY EFFICIENT CAMERA WITH A DEDICATED IMAGE CHIP ,CAN TAKE PHOTOS AT 4 FRAMES PER SECOND ,
      
      BEATS AUDIO
      
      I FELT IT GOOD TO HAVE IT"
HTC One V T320,4,"BOUGHT THIS BEAUTIFUL CELL FROM FLIPKART. NO NEED TO PRAISE FLIPKART, EVERYONE KNOWS IT IS BEST IN DELIVERY.
      
      ABOUT THE PHONE, ITS BEEN TWO WEEKS NOW AND I M LOVING IT MORE THAN ANYTHING. BEAUTIFUL LOOKS, CRISP AND CLEAR SCREEN MAKE IT WORTH A BUY. IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, YOU GET WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM A 1GHZ PROCESSOR. A BIT COSTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE FEATURES IT OFFERS, BUT IT REALLY STANDS OUT IN A SAMSUNG CROWDED CANDY BAR WORLD.
      
      GREAT BATTERY LIFE, SMOOTH UI, GREAT CAMERA (ANY DAY BETTER FROM SAMSUNG),1GB INTERNAL MEMORY WHICH IS ENOUGH AND AROUND 360 MB USABLE RAM.
      
      IN ALL A GREAT PACKAGE...
      
      I HOPE IT WORKS AS SMOOTH AS IT WORKS NOW AFTER FEW MONTHS ALSO.
      
      IF DESIGN, LOOKS, CAMERA AND SCREEN RESOLUTION ARE THE THINGS YO ARE LOOKING FOR THEN GO FOR THIS CLASSY ONE. IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
      
      BUT IF PERFORMANCE, VIDEO CALLING, INTENSE GAMING ARE YOUR NECESSITIES THEN GO FOR SONY OR SAMSUNG..
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT ----
      
      
      GO FOR IT GUYS..
      
      IF U WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT.IT REALLY FEELS LIKE A PREMIUM CELL WITH GREAT LOOKS AND CAMERA
      
      
      OR...
      
      GO FOR SONY OR SAMSUNG"
HTC One V T320,4,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AND THEIR SERVICE AS USUAL GOOD. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR MORE THAN 2 MONTHS. MY USER EXPERIENCE WITH THE PHONES ARE LIKE
      
      
      MOTOROLA DEFY PLUS
      
      NOKIA N8
      
      BLACKBERRY 9320
      
      HTC ONE V
      
      
      FOLLOWING ARE THE POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO SUMMARIZE BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      
      GOODS:
      
      
      SCREEN IS SO GOOD AND NAVIGATION IS ALSO GOOD.
      
      
      SLIM AND NICE TO HOLD.
      
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD (AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED).
      
      
      NOT SO GOODS:
      
      
      BATTERY DESPITE BEING 1500 MAH LASTS ONLY FOR A DAY WITH 3G KEPT ON AND WITH MILD USAGE.
      
      IF YOU DISABLE 3G AND TURN OFF ALL THE SMART PHONE FEATURES IT WILL LAST FOR 2 DAYS OR MORE, BUT THIS DEFEATS THE VERY PURPOSE LIKE BUYING A SMART PHONE AND DISABLING ALL THE SMART FEATURES. IF YOU ARE A GAMER THEN THE BATTERY LASTS FOR 4 HRS OR SO. I AM A FREQUENT TEMPLE RUN AND ANGRY BIRDS PLAYER.
      
      
      CALL QUALITY IS AVERAGE BUT THIS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF A PHONE.
      
      
      MUSIC QUALITY AVERAGE.
      
      
      NO JELLY BEAN UPDATE AS THE RAM IS ONLY 512 MB.
      
      
      IF YOU INSTALL CRAP A LOAD OF APPS IN THE PHONE THEN I AM SURE YOU WILL COMPLAIN THAT IT HANGS A LOT.
      
      
      CONCLUSION:
      
      
      I DONT WANT TO COMPARE THIS PHONE WITH ANY OF THE PHONE I HAVE USED PREVIOUSLY. THIS PHONE IS NOT SUITED FOR GAMERS AND FOR THE ONE WHO MAKES A LOT OF CALLS.
      
      
      AVERAGE IS THE ONLY WORD I WOULD LIKE TO USE."
HTC One V T320,4,"GOT FROM THE LOCAL STORE (MYSORE) FOR A THOUSAND LESS THAN FLIPKART PRICE...
      
      
      MY EXPERIENCE:
      
      DISPLAY IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING...BEST IN CLASS WITH GLASS LAMINATION, THE VIEWING ANGLES ARE GREAT AND WATCHING VIDEOS IS AWESOME.
      
      THE CAMERA BLAZES, BUT HTC ARE NOT KNOWN FOR THE COLOR REPRODUCTION. BUT PHOTOS ARE CLEAR WELL RESOLVED AND 9 TIMES OUT OF TEN YOU GET THAT SHOT YOU WANTED.
      
      VIDEO RECORDING IS OK.
      
      
      VIDEO PLAYBACK IS AWESOME, THE FRAME RATES ARE SUPERB AND THE PHONE NEVER EVER STUTTERS EVEN AT 720P (BIG THING FOR A SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR)
      
      
      SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD, DEEP AND WARM- JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT (YOUD BE AMAZED IF ID TELL YOU THAT THE STOCK EARPHONES ARE QUITE GOOD)
      
      
      APPS- THESE THINGS CAUSE PHONES TO CRASH, FOR ME TEMPLE RUN AND CALENDER WERE THE BIGGEST CULPRITS
      
      
      THE FEEL- I FEEL GREAT HOLDING MY V, THE ALUMINIUM GIVES THE FEEL NO POLYCARBONATE CAN EVER GIVE...AWESOME BUILD QUALITY
      
      
      CONCERNS: THE ANTENNA IS BUILT INTO THE BACK COVER, SO DONT EVER LOSE IT. THE STOCK BROWSER ISNT SO GOOD, BE BETTER OFF DOWNLOADING FIREFOX/CHROME.
      
      
      VERDICT: LIKE ME IF YOU WERE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN DESIRE V, XPERIA U, NEO V AND SOLA...JUST GO FOR THIS PHONE...IF YOU HAVE A GOOD BUDGET GO FOR XPERIA P"
HTC One V T320,4,"GUYS I AM USING THIS PHONE SINCE ONE WEEK....I HAVE INSTALLED MOST OF THE APPS....AND THERE IS NO LAG OR SOME THING LIKE THAT I NOTICED....ITS ONE AWESOME PHONE TO USE....
      
      DONT EVER THINK TWICE TO BUY THIS PHONE....YOU WILL JUST LOVE IT ONCE THIS PHONE IS IN YOUR HAND....CHEERS...."
HTC One V T320,4,"HI GUYS,
      
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT HTC ONE V IN  NOVEMBER 2012. THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW ABOUT A PHONE WHICH I HAVE USED TILL NOW. SO LET ME TELL U THE TRUTH ALL ABOUT THIS SMART SLOW MOBILE. SINCE IT HAS JUST A 1GHZ PROCESSOR WHICH IS A BIT SLOW. CAMERA 5 MP WHICH IS AWESOME. HD RECORDINGS ARE VERY GOOD WITH THIS MOBILE. IT COME WITH ANDROID 4.0 ICECREAM SANDWITCH VERSION WHICH IS A VERY GUD AND LATEST IN THE ANDROID MARKET. 3.7 INCH OF DISPLAY SCREEN WHICH IS VERY DESCENT. IT HAS BEATS AUDIO AND I HAVE TO SHOW MY THUMB UP FOR THIS BECAUSE ITS JUS HAVE THE THEATRE EFFECT IN MUSIC AND AS WELL AS WHEN U WATCH ANY MOVIES. BATTERY BACK UP IS VERY GUD. COMES 1 AND A HALF DAY IF U ARE JUS CALLING AND IF U ARE USING IT WITH INTERNET AND CALLS AND MUSIC AND GAMES THEN IT COMES FOR 1 FULL DAY. VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND HAVE A NORMAL LOOK. FINALLY I WANT TO SAY EXCEPT FOR SLOW PROCESSOR EVERYTHING IS VERY FINE AND WE CAN HAVE A THUMBS UP FOR THIS PRODUCT."
HTC One V T320,4,"HI GUYS...I JUST PURCHASED THIS PHONE BEFORE 5 DAYS AND IFOUND GR8 CAR SOFTWARE MODE WHICH IS GR8 FOR GPS..YOU HAVE TO DOWNALOAD MAP OF INDIA AND IT JUST NAVIGATE YOU ACCURATELY WITH VOICE GUIDE SYSTEM. HERE I LIKE TO FOCUS THIS POINT BECAUSE I DIDNT EXPACT THIS GR8 FACILITY INSIDE...
      
      ...JUST GO IT..ITS GR8 PHONE BETTER THAN SAMSUNG"
HTC One V T320,4,"HI PURCHASED THIS PHONE A WEEK AGO, ITS BRILLIANT ! BUT CHARGES ARE LITTLE OVER ACCORDING TO ME, 1GHZ PROCESSOR, 512MB RAM WORKS WELL, THERE ARE FEW LAGGING WHILE BROWSING FLASH SITE OR VIDEO, ICE CREAM SANDWICH IS GREAT EXPERIENCE. CAMERA IS BETTER.
      
      
      HTC SHOULD INCLUDE FRONT CAM, HDMI OPTION, VOICE QUALITY IS JUST AVERAGE, VOLUME RANGE SHOULD HAVE MORE.
      
      
      OVERALL ITS A GOOD BUY."
HTC One V T320,4,"HTC HAS CERTAINLY PROVIDED THE MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK (HIGH QUALITY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE) AT A REASONABLE RATE.
      
      FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DISAPPOINTED BY HIGHER PRICE AND BLAMING HTC, GUYS PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT HTC WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR PHONES ON FLIPKART.  HTC WILL ONLY GET A FIXED AMOUNT FOR EVERY HANDSET SOLD IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE YOU BUY FROM.
      
      
      IN FACT IT IS UPTO THE RETAILER , HOW MUCH MARKUP IS KEPT ON THE BASE PRICE, HIGHER MARKUP MEANS HIGHER MARGINS FOR THE RETAILER, HTC IS BOUND TO PROVIDE THE SAME SLAS AND SERVICE TO A BUYER."
HTC One V T320,4,"HTC SENSE SUCKS.. IT JUST HANGS ESPECIALLY ON THIS DEVICE..
      
      INSTALL JELLYBEAN CYNOGENMOD CUSTOM ROM AND THE PHONE IS AWESOME..
      
      WITH DEFAUL ROM I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT EVEN USABLE FOR DAILY TASKS.. IT JUST BLOODY HANGS.. WITHOUT HTC SENSE (I.E. WITH CYNOGENMOD ) IT ROCKS.."

HTC One V T320,4,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST 15 DAYS ,ITS VERY GOOD; PROS ARE GOOD TOUCHSCREEN ,VERY LIGHT N SLIM ,CAMERA IS ALSO VERY GOOD .BATTERY IS AVERAGE AS IT GIVES ME 1 FULL DAY ,CONS ARE GETS HOT WHILE PLAYING GAMES BUT AS WE PLAY IN ALL HANDSETS IT GETS HOT ,SO I WOULD SUGGEST TO BUY THIS FOR ITS SLEEK DESIGN ,ICS,CAMERA"
HTC One V T320,4,I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST 3 WEEKS AND I LOVE THIS ONE. IT HAS REALLY WORTH FEATURES AND I ALSO GOT 8GB MEMORY CARD FREE. ONE THING DON'T INSTALL TOO MANY APPLICATIONS COS YOU WILL FEEL BIT SLOW. THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR IN TIME DELIVERY. I RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.
HTC One V T320,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART 10 DAYS BACK. I AM A FIRST TIME ANDROID AND SMART PHONE USER. SO THIS PHONE IS DEFINITE MOVE UP FOR ME. THE SCREEN AND COLORS ARE GREAT AND SO IS THE SOUND. VIDEOS PLAY WELL. THE BROWSER ISNT HALF AS BAD AS SOME REVIEWS MENTION. THE BUNDLED EARPHONES ARENT GREAT BUT I USE MY IPOD EARPHONES AND BEAT AUDIO WORKS GREAT, BETTER THAN IPOD. THE HTC SENSE UI WORKS WELL AND AGAIN TAKING IPHONE 4 AS THE BENCHMARK, IT COME UP BETTER. HTC INCLUDES A 8 GB SD CARD WITH THE BOX.
      
      
      ONLY LOW POINT IS THE SPEED. I WAS EXPECTING FASTER PERFORMANCE GIVEN THAT THE ONE V HAS A 1GHZ ENGINE UNDER THE HOOD. BUT IT IS A TAD SLOW. SWITCHING BETWEEN APPS, OR CLOSING ONE AND HEADING FOR THE HOME SCREEN BRINGS UP THE 'LOADING' SIGN VERY FREQUENTLY, ALTHOUGH ONLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO. ANOTHER AREA OF IMPROVEMENT IS THE MUSIC SPEAKER VOLUME. THOUGH I UNDERSTAND HTC WENT FOR QUALITY AND NOT QUANTITY HENCE THE BEATS AUDIO. A LITTLE HIGHER SPEAKER VOLUME WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE MUSIC TO BE PLAYED ON ITS OWN IN A ROOM INSTEAD OF PLUGGING IN THE SPEAKERS.
      
      
      SO IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH A LITTLE LAGGING CPU AND A NOT SO GREAT SPEAKER VOLUME, THIS PHONE IS AN AWESOME BUY."
HTC One V T320,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 17TH JUNE. FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS IT WORKED LIKE A DREAM. THEN ON 1ST JULY, THE PHONE JUST DIED. JUST WOULDN'T BOOT. I WENT TO THE HTC SERVICE CENTER IN PUNE AND SHOWED IT. THEY SAID THE PHONE WOULD BE REPLACED AS IT GOT SPOILT WITHIN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS. AND IT DID. SO I'M EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH HTC'S AFTER-SALES SERVICE. THOUGH THERE WAS A SIMILAR PROBLEM IN ANOTHER ONE V ON THE SAME DAY AND THEY SAID IT WOULD TAKE ATLEAST A MONTH TO GET THE PARTS REPLACED.
      
      I WOULD STILL RATE THIS PHONE HIGH BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY GOOD ANDROID PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE. GOOD LOOKS, AWESOME CAMERA, FAST PROCESSOR AND ICS 4.0 MAKES IT A GOOD BUY. THE BATTERY EASILY LASTS FOR A DAY AND NEARLY 1.5 DAYS IF YOUR DATA USAGE IS NOT TOO HEAVY. THE ADDED FEATURE OF USING IT AS A WI-FI HOTSPOT IS AN ADDED ADVANTAGE.
      
      WOULD RECOMMEND A BUY!"
HTC One V T320,4,"I DIDN'T BUY THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART, BUT I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST TWO MONTHS, IT WAS THE BEST PHONE IN 17-20K RANGE AT THAT TIME..
      
      *PROS
      
      -DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY IS STANDARD..AFTER ALL IT'S OF HTC ONE SERIES..
      
      -SCREEN RESOLUTION AND DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD..

HTC One V T320,4,"I HAD MADE A PURCHASE FOR THIS PHONE ON 1ST JUNE (FRIDAY) AND IT WAS DELIVERED TO ME ON 4TH JUNE (MONDAY). AFTER A DAY'S USAGE, THE PHONE BRICKED OUT (NOT CHARGING/SWITCHING-ON) ON 5TH JUNE. I UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ALL MANUFACTURING PROCESSES ARE 100% PERFECT, AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT FLIP KART AND HTC CORP. EMPATHISE WITH THIS SITUATION. I'M NOW RETURNING THE PHONE FOR REPLACEMENT AND SINCE IT IS CURRENTLY LISTED AS ""OUT OF STOCK"", I'M GUESSING THE BATCH OF PHONES WITH MANUFACTURING DEFECTS ARE NOW BEING REPLACED ENTIRELY.
      
      
      FOR THE ONE DAY OF USAGE, THE PHONE HAS SHOWN ITS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR PERFORMANCE THAT IS UNMATCHED WITH OTHER PHONES IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE. SOME MIGHT WONDER WHY I'M STILL CRAVING (FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD) FOR THIS PHONE, THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH IT. WELL, FOR STARTERS, THIS COMES WITH THE ICE CREAM SANDWICH PRE-LOADED, SO THAT WOULD MEAN OFFICIALLY UPGRADING TO JELLY BEAN AND WHATEVER IS PLANNED FOR LATER WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM. SECOND, HTC SENSE 4. YEARS AGO, IPHONE SET A BENCHMARK IN UI DESIGN AND USER-FRIENDLINESS, AND NOW WITH SENSE 4, HTC IS SETTING A BENCHMARK SO HIGH, THAT ALL THE OTHER MANUFACTURERS/DEVELOPERS HAVE FALLEN BEHIND.
      
      
      I'M EAGERLY WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENT (HOPEFULLY WITHOUT FURTHER MANUFACTURING GLITCHES) AND WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK FLIP KART FOR THEIR DEDICATED SERVICE."
HTC One V T320,4,"I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A SAMSUNG FAN AND AFTER GIVING A LOT OF THOUGHTS AND GOING THROUGH VARIOUS VIDEOS AND REVIEWS THOUGHT OF TRYING MY HANDS ON HTC.
      
      GOT THE HTC ONE V 2 DAYS BACK AND  I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE. THE BATTERY IS SUPERB. THE DISPLAY IS QUITE GOOD AS WELL. HTC COULD HAVE DONE WITH THE LITTLE MORE OF INTERNAL MEMORY.
      
      
      THE CAMERA OF THE PHONE IS TOO GOOD AND CAPTURE IMAGES AS GOOD AS ANY 8 MEGA PIXEL CAMERA PHONE.
      
      
      THE DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY IS PERFECT AND THE PHONE LOOKS QUITE GOOD IN YOUR HANDS.
      
      THE BEATS ENABLED FEATURE JUST ENHANCES THE MUSIC EXPERIENCE.
      
      ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY YOU SPEND ON THIS PHONE."
HTC One V T320,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THE PHONE SINCE PAST TWO WEEKS AND THIS REVIEW IS MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH THE PHONE.I AM NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN ANY TECHNICAL DETAIL ON THIS BUT WILL ONLY TELL YOU THE ACTUAL USAGE FUNCTIONS OF THE PHONE.
      
      
      DISPLAY: THE 3.7 INCH SCREEN IS HUGE AND IS BRIGHT,CLEAR AND CRISP.IT DOESN'T PIXELATE AND WATCHING VIDEOS AND PLAYING GAMES IS ENJOYABLE.THE TOUCH IS BRILLIANT AND IS ANYTIME BETTER THAN ANY SAMSUNG PHONE OR ANY OTHER COMPETITOR.
      
      
      SOUND: THE BEATS AUDIO ENHANCEMENT IS AN ADDON WHILE PLAYING MUSIC OR WATCHING VIDEOS, BUT THE ORIGINAL HEADSET DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A GOOD OPTION TO ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE.
      
      RATHER PREFER THE MONSTER IBEATS ALONG WITH THE PHONE.THE OVERALL SOUND CLARITY IS GOOD ENOUGH.
      
      
      CAMERA: I GOT DISAPPOINTED HERE...!!!..I WISH HTC WOULD HAVE WORKED A BIT MORE ON THE LENS PART.THE 5 MGPXL CAMERA COMES WITH A LED FLASH,BUT THE IMAGES PIXELATE WHEN ZOOMED IN.IF YOU DONT USE CAMERA A LOT AND WANT TO COMPROMISE ON THIS THEN THE PHONE IS AWESOME IN ITSELF.ALSO THE SECONDARY CAMERA IS NOT PROVIDED,SO FOR ALL THOSE WHO WANT THE VIDEO CALLING OPTION, THIS ONE IS NOT FOR YOU.
      
      
      MEMORY: THE COMPANY SAYS THE PHONE HAS GOT 4GB INTERNAL MEMORY, BUT THE USER ONLY GETS 1GB USAGE.ALSO ANOTHER DISAPPOINTING THING IS THAT WHEN I TRIED SENDING A 200MB VIDEO FROM MY TABLET IT COULDN'T GET SAVED IN THE PHONE.THEN I REALIZED THAT, THE 1GB USER MEMORY IS ONLY FOR THE APPS THAT YOU DOWNLOAD ON THE PHONE.OTHER FILES GET SAVED IN THE PHONE'S INTERNAL MEMORY WHICH IS ONLY 100MB, SO YOU CANNOT RECEIVE BULKY FILES FROM OTHER BLUETOOTH HANDSETS.HOWEVER, YOU CAN STILL SAVE BULKY FILES TO YOUR MEMORY CARD BY CONNECTING YOUR PHONE TO A COMPUTER TO USING A MEMORY CARD READER.
      
      
      BATTERY: THE PHONE HAS AN INBUILT BATTERY WHICH MANY MAY NOT LIKE BUT THAT IS NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM THOUGH UNLESS YOU DONT END UP IN SHORT CIRCUITING YOUR HANDSET (RARE CASES).THE OVERALL BATTERY USAGE IS MEDIOCRE.IT LASTS FOR ABOUT 4-4.5 HOURS ON A FULL CHARGE (IF YOU ARE PLAYING MUSIC/VIDOES,PLAYING GAMES,SURFING THE INTERNET ALL AT ONCE).BETTER KEEP YOUR TRAVEL CHARGER WHILE ON THE GO.
      
      
      CALLS AND TEXTS: MANY SAY THAT HTC PHONES DOESN'T PROVIDE GOOD NETWORK CAPABILITIES.WELL I NEVER THOUGHT SO.TILL NOW I HAVEN'T GOT ANY CALL DROPS.THE CALL CLARITY IS GOOD ENOUGH.THE TEXT THREADS ARE ALSO BRILLIANT AND THE PREDICTIVE DICTIONARY IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR YOU TO NOT MAKE SPELLING MISTAKES WHILE TYPING MESSAGES OR EMAILS.
      
      
      WIFI AND INTERNET: THE REGULAR 2G (WAP/GPRS) CONNECTION ON YOUR PHONE IS NOT A GOOD OPTION IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUOSLY DOWNLOAD STUFF TO YOUR PHONE BECAUSE ITS VERY SLOW.HOWEVER WHEN I USED THE 3G AND THE WIFI,I GOT IMPRESSED.THE BROWSER IS BRILLIANT AND SURFING IS A WORTHWILE FEATURE ON THE PHONE.I DOWNLOADED AROUND 20 APPS (10MB-122MB SIZED) FROM THE APP STORE IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR.
      
      
      GAMING: HTC WINS HERE...!!!..INSPITE OF THE PHONE HAVING AN OUTDATED 1GHZ PROCESSOR,IT MAKES WONDERS ON THE GAMING PART.IT HAS THE ADRENO 205 GPU WHICH IS A LITTLE OUTDATED BUT IT WORKS AWESOME ON THIS PHONE.I COULD PLAY GRAPHIC INTENSE GAMES LIKE THE SHADOWGUN AND FRONTLINE COMMANDO WITH ANY HITCH AND LAGS.BASIC ANDROID GAMES LIKE ANGRY BIRDS AND OTHERS ARE JUNIORS FOR THIS PHONE.THE CLARITY IS SUPERB AND THE SOUNDS ARE ALSO BRILLIANT.
      
      
      MISCELLANEOUS: SOME OTHER USERS HAVE SAID THE PHONE GETS HEATED A LOT WHILE RUNNING HEAVY APPS AND GAMES OR ALSO WHILE MAKING CALLS.YES, I DO AGREE TO THIS FACT BUT THEN IT DOESN'T HEATS UP TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT WOULD BLAST IN YOUR HAND.HEATING UP OF THE PHONE IS PROBABLY BECAUSE THE PHONE HAS A METAL BODY AND AN INBUILT BATTERY.ALSO THE AMOUNT OF HEAT DEPENDS ON THE SURROUNDING TEMPERATURE.I USE THE PHONE IN AN AIR-CONDITIONED PLACE,I DID NOT FIND THE PHONE TO GET OVER HEATED.THE HTC SENSE 4.0 USER INTERFACE IS A BRILLIANT FEATURE OF THE PHONE.CHECK YOUTUBE FOR HTC SENSE 4.0 FOR MORE DETAILS.
      
      THE PHONE IS A MID-RANGE PHONE WITH SOME HIGH-RANGE FEATURES.I PERSONALLY FEEL IT IS WORTH BUYING AND I DID NOT MADE A MISTAKE BY CHOOSING THIS PHONE.
      
      SOME TIPS I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE IF ANYONE OF YOU IS INTERESTED IN BUYING THE PHONE :
      
      KEEP YOUR SCREEN BRIGHTNESS TO MEDIUM AS IT IS SUFFICIENT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO SEE WHATS HAPPENING ON THE SCREEN.
      
      DO NOT PLAY MUSIC ON FULL VOLUME, AS THIS PHONE BURTS OUT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC WITH BEATS AUDIO.
      
      DO NOT KEEP APPLICATIONS RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND AS IT WILL DRAIN YOUR BATTERY IMMENSELY.
      
      DO PURCHASE A SCRATCH GUARD (WILL COST YOU AROUND 400 RUPEES) FOR THE SCREEN ALONG WITH THE PHONE ITSELF, SO THAT YOU DO NOT DETEROIRATE THE SCREEN SOON."
HTC One V T320,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FONE SINCE LAST ALMOST 20 DAYS AND I M VERY MUCH IMPRESSED WITH IT.I HAD PURCHASED SAMSUNG GALAXY ACE 2 MONTHS BACK WHICH I SOLD AFTER USING FOR 1 MONTH BECAUSE THE BATTERY REALLY SCREWED ME.I HAD TO CARRY A CHARGER WITH ME AS THE BATTERY COULDNT WITHSTAND EVEN FOR A HALF DAY.BUT HTC ONE V BATTERY IS AWESOME IT STANDS MINIMUM FOR 1 AND HALF DAY AFTER UNLIMITED BROWSING.OTHER FEATURES ARE ALSO SUPERB..JZ LOVING IT.
      
      WHEN I PURCHASED IT THAT TIME COST WAS RS 17534 AND NOW ITS GONE UP TO 19300..LUCKY ME.
      
      REGARDING HTC SERVICE I MUST SAY THEY ARE THE BEST.MY FONE WAS GETTING HEATED UP AND I APPROACHED HTC ON THE TOLL FREE NUMBER MENTIONED ON THE BOX AND THEY REPLACED MY HANDSET WITHIN ONE DAY.NOW NO PROBLEM..M ENJOYING IT.THE HD CAMERA IS JZ SUPERBB.GUYZZ JZGO FOR IT..ITZ AN AWESOME FONE."
HTC One V T320,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR PAST 7-8 MONTHS AND BOUGHT IT AROUND 19K. I MUST SAY AFTER USING THIS PHONE, I BECAME A LOYAL TO HTC PRODUCTS (USED SAMSUNG PREDOMINANTLY BEFORE).
      
      THE PHONE HAS LOTS OF WONDERFUL AND USEFUL FEATURES AND DIDN'T COMPROMISED ON THE BASIC NEEDS OF A PHONE.
      
      THE PROS ARE -
      
      1. WONDERFUL BATTERY BACKUP... RUNS FOR 3 DAYS WITH MODERATE TALKTIME AND APP USAGE.
      
      2. CAMERA IS BEST IN CLASS...MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER 5MP PHONES. SHOOTS CONTINUOUSLY AND CAPTURES GOOD 720P VIDEO.
      
      3. SOUND QUALITY IS SUPERB. WITH THE BEATS SOUND, THE SONGS WITH EARPIECE SOUNDS BETTER THAN IPOD.
      
      4. SLIM, HOLDS VERY GOOD AND A VERY INNOVATIVE SHAPE(LIFT CHIN SHAPE).
      
      5. TOUCH IS VERY SMOOTH.
      
      6. PERFORMANCE IS GOOD AND AS EXPECTED FROM A 1 GHZ PROCESSOR. LAGS SOMETIMES WITH LOTS OF APPS INSTALLED. FAIR PERFORMANCE WITH MOST OF THE GAMES.
      
      7. WIFI CONNECTIVITY IS GOOD.
      
      
      CONS-
      
      1. AFTER SCRATCHING MY HEAD FOR SOMETIMES ON THIS, FOUND THIS - HAVE TO BE SATISFIED WITH ANDROID V4.0, NOT UPGRADABLE FOR JELLY BIN."
HTC One V T320,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE A WEEK BACK. CERTAINLY, IT IS THE BEST PHONE AVAILABLE AT 18K PRICE, PACKED WITH FEATURES, GREAT LOOK.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. IT IS BEAUTIFULLY CLAMSHELLED IN TOUGH METAL BODY. LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT! THE BODY SHAPE ENABLES YOU TO GRIP IT PROPERLY, EVEN IN CROWD.
      
      2. THE CAMERA IS VERY VERY FAST. SOMETIMES, YOU WON'T NOTICE THE SHUTTER SOUND AND THE PHOTO IS TAKEN. THE BEST SHOT FUNCTION IS HANDY FOR AMATEURS.
      
      3. BEATS AUDIO OFFERS UNBEATABLE SOUND QUALITY.
      
      4. INTERNET SURFING IS VERY EASY. ESPECIALLY WITH ADDED FEATURES BY HTC SENSE.
      
      5. THERE IS A VERY USEFUL FEATURE I NOTICED WHILE CALLING. THE BACKLIGHT GETS OFF WHILE YOU HOLD THE DEVICE BESIDES YOUR EAR. AND IT GETS IMMEDIATELY ON WHEN YOU TAKE IT APART FROM HEAD. ITS VERY HANDY TO CHECK THE CALL STATUS AND UNWANTED SCREEN TAPS DURING CALLS.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. IT LACKS FRONT CAMERA AND COMPASS.
      
      2. BATTERY LIFE IS NOT SATISFACTORY.
      
      3. THE BATTERY IS NOT REMOVABLE.
      
      
      ALL SAID AND DONE...VERY GOOD LOOKING PHONE AT BEST PRICE"
HTC One V T320,4,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS PHONE FEW DAYS BACK AND THIS PHONE IS AS SMOOTH AS BUTTER, BUT IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIME ANDROID USER THEN GO FOR A SAMSUNG . ANOTHER THING IS THE BEATS AUDIO QUALITY IS JUST AWESOME EVEN A POOR QUALITY SONG SEEMS THE BEST ONE. THE CAMERA IS DECENT.
      
      
      THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH SO SAMSUNG IS A CHEAPER OPTION!!"
HTC One V T320,4,"I JUST MOVED FROM MY LG OPTIMUS ANDROID PHONE TO THE NEW HTC AND THE UI INTERFACE IS JUST AMAZING. THE ICONS, RESOLUTION, SCREEN DISPLAY, TOUCH FEATURES, SOUND QUALITY IS JUST AMAZING. I WAS BORED WITH THE ANDROID 2.X VERSION AND WANTED A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. SO MY CHOICES WERE CLEAR - EITHER SAMSUNG OMNIA WINDOWS PHONE OR HTC ONE. CONSIDERING THE BASIC FEATURES MISSING IN OMNIA, I WENT IN FOR THIS ONE. SLEEK DESIGN, VERY LIGHT - A LITTLE TEDIOUS TO HANDLE, DOESN'T COME EASILY IN THE HAND.
      
      BUT THE ICE CREAM SANDWICH OS IS JUST AMAZING.
      
      
      CONS -
      
      1) ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY QUOTES 4GB INTERNAL SPACE, ONLY 1GB IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. LOOKS LIKE THE OS EATS UP THE 3GB STORAGE. VERY DISAPPOINTING. BUT I GOT 8 GB SD CARD FREE ON BUYING THIS PHONE.
      
      2) CAMERA PICTURES GIVES YELLOWISH TINGE ON USING FLASH.
      
      3) CANNOT ATTACH DOCUMENTS (ONLY PICS) WHEN SENDING MESSAGES USING GMAIL."
HTC One V T320,4,"I M USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST 2 MONTHS, ITS GOOD. NICE LOOK, EASY TO CARRY AND BATTERY BACKUP IS ALSO NICE. BUT I FACED 2 PROBLEM WITH IT, WHICH IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR ME. WHEN ME OR ANY ONE OF MY FRIENDS WANT TO PLAY ANY HIGH GRAPHIC GAME, ITS DELAY TO PROCESS AND NEED NEED TO RESTART IT AGAIN FOR NORMAL USE. I CHECKED NONE OF BACKGROUND PROCESS IS RUNNING EXCEPT THAT GAME. SECONDLY, CALL WAITING OPTION IS A VITAL THING WHICH OPTION IS NOT WORKING BUT IT HAS A OPTION TO ACTIVATE THE CALL WAITING. I FEEL DISGUST WHEN I SEE SOMEONE IS CALLING ME OVER N OVER WHEN HE SAW THE CALL IS WAITING, SAME AS ME OTHERS ALSO FEEL DISTURBED WHEN I DO THE SAME THING. ITS REALLY A PANIC. OTHERWISE ITS OKAY WITH ME, ITS SMART N GOOD."
HTC One V T320,4,"I WONT INCLUDE JARGON. HERE IS WHAT I LIKE AND DISLIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE
      
      
      PROS -
      
      1.TEXT WRAPS AUTOMATICALLY ON ZOOM IN BROWSER, A MUST FOR READING.
      
      2.NICE CONTACT BOOK INTEGRATED WITH FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, LINKEDIN ETC. SHOWS ME FACEBOOK UPDATE OF THE PERSON I AM CALLING.
      
      3. LED ON TOP BLINKS TO SHOW IF I SHOULD BE CHECKING MY PHONE FOR UPDATES
      
      4. BEATS AUDIO, MUSIC QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      5. NICE CAMERA
      
      
      CONS -
      
      1. BATTERY LIFE, HARDLY LASTS A DAY
      
      2. A BIT ON SLOWER, I LIKE LIGHTENING FAST DEVICES, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM
      
      3. HANGS SOMETIMES ON DIALING WHICH IS REALLY A SHOW STOPPER
      
      4.NO DEDICATED CAMERA KEY"
HTC One V T320,4,"ITS WORTH A FIVE STAR.. I WAS WAITING FOR THIS PHONE TO BE LAUNCHED IN INDIA FOR 3 MONTHS SINE I KNEW ABOUT IT..
      
      IT WAS LAUNCHED ON 2ND APRIL 2012 AND GUESS WHAT.. I GOT IT ON 7TH APRIL AND THE OCCASION ""MY BIRTHDAY"". WHAT A B'DAY PRESENT FOR ME BY MYSELF. ITS AWESOME..
      
      
      COMING TO FEATURES.. THIS SMARTPHONE IS A POWERHOUSE IN ITSELF. LETS TALK ABOUT ITS AWESOMEMENESS  :
      
      
      1. CAMERA IS FLAWLWSS. DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU SHOOT IN DAY OR NIGHT YOU WILL GET SOME BEST SHOTS YOU EVER TAKEN.. EVENT THOUGH ITS 5MP.. IF YOU ARE HAVING THIS PHONE, I DON'T THINK YOU
      
      NEED TO CARRY ANY DIGITAL CAMERA WITH YOU.. :)
      
      
      2. BEATS AUDIO TAKES THE MUSIC LISTENING TO A NEXT LEVEL..
      
      BUY A GOOD PAIR OF HEADPHONES AND YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THE MUSIC, YOU NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE..
      
      
      3. DISPLAY IS SO SHARP AND COLORS ARE THAT VIVID, YOU DON'T NEED BRAVIA ENGINE BY SONY ANYMORE.. HTC DISPLAY ROCKS..
      
      
      4. HTC SENSE.. A MASTERPIECE OF SOFTWARE APPLICATION MADE BY HTC. IMPROVES PRODUCTIVITY AND PHONE ITSELF LOOKS SMART. AND WITH SENSE UI ITS SMARTEST OF ALL. ;)
      
      
      5. HD GAMING IS FUN.. BUT SOMETIMES ITS A BIT LAGGY..
      
      THE RAM SHOULD HAVE BEEN 768 MB. BUT STILL ITS SUFFICIENT.
      
      
      6. BATTERY IS BEST EVER I EXPERIENCED IN AN ANDROID PHONE.
      
      EVEN THOUGH ITS 1500MAH. A FULL CHARGE AND HARDCORE USAGE FULL DAY STILL RESULTS WITH 20% BATTERY LEFT.
      
      
      7. THE CHIN-UP PHONE DESIGN IS UNIQUE &AMP; FLAWLESS..
      
      
      OVER ALL A VERY GOOD BUDGET PHONE..
      
      NOW, THIS IS THE ""ONE"" I WAS LOOKING FOR..."
HTC One V T320,4,"I'VE BEEN USING THE ONE V FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW AND IT WORKS AS IT SHOULD. ITS CAMERA IS JUST AMAZING, SPECIALLY THE BURST MODE ALTHOUGH THE HDR IS A BIT SLOW. THE AUDIO QUALITY IS ONE OF THE BEST I'VE HEARD IN MOBILE PHONES, THANKS TO BEAT AUDIO.THE PROCESSOR IS DECENT, NOT DUAL CORE BUT WORKS JUST AS WELL. HAD SOME TROUBLES WITH HIGH END GAMES BUT I GUESS THATS WHAT THE ONE X IS FOR. THE OTHER REVIEWS WHICH SAY IT DOESN'T WORK AREN'T VERY ACCURATE. MUST HAVE CAUGHT A VIRUS OR SOMETHING, THERE ARE ANTI-VIRUSES FOR THAT. OR MAYBE THEY OVERLOADED THEIR PHONE WITH THE WRONG APPS. ALL IN ALL A GOOD PHONE. VALUE FOR MONEY."
HTC One V T320,4,"I'VE HAD THIS PHONE FOR MORE THEN 2 WEEKS NOW... BEFORE WHICH I WAS USING AN IPHONE 3G.
      
      THE TOUCH QUALITY AND RESPONSE OF THIS PHONE IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD AND IS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF APPLE!
      
      ITS DESIGN IS GOOD AND IF YOU KEEP IT SCREEN DOWN IT WONT GET SCRATCHED ( IF THE SURFACE IS PLANE)
      
      THE PHONE IS VALUE FOR MONEY. BETTER THEN THE OTHER ANDROID PHONES IN THE"
HTC One V T320,4,"I'VE PURCHASED HTC ONE V 6 MONTHS AGO.. AFTER SME TYME IT WAS OUT OF ORDER.... IT WAS NOT BEING TURNED ONN... I SUBMITTED IT TO SERVICE CENTRE TO GET A REPLACED ONE BT COMPANY TOOK MORE THAN 1 MONTH TO GIVE IT BACK TO ME.... I MADE 100S OF CALL UNTIL I GOT MY FONE BACK BT NOW ITS A PLEASANT EXPIRIENCE WHILE USING IT.... SO THE PRODUCTS R NICE BT THEY HVE TO WORK ON THEIR SERVICE TO COMMAND THE MARKET &AMP; COMPETE WITH SAMSUNG, APPLE OR EVEN WITH NOKIA....... IN LAST, PRODUCTS ARE LIKE A TREAT TO OPERATE &AMP; WORK WITH.."
HTC One V T320,4,"MY FRIEND SUGGESTED ME THIS PHONE, AND I AM IMPRESSED WITH ALMOST ALL OF ITS FEATURES. THE CAMERA IS TOO GOOD, BEATS AUDIO IS THE BEST OF ITS CLASS, THE INTERFACE AND THE EASE OF USAGE IS UNPARALLELED. IT HAS A PRETTY DECENT PROCESSOR AND THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH BATTERY-IT GIVES ME DECENT ONE DAY USAGE.ITS SO CLASSY AND ERGONOMIC, THAT YOU WOULD LOVE TO FLAUNT IT!! I HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE GAMES THAT I RUN, BUT SINCE I AM NOT MUCH OF A GAMER SO I CAN'T GIVE AN HONEST OPINION. OVERALL I SAY GO FOR THIS IF YOUR IDEA IS TO HAVE AN OVERALL GOOD ANDROID PHONE, GOOD LUCK!"
HTC One V T320,4,"OKAY, SO I DON'T CONSIDER MY PURCHASE OF ONE V THE SMARTEST BUY, BUT I THINK IT WAS THE BEST IN PRICE RANGE BACK WHEN I PURCHASED (7 MONTHS AGO)
      
      
      THE PHONE FUNCTIONED REALLY WELL FOR THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS, BUT THEN IT STARTED HANGING ONLY IN PHONE APP, WHICH MADE ME UNABLE TO EVEN TO EVEN MAKE A PHONE CALL. ALSO THE NETWORK CONNECTION DROPPED AND CAUSED CALLS TO END RANDOMLY.
      
      
      FIRST, I PERFORMED A FACTORY RESET, THE PHONE NO LONGER HANGS. THOUGH, I HOPE IT KEEPS THAT WAY FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS. I DONT MIND DOING A FACTORY RESET EVERY 6 MONTHS, IN FACT, ITS MUCH FASTER THAN BEFORE (JUST LIKE NEW).
      
      SECOND, FOR THE NETWORK PROBLEM, I SELECTED 'GSM ONLY' INSTEAD OF 'GSM/WCDMA AUTO' IN MOBILE NETWORK SETTINGS, AND NOW IT GIVES ME 100% SIGNAL AND CALLS DONT DROP. I THINK IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH BSNL 3G BEING POOR.
      
      
      I STILL DONT KNOW IF IT HAS GORILLLA GLASS OR NOT, FKRT HAD MENTIONED WHEN I BOUGHT IT BUT NOW THEY REMOVED IT. SOME REVIEWS SAY IT HAS IT BUT OTHERS SAY IT DOESNT. (ITS NOT IN THE LIST OF OFFICIAL DEVICES HAVING GORILLA GLASS.)
      
      
      NOW FOR THE OTHER PARTS, I REALLY LIKE THE PHONE, THE SCREEN IS AWESOME, THE CAMERA IS SERIOUSLY UNBEATABLE, YOU CAN TAKE MULTIPLE SHOTS OF ANY PLACE VERY QUICKLY, THE VIDEO RECORDING QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD FOR A MOBILE DEVICE. I WATCH TC SHOWS WITH SUBTITLES WITH MX PLAYER, THEY PLAY SMOOTH. IT ALSO PLAYS 720 WELL (THOUGH WATCHING 720P ON A 480P SCREEN IS PLAIN STUPID, UNLESS IT IS AN EMERGENCY) AND ITS METAL UNIBODY LOOKS FANTASTIC (SAMSUNG DEVICES ARE UGLY AS HELL, AND THEY ARENT EVEN VALUE FOR MONEY, THOUGH THEY ARE VERY POPULAR WHICH HAS ITS OWN BENEFITS). (AND FOR THAT GUY WHO SAYS 'NEVER BUY A PHONE WHOSE BATTERY CANNOT BE REMOVED', YOU CAN HOLD THE POWER BUTTON FOR AROUND 10 SECONDS AND THEN THE TOUCH BUTTONS' LIGHTS START BLINKING, AFTER THAT, IT BEHAVES AS IF THE BATTERY WAS REMOVED AND RESTARTS. I HAVE DONE THIS SUCCESSFULLY AND I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT MOBILE MANUFACTURERS ARENT THAT STUPID)
      
      
      OVERALL, ITS A 'GOOD' DEVICE, WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HTC GAVE IT A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR. IT HAS SOME ISSUES, BUT I AM SURE OTHER MOBILES HAVE THEM TOO. ANDROID IS AN OPEN PLATFORM, YOU MAY RUN INTO SOME OF ITS DISADVANTAGEOUS ISSUES ON ANY DEVICE."
HTC One V T320,4,"PHONE HAS NO DOUBT , GREAT BUILD , GUD LOOKS, AWESOME DISPLAY..
      
      BUT LACK OF FRONT CAMERA &AMP; HDMI MIGHT BE DEAL BREAKER
      
      ADREN0 205 ALMOST HANDLE ALL THE STUFF . MIGHT BE BIT LAGGY IF COMPARED TO HIGH END PHONES.
      
      IT'S JUST A BIT PRICY FOR SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR.
      
      BUT OVERALL PHONE LOOKS GREAT
      
      ICS ROCK.... HTC SENSE GUD
      
      QUADRANT SCORE :2350 BETTER THAN GALAXY NEXUS AND OLD DUAL CORE OFFERINGS
      
      NENA MARK :     28 FPS"
HTC One V T320,4,"PROS
      
      1. GREAT BUILD, GOOD TO HOLD AND FEEL.
      
      2. GREAT SCREEN, AS TOLD BY MANY WHOM I SHOWED THE PHONE.
      
      3. GOOD BATTERY LIFE FOR A HTC
      
      4. GOOD PHONE NAVIGATION FOR ICS WHICH WAS ABSENT IN GINGERBREAD BUT IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS WP7 MANGO
      
      5. GREAT CAMERA WITH GREAT FEATURES IN IT SHOOT AND CAPTURE IS THE WAY IT IS.
      
      
      NOW, FOR THE CONS I WOULDN'T REALLY COMPLAIN BUT IT IS AN AREA OF IMPROVEMENT TO BE DONE BY THE HTC PEOPLE.
      
      
      CONS
      
      1. GETS HEATED WHEN PLAYING GRAPHIC INTENSE GAME, BUT NOT SO MUCH TO BOTHER ABOUT AS IT DOESN'T BURN, IMAGINE THE HEAT IN YOUR COMPUTER'S CPU OR EVEN YOUR LAPTOP'S CPU RUNNING A HIGH GRAPHIC GAME, CONSIDERING THAT SCALE IT IS GOOD ENOUGH.
      
      2. INBUILT BATTERY IS NOT A CON BUT IT IS DEFINITELY BOTHERING, IT STAYS IN YOUR MIND, WHAT IF MY PHONE FAILS TO BOOT UP BECAUSE THE BATTERY JUST WENT DEAD EVEN AFTER CHARGING( WORST CASE SCENARIO ).
      
      3. INTERNAL MEMORY, I WOULDN'T COMPLAIN BUT MANY PEOPLE WOULD BECAUSE IT IS A MAJOR THING. NOT MANY DO BUY AN SD CARD OF HIGH CAPACITY AND THANKS TO FLIPKART THEY ARE GIVING 16 GB OF MICROSD .SO IT IS WORTHY THE PRICE.
      
      4. THE SCREEN IS TOO GLOSSY FOR IT TO SUSTAIN SCRATCHES."
HTC One V T320,4,"REALLY AWESOM'    EVERYTHING IS TO GOOD......BUT WAS GIVING IT ONLY FOUR STARS BECAUSE ""IT DOSEN'T HAVE SECONDARY CAMERA""....
      
      
      THANKING HTC FOR THIS COOL SMARTPHONE......
      
      IT'S 4.0 ANDROIDE VERSION IS AWESOM. THE PHONE IS VERY EYE CATCHING AND IT HAVING A GOOD LOOK ALSO...
      
      IT'S TOUCH SCREEN WAS ALSO VERY COOL.... I THINK NO OTHER PHONE -HAVING THIS TYPE OF TOUCH SCREEN. SORRY TO SAMSUNG BUT THIS HTC'S SMARTPHONE WILL COMPLETLY COLLAPSE YOUR REPUTATION.....BECAUSE THIS TYPE OF TOUCH SCREEN PHONE YOU SOLD ON ABOVE 30000 THAUSAND RS. SHAIM ON YOU SAMSUNG....BECAUSE HTC GIVES US THIS TOUCH SCREEN ONLY ON 17000 THAUSAND.....
      
      HAT'S OFF YOU HTC"
HTC One V T320,4,"SINCE I HAVENT USED THIS DEVICE TILL NOW, HERE IS THE PROS AND CONS BY FOLKS AT PHONEARENA:
      
      PROS:
      
      COMPACT AND LIGHTWEIGHT
      
      BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY
      
      ANDROID 4.0
      
      DECENT CAMERA
      
      
      CONS:
      
      WEB BROWSER NEEDS MORE WORK
      
      WAY TOO LITTLE INTERNAL STORAGE
      
      MEDIOCRE 720P VIDEO
      
      
      THEY GAVE IT 8 OUT OF 10.
      
      
      GUYS, SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS,
      
      THANKS."
HTC One V T320,4,"THE HTC ONE V IS SIMPLY FANTASTIC. IT IS THE PERFECT BLEND OF POWER,USABILITY AND COMFORT WHEN LOOKED DOWN AT SPECS.
      
      BUT AS USUAL THE PRICE IS A DOWNER, THE RECENT 2K INCREASE WHICH HAS BEEN MOST PROBABLY DUE TO USD-INR INCREASE HAS ERODED THE SHEEN.
      
      AT 19.5K EVEN WITH FREEBIES IT OUT OF REACH AND IS WAY TOO HIGH CONSIDERING ITS SPECS."
HTC One V T320,4,"THE ONLY DOWNSIDE OF THIS PHONE IS THE LACK OF DIGITAL COMPASS. OTHER THAN THAT, THE PHONE IS SUPERB FOR THAT PRICE POINT WITH THE KIND OF HARDWARE IT BOASTS. SOME MIGHT SAY LACK OF SECONDARY CAMERA IS BAD. BUT IT'S NOT A ISSUE FOR MOST PEOPLE, AS VIDEO CALLING ISN'T THAT WIDESPREAD."
HTC One V T320,4,"THE PHONE IS AMAZING ,AND VERY FAST..PLAYS HD VIDEOS WITHOUT LAGGING. THE ONLY DRAWBACK I A FACING IS THAT THE IN CALL VOLUME IS VERY LOW AND IF YOUR IN A CROWDED AREA ITS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR THE OPPOSITE PERSON ON THE CALL."
HTC One V T320,4,THE PHONE IS REALY NICE ANDROID 4 ICECREAM SANDWICH ROCKS BEST EVER SEEN OS.THE ONLY ONE THING WHICH DISAPPOINTED ME IS THE CAMERA I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST 8MP CAMERA AND A SECONDRY CAMERA. OTHER WISE IT ROCKS
HTC One V T320,4,"THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE BUT AFTER GETTING THIS PHONE I HAVE COMPARED IT WITH OTHER PHONES USED BY FRIENDS (SAMSUNG AND BLACKBERRY), AND MY OPINION IS THIS IS THE BEST PHONE IN THE PRICE RANGE AND TRULY IS CLASSY.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1)TOUCH: SENSITIVE AND EFFICIENT
      
      2) RESOLUTION TOO GOOD
      
      3) MULTITASKING: RUNS SEVERAL APPS SIMULTANEOUSLY WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
      
      4) EXCELLENT SOUND WITH EARPHONES
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) CANT STORE TOO MANY SMS, PHONE GETS SLOW (PPL AT SERVICE CENTER SAYS I NEED TO GET THE OS REINSTALLED)
      
      2) BATTERY LAST MAX FOR 24 EVEN IF YOU MODERATELY USE THE PHONE
      
      3) THE EARPHONES ARE NOT VERY COMFORTABLE."
HTC One V T320,4,"THIS PHONE IS GOOD...PLAYS ALMOST ANY GAME OR APP THROWN AT IT EXCEPT A FEW WHICH REQUIRE BETTER HARDWARE. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT HAD MORE RAM AND CAME IN A 8/16 GB VERSION TOO AS THE ACTUAL
      
      SPACE AVAILABLE TO US AFTER THE OS AND ALL IS JUST 1GB.
      
      IT HAS A GREAT SLIM DESIGN AND GOOD SCREEN RES. (480X800)
      
      IT CAN PLAY 1080P VIDEOS AS WELL (BY MEANS OF DECODING IF A GOOD VIDEO APP IS USED)
      
      AND NOT TO MENTION THE STUDIO QUALITY SOUND OFFERED BY BEAT
      
      NOW I DONT NEED TO CARRY MY MP3 PLAYER ANY MORE..
      
      BATTERY IS ALSO GOOD.. WORKS FOR 5.7-6 HOURS AT CONTINUOUS USAGE"
HTC One V T320,4,"THIS PHONE IS REALLY GOOD FOR THIS PRICE RANGE.HTC SENSE UI MAKES THIS PHONE A CLASS APART FROM BORING SAMSUNG UI.PERFORMANCE IS ACCEPTABLE SINCE I DONT PLAY GAMES ON MOBILE THAT MUCH (IF YOU WANT TO PLAY GRAPHICS INTENSIVE GAME BUY A GODDAMN PC,XBOX OR PS3. I HAVE SEEN PPL SPENDING 29000 TO PLAY MOBILE GAMES.I PITY ON THEM). COMING BACK TO REVIEW I CAN SAY YOU CAN PLAY MANY FAMOUS GAMES WITH DECENT PERFORMANCE.AUDIO QUALITY IS GOOD.CAMERA IS ALSO DECENT 5 MP ( AGAIN IF YOU WANT VERY GOOD IMAGES SPEND 6000 ON DIGITAL CAMERA FOR 12MP CAMERA)
      
      HEADPHONES ARE ONLY OK
      
      
      IN TERMS OF DISADVANTAGE : ONE V CAN GET HOT WHILE PLAYING GAME.
      
      REQUIRE CHARGING 2 TIMES A DAY OF YOU USE MORE.
      
      NO JELLY BEAN UPGRADE FOR ONE V OFFICIALLY. YOU CAN ROOT THE HONE AND ROMS ARE AVAILABLE ON MARKET.I DIDNT TRY TO DO ON YOUR OWN RISK.
      
      
      OVERALL BETTER THAN BORING LOOKING SAMSUNG PHONES.BUILD QUALITY MAKES THIS PHONE FEEL REALLY STURDY IN HANDS."
HTC One V T320,4,"WON'T BORE YOU WITH THE SPECS, HERES THE LOWDOWN
      
      PROS:
      
      1. SUPERB CAMERA, WILL GIVE MANY 8 MP CAMERA A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY
      
      2. ICS PRE-INSTALLED WITH HTC SENSE, YOU GOT TO EXPERIENCE IT TO BELIEVE THAT IT REALLY IS SOMETHING.
      
      3. STUNNING LOOKS, COMFORTABLE TO HOLD THANKS TO ITS UNIBODY DESIGN.
      
      4. SOUND ON EAR-PHONES IS PRETTY GOOD(BEATS AUDIO), BUT JUST ABOVE AVERAGE ON THE SPEAKERS.
      
      5.DECENT PERFORMANCE ON GRAPHIC-INTENSIVE GAMES, BUT DON'T EXPECT IT TO ZOOM THROUGH HIGH-DENSITY GRAPHICS...TEMPLE RUN RUNS LIKE A CHARM THOUGH..:)
      
      6. SCREEN VIEWING ANGLES ARE JUST AWESOME(YOU CAN CLEARLY VIEW THE SCREEN EVEN AT CLOSE TO 90 DEGREES TO THE VERTICAL)
      
      CONS
      
      1.AVERAGE BATTERY LIFE, LASTS AROUND 1-1.5 DAYS WITH MODERATE WIFI USAGE(1-2 HRS),TALKTIME(2-2,5 HOURS)
      
      2.NON-REMOVABLE BATTERY
      
      3.PROCESSOR COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IN THIS PRICE BRACKET, GIVING THE GRAPHICS A BOOST AND USING ICS TO THE FULLEST.
      
      
      VERDICT:
      
      
      IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STYLISH LOOKING ANDROID PHONE, WITH ICS OUT-OF-THE-BOX,GOOD GRAPHICS AND MODERATE GAMING,  GO FOR IT. HTC DOESN'T DISAPPOINT."
HTC One V T320,3,"1 GHZ PROCESSOR SLOW FOR ANDRIOD 4.0 , SOMETIMES IT LAGS(LAGS A LOT), LOOKS ARE GOOD STILL NOT WORTH FOT 17.5K I AM FACING THE SAME PROBLEM .... NOT SATISFIED  &AMP;* NO FRONT CAMERA ALSO :(. 4 GB
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY BUT WE HAVE ONLY ACCESS OF 1 GB :(. 512 MB RAM NOT ENOUGH ..."
HTC One V T320,3,"AT THIS PRICE OF MORE THAN 18K...OR FOR ANY CELLPHONE WITH A PRICE ABV 15K.. AND ABSENCE OF FRONT CAM.. IS A HUGE TURN OFF!
      
      ERICSSON RAY HAS FAIRLY BETTER FEATURES AT THIS PRICE RANGE.
      
      AND HTC HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN OVERPRICED BRAND SO...CUDNT EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE.
      
      ANYWAYS, REST OF THE FEATURES LOOK GOOD TO ME AS PER THE PHONE GOES."
HTC One V T320,3,"BOUGHT IT AND USING FOR ALMOST 4 MONTHS NOW. PROCESSOR AND EVERYTHING IS GREAT. BUT THE EXTERIOR QUALITY IS POOREST. USED DESIRE S FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS NVR FACED MUCH PROBLEM. BUT THIS PHONE IS SHIT WEAK IN COMPARISON WID DESIRE S. BROKEN SCREEN DROPPED FROM KNEE HEIGHT. TOP POWER BUTTON GETS JAMMED. ETC.
      
      
      NOT A ROUGH PHONE ILL SAY, ACTUALLY NOT EVEN A MODERATE PHONE. IF U DROP PHONE ONCE A WEEK, THIS IS NOT A PHONE U WANT.
      
      
      REST ALL GOOD OS CARD ETC."
HTC One V T320,3,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE ALMOST A MONTH BACK. LOVED IT INITIALLY AS IT WAS LOADED WITH FEATURES! HAVE STILL NOT REGRETTED BUYING IT THOUGH. THE ONE PROBLEM I HAVE BEEN FACING IS WITH THE PHONE GETTING HEATED UP WHILE MULTITASKING. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME. I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE PHONE GETS UNBEARABLY HOT WHEN YOU PERFORM MULTIPLE TASKS (EG:MORE THAN 15/20 MINS OF INTERNET BROWSING AND WHILE PLAYING GAMES). MUCH TO BE BLAMED IS THE RAM AND THE PROCESSORS OF THIS PHONE. WITH ONLY 512 MB RAM AT IT'S DISPOSAL, THE PHONE IS A TAD SLOWER AND STRUGGLES WHEN MULTIPLE APPS ARE OPEN. THIS HEATING UP REDUCES THE BATTERY LEVEL BY ALMOST 50% WHICH AGAIN IS A CAUSE OF CONCERN. APART FROM THIS, THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE PHONE IS VERY GOOD. KUDOS TO ICS.WELL THEN TO SUMMARIZE I WOULD SAY, ""THE PHONE IS HOT"", LITERALLY!"
HTC One V T320,3,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE ALMOST A YEAR BACK. THIS ALONG WITH OTHERS, HAS MADE ME A FAN OF HTC.
      
      WAS MY FIRST 'SMART' PHONE, SO WAS OK FOR FEW MONTHS. THEN I STARTED NOTICING ISSUES.
      
      THERE'S A KNOWN ISSUE WITH CONTACTS - CONTACTS WILL NOT LOAD, GET STUCK, NUMEROUS TIMES.
      
      SAME FOR MESSAGES.
      
      I THINK THIS IS EXPECTED GIVEN THE LOW PROCESSING SPEED ON THIS MODEL."
HTC One V T320,3,"DEFINITELY A GOOD PHONE
      
      
      PROS -
      
      
      HTC SENSE
      
      G SENSOR WORKS REALLY NICELY
      
      THE BEATS AUDIO SOFTWARE ISN'T A REAL BOOST BUT SURELY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
      
      THE CAMERA IS GOOD, GREAT INFACT.
      
      SD CARD CAN BE REMOVED WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO SWITCH OFF THE PHONE OR SO
      
      THE SCREEN IS BIG, AND THE SHAPE IS VERY NICE, PERFECTLY FITS IN MY HANDS
      
      THE INTERNET PASS-THROUGH OPTION IS PRETTY GOOD, DUNNO IF IT'S THERE IN OTHER PHONES, BUT IT WORKS PERFECTLY ON THIS PHONE
      
      
      CONS -
      
      NO BEATS HEADPHONES/EARPLUGS ARE PROVIDED IN THE PACK
      
      RAM IS JUST 512 MB, YOU CAN EXPERIENCE LAG IN HEAVY-GRAPHIC APPS
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY IS BARELY A 100 MB
      
      THE PHONE GETS HEATED QUICKLY IF PUT ON CHARGING/RUN ON GAMING-APPS FOR A LONG TIME
      
      HIGH-QUALITY VIDEO RECORDING
      
      
      IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO BUY THIS PHONE, I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO BUY ANOTHER ONE, IT'S A GOOD PHONE BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE"
HTC One V T320,3,"EVERYTHING IS GOOD ABOUT THIS PHONE EXCEPT ONE THING...IT HAS NO COMPASS !!! THIS SINGLE THING ALONE SADDENS THE WHOLE PARTY...I MEAN COMMON EVEN A 10000 RUPEE PHONE HAS IT.
      
      
      SECONDARILY ITS STOCK BROWSER DOESN'T PERFORM AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD. BARRING MATERIALS QUALITY AND SCREEN, SONY NEO V NOW SEEMS TO BE A BETTER BET."
HTC One V T320,3,"FIRST OF ALL HATS OFF TO FLIPKART WHATEVER PRICE OF THE PRODUCT IS THEY ARE READY TO DELIEVER IT IN 2 DAYS NOT AT ALL COMPLAINT FROM THEM
      
      NOW IAM A BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PHONE I HAVE AN APPLE IPOD TOUCH 4G N SAMSUNG OMNIA W SO I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING BRILLIANT FROM THIS BUT DOESNT GOT IT , VIRTUAL KEYPAD IS NOT AT ALL UPTO THE MARK WHEN IT COMES TO DIALLING AND TYPING ,MENU IS UGLY LOOKING BUT SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD NICE PHONE IF U R A FIRST TIME USER GETS HEATED UP QUICKLY"
HTC One V T320,3,"FLIPKART SERVICE EXCEEDS EXPECTATION, SENSE OF RELIABILITY. ITS GOOD THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LOGISTICS. I WOULDN'T MIND THE PREMIUM COST CHARGED BY FLIPKART COMPARED TO AN EBAY SELLER.
      
      
      AS FAR AS THE PHONE IS CONCERNED, ITS AMAZING AND FAST. THE INTERFACE IS WELL DESIGNED AND VERY INTUITIVE, THANKS TO SENSE4. FOR THE BEST ANDROID EXPERIENCE HTCS RANK NO. 1 AND THEN COME OTHERS.
      
      
      NOW FOR A FEW CONS:
      
      
      1. ONLY 1GB OF THE 4GB INTERNAL STORAGE IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER
      
      2. NO FRONT-FACING CAMERA
      
      3. DESERVES A DUAL-CORE PROCESSOR
      
      4. DOES NOT HAVE A REPLACEABLE BATTERY
      
      5. NO DEDICATED CAMERA KEY
      
      
      OVERALL I STILL RATE THE DEVICE HIGHER IN EXPERIENCE THAN ITS CONTENDERS, BUT WILL GIVE IT THREE STARS ONLY BECAUSE OF LACK OF SECONDARY CAMERA. WHATS THE POINT OF HAVING ICS AND A SUPERCOOL PHONE WHEN I CANNOT MAKE VIDEO CALLS AND USE FACE-UNLOCK FEATURE OF ICS.
      
      
      THANKS FLIPKART FOR A SMOOTH BUYING EXPERIENCE."
HTC One V T320,3,"GREAT LOOKS, TWO ISSUES WITH THIS PHONE
      
      
      +VE'S:
      
      -- THE TOUCH FEATURE IN THIS PHONE IS NOT THAT SHARP. THE HTC WILDFIRE IS WAY BETTER AND COSTS 2/3.
      
      -- THE CAMERA CLICK FEATURE IS NOT CENTRALLY ALIGNED AND HENCE IS A BIG ISSUE WHEN CLICKING PICS. YOU TEND TO WAIVER AND GET BLURRED PICS.
      
      
      SINCE THIS MODEL IS BEING SOLD ON THE CAMERA BEING VERY GOOD (IT INDEED IS), WHAT ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO USE THE GOOD CAMERA!!
      
      
      ALSO WHEN YOU USE APPS LIKE WHATSAPP ETC...THE MENU FEATURE IS UNAVAILABLE -- IN WILDFIRE &AMP; EXPLORER @ LEAST THEY WERE VISIBLE. SO IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE SETTINGS IN WHATSAPP...KEEP LOOKING AND YOU WONT FIND ANY CLICK/BUTTON TO HELP U DO THAT.
      
      
      AS THEY HAVE REDUCED ONE BUTTON COMPLETELY FROM OUTSIDE THETHE SCREEN...IE THE MENU BUTTON!!!"
HTC One V T320,3,"HEY GUYS I OWN A HTC ONE V,ITS BEEN AN YEAR,I GOT IT FOR 16.5 BUT I M REALLY SHOCKED TO SEE IT PRICED AT NEARLY 20K.20K FOR SUCH A LOW CONFIGURATION,ITS TRUE PRICE SHOULD BE AROUND 12K.WHAT ARE HTC GUYS OR FLIPKART GUYS THINKING..
      
      
      JUST SEE THE CONFIGURATIONS YOURSELF AND YOU WILL KNOW..
      
      
      SHOCKING..!!!
      
      
      BUT OVERALL THE PHONE OS GREAT,NICE SCREEN,NICE CAMERA,AVERAGE BATTERY BUT NOT GOOD FOR PLAYING GAMES DUE TO ITS LIMITED RAM AND PROCESSOR CAPABILITIES."
HTC One V T320,3,"HI ALL, IN MY SET I ALSO FACE YELLOW COLOR PROBLEM. TODAY I WENT HTC SERVICE CENTER. THEN I CAME TO KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING IN MANY SETS. I GAVE FOR THE REPLACEMENT, HOPE IN NEW I WILL NOT FACE THIS PROBLEM. BUT SERVICE CENTER IS TAKING 4-7 DAYS FOR THIS. ALSO THE OPEN CONTACT AND DIAL PROBLEM I WAS FACING MEANS FOR THIS I HAVE TO WAIT 3-5 MIN. SAME TO REPLY A MESSAGE. I ASKED AND THEY REPLY THAT IN NEW SET I WILL NOT FACE THIS PROBLEM. AND FOR THOSE FACING THIS PROBLEM PLZ CONTACT SERVICE CENTER, THEY WILL UPDATE S/W."
HTC One V T320,3,"HI BROUGHT THIS PHONE FROM ANOTHER RETAIL CHAIN.... THE PHONE WAS QUIET GOOD AT FIRST, LATE IT SHOWED SOME LAGGING......... AFTER 3 MONTHS SOME PART OF THE TOUCH SCREEN BECAME UNRESPONSIVE.... I GAVE IT TO THE AUTHORISED SERVICE CENTER IN COCHIN , IT TOOK ALMOST 3 WEEKS TO RETURN MY CELL PHONE....... YESTERDAY I GOT MY MOBILE AND NOW THE LIPO SEEMS TO BE DRAINING TOO MUCH, NEARLY 6 HRS FOR A FULL CHARGE.......
      
      
      * IF YOU ARE FROM KERALA NEVER EXPECT A GOOD SERVICE FROM THE AUTHORISED SERVICE CENTER, MOST OF THEM MAKE U SICK...
      
      
      * THE PHONE IS AN ABOVE AVERAGE ONE, THE DISPLAY IS THE BEST PART OF THE PHONE, IN MY OPINION  HTC SENCE IS THE BEST AMONG OTHER UIS......."
HTC One V T320,3,"I AM USING HTC ONE V SINCE LAST TWO WEEK.IT IS A GOOD LOOKING SEXY PHONE.BUT WHEN I USE IT I FOUND THAT IT'S NOT REALLY SO GOOD.IT'S AUTO ROTATE SENSER R NOT GOOD ,IT DOES NOT RESPOND MOST OF TIME.WHEN I WATCH VEDIO AND FORWARD IT THE SOUND STOP AUTOMATICALLY AND ONLY THE VEDIO CONTINUE PLAYING.IT DOES HAVE DIGITAL COMPASS WHICH MOST OF THE ANDRIOD PHONE HAVE."
HTC One V T320,3,"I BOUGHT MY HTC ONE V ON JUNE 2. IT STOPPED WORKING ON 29TH JUNE, HTC SAYS THAT ALL THE PIECES MANUFACTURED IN JUNE OR BEFORE ARE DEFECTED. THEY ARE TAKING A LONG TIME TO REPLACE. THE BATTERY DOESN'T COME OUT SAME AS IPHONE SO WHENEVER YOUR PHONE GETS HANGED SO IT IS A QUITE A BIG PROBLEM"
HTC One V T320,3,"I BOUGHT THIS ON JUNE 3RD AND LIKED IT COMES WITH ANDROID 4.X
      
      BUT ON JULY 6TH IT DIED. WHEN TOOK IT TO SERVICE CENTER THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE FIRST BATCH OF THIS MODEL IS SHIPPED WITH FAULTY BOARD WHICH WILL KILL THE PHONE IN LESS THAN 5 WEEKS.
      
      
      THEY ALSO ARE GIVING A REPLACEMENT WHICH WILL TAKE 15 DAYS OR SO.  AWAITING THE REPLACEMENT.
      
      
      I HAVE USED WILDFIRE WITH NO ISSUES FOR LONG AND SWITCHED TO HTC ONE V. BUT SINCE THIS DIED I WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING FUTURE MODELS."
HTC One V T320,3,"I CHOOSEN THIS PHONE BECOZ OF ITS GR8 TOUCH.... BUT I FELT SORRY Y I JUST THROWN 18.5K FOR HTC ONE V..... ITS ALWAYS GET HANGED .... WHEN I OPEN MESSAGE INBOX IT GET HANGED... A BLANK SCREEN CAME WITH MESSAGE TITLE WRITTEN ON TOP AND AFTER SOMETYM A MESSAGE COME UP AND SAY MESSAGE NOT WORKING PRESS OK OR REPORT TO HTC, SAME PROBLEM WITH CONTACTS, WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK APPLICATIONS........
      
      WHY THIS HAPPEN EVEN IT HAS 1 GHZ PROCESSOR....I DONT UNDERSTAND....
      
      I LYK HTC'S SOUND BEATSAUDIO AS WELL ITS OUTPUT SPEAKER..... GIVES A CLARITY SOUND..... I HAVE A NO. OF APPLICATIONS INSTALLED, NOT AS MUCH.... BUT NO ISSUE ABOUT BATTERY BACKUP AND ANY WARM BATTERY ISSUE........ITS OK ABOUT THE BATTERY....."
HTC One V T320,3,"I PURCHASED THE HTC ONE V A FEW MONTHS AGO FROM FLIPKART AFTER THOROUGHLY RESEARCHING THE PRODUCT. THIS IS NOT MY FIRST HTC, ITS MY THIRD. THE LAST ONE WAS THE EXPLORER AND HAVING USED THAT FOR ABOUT A YEAR I FELT THE NEED TO UPGRADE.
      
      EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ONE V SOUNDED SUPERB TO ME. HAVING USED IT FOR SOME TIME NOW, I CAN SAY:
      
      
      THE SIZE - CAN OPERATE WITH ONE HAND AND VERY POCKET FRIENDLY.
      
      DESIGN - I QUITE LIKED THE CHIN AND THE UNIBODY CONSTRUCTION....ROCK SOLID.
      
      HTC SENSE - IS LEGENDARY, WORKS GREAT AND I LOVE IT.
      
      DISPLAY - FANTASTIC AND SHARP AS IS THE TOUCH INTERFACE, FOR A PHONE AT THIS PRICE POINT.
      
      CAMERA - AGAIN PRETTY GOOD AND I DON'T HAVE ANY CAUSE TO COMPLAIN. THE PICS ARE SHARP, GREAT COLORS AND IF ITS THE ONLY CAMERA YOU HAVE ON A TRIP, YOU'LL BE FINE. THE IN-CAMERA SETTINGS ARE CLASS LEADING.
      
      
      SO IF THIS PHONE DOES EVERYTHING SO WELL, WHY DO I FEEL COMPELLED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW? BECAUSE THE ONLY DRAWBACK OF THIS PHONE IS THAT IT IS SO SO SO SLOW. CHANGING BETWEEN APPLICATIONS IS AN HERCULEAN TASK FOR THIS PROCESSOR.
      
      
      FOR EXAMPLE, TO SWITCH FROM YOUR PHONE BOOK OR CAMERA OR EMAIL OR JUST BACK TO HOME PAGE OR BETWEEN ANY OTHER APPLICATION JUST TAKES FOREVER. IN TERMS OF TIME, SWITCHING BETWEEN APPLICATIONS WHICH SHOULD NORMALLY BE A TAP AWAY, TAKES NOTHING LESS THAN 5 TO 6 SECONDS. MY EXPLORER WAS FASTER BY AT LEAST 10 TIMES WITHOUT EXAGGERATION.
      
      SO BE WARNED, THIS PHONE IS THE TYPE THAT DOES EVERYTHING SO WELL, YOU WANT TO LOVE IT.
      
      BUT IT IS JUST SO PAINFULLY SLOW, IT'LL MAKE YOU GRIND YOUR TEETH IN AGONY."
HTC One V T320,3,"IF U WANT THIS PHONE FOR MUSIC,PHOTOS,VIDEO RECORDING THIS PHONES IS  GOOD AT ALL THIS BUT IT DOES NOT PROVIDE GOOD HEADPHONES
      
      SECONDLY IT HAS MANY GREAT FEATURES THAT OTHER PHONES LACK ARE ICS AND IT ALSO HAS HTC SENSE 4.0 WHICH IS REALLY BLOW YOUR FRIENDS MIND."
HTC One V T320,3,"IN US IT 300-330 $ (15000RS), SO GUYS ITS ALL THE TAXES WE JUST PAYING, ON OTHER SIDE GOV PROVIDING AAKASH TAB TO REACH OF EVERY1 BUT FORGET THAT TELE MOB IS NOW FUTURE OF INDIA, PEOPLE DONT SIT IN THERE HOMES WORKING WIT THEIR PC. BUT ITS THE MOBILE GOV SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THEIR PRICES.
      
      THANKS FLIPCART MAKING SOME PRICE CUT TO BUY"
HTC One V T320,3,"I'VE BEEN USING THE PHONE FOR OVER A MONTH NOW. FIRST THE PROS...
      
      - GOOD FORM FACTOR

      - NICE SCREEN

      NOW THE CONS.....
      
      - THE PROCESSOR EVEN AT 1GHZ SERIOUSLY LACK PROCESSING POWER...THE PHONE JUST LAGS IN EVERYTHING IT DOES FROM DIALING A NUMBER TO OPENING CONTACTS LIST TO ANY OTHER PROCESS
      
      - STOCK BROWSER IS STRICTLY OK...YOU HAVE BETTER OPTIONS ON PLAY
      
      - STOCK KEYBOARD FEELS CRAMPED UP

HTC One V T320,3,JUST A SMALL INFO NO JB FOR THIS CELL MAYBE BECAUSE OF RAM WHICH IS 512 MB. BUT IF THAT IS NOT UR PROBLEM THEN THIS IS A GOOD BUY. BUT THRZ LOTS OF OPTION NWDAYS. THIS WILL BE SAME FOR DESIRE C (NO JB).
HTC One V T320,3,"PHONE IS GOOD FOR A NORMAL USAGE. NORMAL? YES, FOR NORMAL CALLS, TEXTING, INTERNET, SOFT GAMES AND OTHER APPS. THE CAMERA IS GOOD. HEAVY APPS LIKE TEMPLE RUN DOESNT WORK. BIT SLOW AT TIMES. BUT I'M SATISFIED WITH EVERY OTHER THING ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      BUT, JUST 15 DAYS AFTER MY PURCHASE (6 MONTHS AGO), THE PHONE WAS TOTALLY DEAD. YES, IT WAS ""DEAD"". WITH THE INABILITY TO REMOVE AND CHECK THE BATTERY, I WAS FORCED TO TAKE THIS MOBILE TO THE ONLY SERVICE CENTRE IN CHENNAI. THEY SAID THEY WOULD REPLACE IF IT HAD GONE FAULT WITHIN 14 DAYS AND AS MINE WAS 15 DAYS, THEY WILL OPEN AND REPAIR IT. I PROTESTED THAT I WANNA GET THIS PIECE REPLACED ON WHICH I WAS TOLD TO GET A DEATH CERTIFICATE FROM HTC BY GIVING A TOLL FREE NUMBER. FOLLOWING UP ON WHICH TOOK ME 1 WEEK TO GET IT APPROVED. ON SURRENDERING THE OLD PHONE, IT TOOK 5 WEEKS FOR THEM TO GET IT REPLACED.
      
      
      THIS HAD BEEN WORKING WEL SINCE THEN. BUT RECENTLY 2 DAYS BACK, MY PHONE WAS AGAIN DEAD, WITH SCREEN NOT WORKING. TO MY SURPRISE, IT'S WORKING SINCE THIS MORNING.
      
      
      HTC ONE V IS SO UNPREDICTABLE AND IT'S NOT ONE OR 2 THOUSANDS THAT IT EATS UP. IT'S ARND 18K WHICH YOU WIL INVEST ON THE PHONE. THINK BEFORE YOU BUY!! MY 2 CENTS.."

HTC One V T320,3,"SIMULATE A BATTERY PULL
      
      SINCE THE HTC ONE V DOES NOT HAVE A REMOVABLE BATTERY, THERE IS AN ALTERNATE METHOD TO SIMULATE THE PROCESS OF PULLING THE BATTERY TO KILL POWER TO THE DEVICE. TO DO THIS, PRESS AND HOLD THE POWER KEY FOR 10 SECONDS. THE CAPACITIVE BUTTONS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN SHOULD BEGIN FLASHING FOR 5 SECONDS BEFORE THE DEVICE WILL POWER OFF COMPLETELY AND THEN RESTART.

HTC One V T320,3,"THATS RIGHT ITS A NEW WINE(ICS) IN OLD BOTTLE (HARDWARE).
      
      
      SPECS TO NOTICE - 1GHZ SINGLE CORE(QUALCOMM MSM8255 SNAPDRAGON); 5 MP CAMERA WITH 720P HD RECORDING;ADRENO 205; 4GB INTERNAL(1GB ACCESSIBLE); ICS; SENSE UI 4.0
      
      
      *REASONS WHY ONE SHOULDN'T BUY HTC ONE V:
      
      
      IF YOU WANT THE BRAND NAME YOU CAN BUY THIS FOR THE PRICE, BUT ASK YOURSELF AREN'T THERE MUCH BETTER PHONES IN THE PRICE RANGE(15K-20K), FOR EG SAMSUNG GALAXY S ETC.
      
      
      WITH THE FEATURES AFOREMENTIONED I CAN EASILY RELATE THE HARDWARE TO MOTOROLA DEFY/DEFY+, WHY? JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE SPECS, THEY ARE BASICALLY THE SAME, EXCEPT OFCOURSE ICS AND SENSE UI 4.0.
      
      
      HTC SHOULD HAVE GIVE A BIT MORE IN THE HARDWARE SECTION, ITS NOT LIKE ITS NOT A GOOD PHONE, BUT MY ADVICE RATHER SAVE UP THE EXTRA 2K-3K FOR ACCESSORIES AND BUY DEFY OR SOME OTHER PHONE WITH SAME(CHEAPER)/EXTRA FEATURES.
      
      
      COMPARISON(DEFY+ VS ONE V) -
      
      
      ONE V (PLUS POINTS AGAINST DEFY+):
      
      ======
      
      - HTC SENSE UI V4.0
      
      - BLUETOOTH V4.0 WITH A2DP
      
      - CAMERA HD RECORDING @ 720P (CAN BE ACHIEVED IN DEFY TOO THROUGH MODS)
      
      - ANDROID OS, V4.0 (ICE CREAM SANDWICH)
      
      
      DEFY PLUS (PLUS POINTS AGAINST ONE V):
      
      ===========
      
      - SCREEN 3.7 INCHES WITH ~265 PPI PIXEL DENSITY(ONE V HAS 252PPI)
      
      - 2 GB INTERNAL AND 1GB ROM
      
      - 1700MAH BATTERY
      
      
      REST IS YOUR DECISION.
      
      
      *NOW FOR REASONS WHY ONE SHOULD BUY HTC ONE V :
      
      
      ONE V IS A STYLISH, PETITE, ENTRY-LEVEL MODEL THAT WILL HOPEFULLY DRAW IN ANYONE LOOKING FOR A NEW PHONE RUNNING ANDROID'S LATEST. A GREAT PHONE FOR FIRST TIME ANDROID BUYERS. PHONE HAS A STURDY BUILT - ALUMINIUM UNIBODY AND GORILLA GLASS, DONT WORRY ABOUT THE SCRACTHES ON THE PHONE, FROM BOTH FRONT AND BACK, YOU WILL ALSO NOTICE SCREEN IS SLIGHTLY RAISED OFCOURSE COATED BY THE GORILLA GLASS. THE REAR HAS PLASTIC COVERING, CASING FOR MICROSD AND SIM SLOTS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO BATTERY ACCESS. SCREEN HAS 800 X480 RESOLUTION, A 3.7-INCH SCREEN WITH SUPER LCD 2 PANEL. DENSITY IS A BIT LOW ~252PPI ALTHOUGH THE SCREEN IS NOT TOO GRAINY, GOOD VIEWING ANGLES. 5 MP CAMERA(F/2.0 LENS) WITH AMAZING FEATURES LIKE SLOW-MOTION. BLUETOOTH IS V4.0 SO YOU CAN EXPECT SOME GOOD DATA TRANSFER SPEEDS VIA BLUETOOTH.
      
      
      PROS -
      
      
      - STYLISH LOOKS, GREAT BODY
      
      - BLUETOOTH V4.0
      
      - USER-INTERFACE IS EXCELLENT
      
      - GREAT BOOT UP TIME
      
      - GOOD PERFORMANCE FOR A 1500MAH BATTERY
      
      - TRIBAND AND QUADBAND SPEEDS ARE GOOD
      
      - CLEAR CALLS
      
      - MEDIOCRE CAMERA, BUT PACKED WITH GOOD SOFTWARE
      
      - ANDROID V4 ICE CREAM SANDWICH
      
      - SCRATCH RESISTENT BODY AND SCREEN
      
      
      CONS -
      
      
      - 1GHZ SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR, THE PHONE STUTTERS SOMETIMES WHILE BROWSING MENUS
      
      - LOW INTERNAL MEMORY
      
      - CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT UPTO THE MARK
      
      - STRUGGLES IN HEAVY-GRAPHICS GAMES
      
      - WEB BROWSING
      
      - REMOVABLE MEMORY CARDS ARE A NECESSITY
      
      - NO FRONT CAMERA
      
      - NO DIGITAL COMPASS
      
      - NO HTC MEDIA LINK HD
      
      
      CONCLUSION : IF ITS YOUR FIRST TIME BUYING AN ANDROID PHONE - GO FOR IT.
      
      OTHERS CAN WAIT FOR PRICES TO COME DOWN OR GATHER SOME MONEY TO GO FOR BETTER PHONES, LIKE GALAXY S OR EVEN SII.
      
      REALLY NOT A PHONE TO BE PRICED RS.18299(SUBJECT TO CHANGE)"
HTC One V T320,3,"THIS PHONE IS AMAZING,BUT THERE ARE ISSUES REGARDING THE AS I AM GAMER ,BUT MOST OF TIME TEMPLE RUN AND SO MANY GAMES ARE NOT RUNNING PROPERLY.
      
      IN FIRST 10 DAYS A HAVE FACED A LOT OF ISSUES.
      
      THINGS REALLY REQUIRED TO BE IMPROVED IS .
      
      1) HTC SERVICE CENTER(HELL SERVICE BY HTC SERVICE CENTER ,I EVEN DON'T FIND SUCH A BAD SERVICE IN SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTER).
      
      2) MOST OF HANDSETS HAVE YELLOW SCREEN PROBLEM ,SO CHECK SCREEN PROPERLY IN WHITE DISPLAY WHILE TAKING HTC .
      
      3) SOME TIME HANDSET IS TAKING SMALL TIME WHEN YOU ARE SWITCHING DIRECTLY TO DESKTOP OF HANDSET.\
      
      APART FROM THAT HANDSET HTC ONE V IS AWESOME,GOOD SOUND SUPPORT ALL MOST ALL FORMATS OF VIDEOS AND INTERNET IS RUNNING AWESOME ON THAT.SOUND IS SERIOUSLY SUPERB.
      
      I LOVE THE HANDSET ,ITS GOOD THEN SAMSUNG AT ALL STAGES."
HTC One V T320,2,512MB RAM AND 1GHZ SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR JUST CANNOT COPE WITH THE ICS AND SENSE 4! EXPERIENCES A LOT OF LAG. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USERS WHO ARE IN TO GAMES OR USE A LOT OF APPS. GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN EXPERIENCE A LOT OF LAG AND ARE UNPLAYABLE AT TIMES!
HTC One V T320,2,"AGAIN HTC HAS OVERPRICED THE PHONE. THIS PHONE DOES NOT DESERVES MORE THAN 17K.
      
      LETS SEE IF IT COULD GO DOWN A BIT. SECONDARY CAMERA IS ALSO MISSING, BUT THE DESIGN IS QUITE GOOD. BUT AFTER SEEING THE PRICE I THINK I HAVE TO WAIT FOR OTHER ICS PHONES IN THE MARKET."
HTC One V T320,2,"FRIENDS..
      
      
      PLZ DONT GO FOR ONE-V, I BOUGHT IT ONE MONTH BACK AND NOW MY PHONE IS WITH SERVICE CENTER, THE PHONE WAS COMPLETELY DEAD WITHOUT ANY REASON, WHEN I WENT TO SERVICE CENTER I HAVE FOUND LOT OF ONE-V PHONES WITH SAME PROBLEM, THOUGH COMPANY IS REPLACING THE PHONE WE CANNOT AFFORD TWO WEEKS TIME FOR IT AND ALSO THEY ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE NEW PHONE, WITH ALL BEST FEATURES THIS IS THE BEST PHONE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET BUT WITH SUCH MAJOR PROBLEM ITS NOT WORTH FOR ITS BRAND VALUE.."
HTC One V T320,2,"HELLO,
      
      
      IF YOU WANT PERFORMACE. I'M SORRY THIS ONE IS NOT FOR YOU. I OWN THIS PHONE SINCE FOUR MONTHS NOW. I AM HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PERFORMACE HTC ONE V HAS DELIVERED. IT DOES NOT HAVE HARDWARE ISSUES. ITS MEANT TO GIVE HIGH PERFORMACE, BUT THE STOCK ANDROID 4.0.3 WITH HTC SENSE LAYER ON IT REDUCES THE PERFORMACE TO NOTICIABLY LOW FIGURES.
      
      
      RAM - 512 MB - YOU CAN USE ONLY 247 MB OF RAM BECAUSE THE OS EATS UP THE REST.
      
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY - 4 GB - YOU CAN USE ONLY 847 MB BECAUSE THE OS EATS UP THE REST! MEMORY HUNGRY HTC SENSE!!
      
      
      IF YOU WANT GOOD PERFORMACE, BUYING THIS PHONE WON'T BE A GOOD IDEA. PHONE IS STRICTLY FOR MINIMAL INTERNET SURFERS.
      
      
      REGARDS,

HTC One V T320,2,"HTC ONE V IS A GREAT PHONE WITHIN 20000,HAS AMAZING CAMERA AND LOADED WITH AMAZING FEATURES TOO BUT DUE TO ITS 1GHZ PROCESSOR SOMETIMES IT BECOMES SLOW. WHILE PLAYING HIGH GRAPHICS GAMES IT LAGS....NO FRONT FACING CAMERA N YA ONLY 512 MB OF RAM........ IT HAS INTERNAL MEMORY OF 4 GB BUT ONLY 1 GB OF INTERNAL MEMORY IS FREE FOR USERS..... BUT STILL IT IS A NICE PHONE.........."
HTC One V T320,2,"I AM USING THIS DEVICE SINCE LAST 4 MONTHS, AND I FACED MANY PROBLEM WITH THIS DEVICE LIKE:
      
      1. HANGS ANYTIME(MAJOR PROBLEM)- (I DINT HAVE TOO MUCH APPS , ONLY FACEBOOK APP I HAVE)
      
      2. AUTOMATIC RESTARTED MANY TIMES(IN THE INITIAL STAGE, I.E WITHIN 10 DAYS).
      
      3. VERY SLOW WHILE I STARTED 2-3 APPS (I.E MULTITASKING IS DOUBT ABLE, I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE SCREEN)
      
      4. THE WORST: UI , I.E HTC SENSE INTERFACE .(MANY THING ARE MISSING. THE MAJOR IS WHILE CAPTURING VIDEOS PAUSE BUTTON IS NOT THERE, AND CALL RECORDING IS NOT THERE WHILE CALLING)
      
      
      I THINK THIS IS MY WORST CATCH.
      
      I SUGGEST NOT TO GO WITH REVIEW AND PRODUCTS ON FLIPKART OR ANY OF THE WEBSITE. ITS BETTER YOU TAKE IT FROM SHOPS.
      
      SOME FAKE REVIEW ARE ALSO THERE WITH EACH WEBSITE, SO DONT BELIEVE ON THOSE.
      
      
      ALSO THE PRODUCT I GOT FROM FLIPKART HAVING SOME MANUFACTURE DEFECTS IN BODY.
      
      
      SO USE YOUR MIND WHILE SPENDING...ITS URS MONEY.... :(
      
      
      BAD EXPERIENCE EVER WITH HTC ONE V."
HTC One V T320,2,"I BROUGHT THIS PHONE AND TO MY SURPRISE THE CAMERA IS SO POOR THAT ITS HORRIBLE THEN MY MICROMAX PHONES. I HAD HTC DESIRE HD AND THE CAMERA WAS WONDERFUL. I NEVER EXPECED THAT NEW GENERATION HTC PHONES WOULD HAVE SUCH A HORRIBLE CAMERA QUALITY. I KNOW ITS 5MP. BUT MY OLD IPHONE3GS WITH 3.2MP HAS 100TIMES BETTER IMAGE QUALITY.
      
      THE HTC ONE CAMERA MAKES ALL YELLOW SPOTS ON THE FACE. THE YELLOW NOISE LEVEL IS TOO HIGH. IT TAKES PICTURES AT HIGH ISO VALUE. THE PICTURES ARE NOT SHARP. THEY BLUR.
      
      I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PHONE IF YOUR CONCERN ON CAMERA QUALITY. I ALSO HAVE SONY EXPERIA U. THE CAMERA IS WONDERFUL AND ITS 10 TIMES BETTER THAN THIS HTC ONE. ITS CHEAP. BUT ONLY PROBLEM IS IT HAS ONLY 4GB NON EXPANDABLE MEMORY.
      
      ONE GOOD SIDE OF THIS HTC ONE, I CAN RATE SOUND QUALITY HIGHER AND THE UI IS DONE VERY WELL THEN THE SONY EXPERIA U."
HTC One V T320,2,"I GOT THIS PHONE FROM MY FRIEND BEFORE 1 DAY.
      
      I WAS REALLY SURPRISED WITH THIS KIND OF ""BLOODY"" HTC PHONE. I WAS THINKING HTC IS JUST BETTER THAN SAMSUNG. BUT SERIOUSLY NOW AM SCARED FROM HTC.
      
      FIRST THINGS IS THAT HTC IS SAYING IT HAS 4GB INBUILT MEMORY.
      
      BUT I DIDN'T FOUND MORE THAN 91.25 MB. SO IT DOESN'T HAVE 4GB INBUILT MEMORY.
      
      SECOND THINGS IS THAT MY NOKIA C7 PERFORMES BETTER THAN THIS HTC.
      
      HTC PLAYS .MKV, MP4 VIDEOS BUT NOT VERY SMOOTHLY. IT GETS ALOT LAG. SO WE CAN'T ENJOY WATCHING VIDEOS OR MOVIES.
      
      EVEN MY C7 PLAYS 4GB DUAL AUDIO AVATAR IN BLUERAY FORMAT WITHOUT ANY LAG.
      
      THIRD ONE IS SOMETIMES IT GETS FULLY MUTED. WE CAN'T HEAR RINGTONE, VIDEO SONG, ANY AUDIO FILE, PHONE CALLS ALSO ETC.
      
      BIGGEST CALL DROP PROBLEM.
      
      4] HTC SAID THAT IT HAS 512MB RAM ..BUT AGAIN THEY BREAK THE TRUST. ITS JUST HAVING 367MB RAM. EVEN FRUIT NINJA(LITE VERSION) ALSO DOESN'T PLAYS VERY GOOD. SOMETIMES IT GETS LAG AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CUT SINGLE FRUIT.
      
      5] SOMETIMES CAMERA GETS HANGED. I NEED TO RESTORE FACULTY SETTINGS EVERY TIME WHENEVER CAMERA GETS HANGED. I RESTARTED THIS PHONE 13 TIMES IN A DAY. I REALLY FRUSTRATED WITH IT.
      
      6] I REALLY DIDN'T FIND HOW TO SET LIVE WALLPAPER ON ONE V
      
      7] AGAIN BATTERY SUCKS. HARDLY STAYS ONE DAY IF WE DIDN'T DONE ANYTHING WITHOUT RECEIVING CALLS.
      
      ------------------------------
      
      SOME PLUS POINTS
      
      1] ITS BRIGHTNESS IS JUST AMAZING. I REALLY ENJOYED NEW ""JISM  TRAILER ON IT. (BUT IN LEGGY CONDITION. NOT VERY SMOOTHLY)
      
      2] BEATSAUDIO IS GOOD. AS PER MY THINK. COZ I DON'T HAVE ALOT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AUDIO. BUT ITS GOOD. HEADPHONES TOO.
      
      3] 3.7"" SCREEN LOOKS SO BIG. GOOD TO SEE ANY VIDEO OR READING EBOOK.
      
      ________________________________
      
      
      AND NOW I WILL SUGGEST THIS PHONE FOR PEOPLE (AGE&GT;30) . THEY DO WITH THEIR PHONE IN SMALL CASE. BUT NOT FOR YOUNGSTERS OR COLLEGE BOYZ. COZ WE GUYS DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WITH OUR PHONE. AND SOMETIMES IT GETS STUCKED. SO
      
      GOOD FOR MID AGE PEOPLE LIKE BUSINESSMENS.
      
      BAD FOR COLLEGE GUYS.
      
      THANKS."
HTC One V T320,2,"I HAD A NOKIA LUMIA 710. THE PHONE WAS SUPER SPEEDY BUT BECAUSE OF THE OS AND THE BLUETOOTH LIMITATION, I DECIDED TO TRADE IT FOR HTC ONE V. ANDROID IS DEFINITELY BETTER. BUT THIS DEVICE LACKS THE RESPONSIVENESS OF LUMIA. IT MAKES ME MISS MY LUMIA.  IT IS VERY SLUGGISH. AND THE CAMERA IS BAD."
HTC One V T320,2,"I HAVE BEEN USING IT SINCE 2 WEEKS NOW AND MAN THIS PHONE IS VERY MUCH GOOD.,WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A 5 STAR IF IT HAD SECONDARY CAMERA   AND AT LEAST 1.5 GHZ PROCESSOR..TRANSITION EFFECTS ARE GOOD AND BEATS AUDIO IS JUS AMAZING CAMERA QUALITY IS AWSOME AND EVERYTHING      ELSE IS JUS GOOD IN ITS PLACE.."
HTC One V T320,2,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR 15 MONTHS NOW. I BOUGHT IT FROM A RETAIL SHOP.
      
      PROS:
      
      1.THE PHONE LOOKS GOOD AND THE BATTERY LASTS A DAY.
      
      2. THE CAMERA IS ABOVE AVERAGE AND
      
      3. THE SCREEN IS GOOD.
      
      4. BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      CONS:
      
      1. THE PHONE I BOUGHT COULD NEVER GET GOOD RECEPTION AND THE HTC GUYS TOOK 3 WEEKS TO REPLACE IT HERE IN CHANDIGARH.
      
      2. IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO CALL OR MESSAGE ANYONE WITH THIS PHONE BECAUSE IT CAN TAKE UP TO 2-3 MINUTES FOR THE CONTACT APP TO RESPOND.
      
      3. THIS PHONE WILL REALLY TEST YOUR PATIENCE.
      
      DELETING MY CONTACTS SO THAT I NOW ONLY HAVE THE VERY ESSENTIAL CONTACTS HAVE HELPED A BIT WITH THE CONTACT APP.
      
      P.S. THIRD PARTY CONTACT APPS ARE SLOW TOO ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      INSTALLING CUSTOM ROMS HELP A BIT BUT NOT MUCH."
HTC One V T320,2,"I JUST GOT WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR.GOOD CAMERA,AMAZING UI,GOOD GAMING,GOOD BATTERY BACKUP.
      
      
      BUT SOMETHINGS NEED TO WORK ON LIKE FRONT CAMERA FOR VIDEO CALLING,MORE MEMORY(AS THE ANDROID 4.0 OS EATS UP ALMOST 3GB FROM THE AVAILABLE 4GB MEMORY).
      
      
      GREAT PHONE ON ANDROID 4.0 COMING ON THIS PRICE."
HTC One V T320,2,"I MUST SAY THE MAIN FEATURE THAT MADE ME BUY THIS PHONE WAS ITS PRICE. GETTING SUCH FEATURES COMBINED WITH LOOKS AND DESIGN AT THIS COST WAS A REAL PLUS. BUT NOW AFTER HAVING USED IT FOR 2 MONTHS I DONT FEEL THE PHONE WAS WORTH THE MONEY. HERE ARE THE PROS AND CONS:
      
      
      CONS FIRST:
      
      1. HTC HASNT RELEASED ANY OFFICIAL STATEMENT AS TO WHEN THE JELLYBEAN UPGRADE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ONE V(JELLYBEAN HAS BEEN CONFIRMED FOR ONE X AND S THOUGH). SO ONE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO ROOT THE PHONE TO UPGRADE TO NEWER ANDROID VERSIONS.
      
      2. THIS PHONE'S BATTERY NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED REALLY CAREFULLY, IM NO EXPERT WITH ANDROID DEVICES BUT THIS IS WHAT I DISCOVERED. IN THE FIRST MONTH OF USE, I HAD BEEN CHARGING THE PHONE IRREGULARLY (AND EVEN WHEN I WOULD, I WOULDNT DO IT COMPLETELY MOST OF THE TIME) LEADING TO THESE OBSERVATIONS:
      
      A) PHONE WOULD GET HEATED UP RAPIDLY WHILE PLAYING ANY GAME, IN ABOUT 45 MINS.
      
      B) BATTERY WOULDNT LAST MORE THAN 24 HRS.
      
      C) YELLOW DOTS WOULD APPEAR AT TIMES ON THE RIGHT CORNERS OF THE SCREEN.
      
      THEN SINCE THE PAST MONTH IV KEPT A PROPER CHARGING ROUTINE FOR THIS PHONE (DRAIN COMPLETELY, THEN CHARGE COMPLETELY WITHOUT RUNNING ANY APPS IN BETWEEN OR DISCONTINUING CHARGING), AND I HAVNT SEEN ANY OF THE ABOVE. THE BATTERY NORMALLY LASTS 48HRS WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH.
      
      3. A MAJOR BUG I DISCOVERED WITH THIS PHONE WAS WITH ITS CONTACTS. THIS THING HAS HAPPENED A NO. OF TIMES WHEN I WOULD ADD A CONTACT, SAVE IT TO THE PHONE(OR SIM) AND THEN WHEN I SEARCH FOR IT LATER IT WOULDNT BE THERE(EVEN AFTER SELECTING ALL PHONEBOOK OPTIONS FB,WHATSAPP,PHONE,SIM,ETC)
      
      4. ONLY 1 GB OF THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER AND NOT 4.
      
      5. NOT ALL LIVE WALLPAPERS ARE SUPPORTED ON THIS PHONE.
      
      6. SEVERAL DEFAULT APPS ARE TOO PRIMITVE LIKE MUSIC PLAYER, OFFICE, ETC(THR R ALWAYS ALTERNATIVES THOUGH)
      
      7. CAMERA DOESNT WORK TOO WELL IN DARK.
      
      
      PROS ARE ANYWAY MENTIONED IN THE FEATURES AND IN PREVIOUS REVEIEWS - SLEEK DESIGN, BEATS AUDIO SPEAKERS, EXPANDABLE MEMORY, ETC).
      
      
      THE PHONE IS BEST SUITED FOR LIGHT USERS, TECH SAVVY GUYS WOULD KNOW NOT TO GO FOR THIS. THUMBS DOWN FROM ME."
HTC One V T320,2,"I WAS WAITING FOR THIS PHONE AND WHEN I BOUGHT IT WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.THE PHONE LOOKS GOOD, BRILLIANT SCREEN RESOLUTION BUT THE MOMENT YOU GOT CONTACTS TO DIAL A NUMBER, YOU ARE THERE.... TO FIND AND CALL A NUMBER IT TAKES MORE THAN 10 SECS AND SOMETIMES MORE.... NOW I AM LOOKING FOR A GUY TO SELL THIS ONE OFF.
      
      
      GOOD FEATURES AND GOOD CAMERA, GOOD SOUNDS ETC ARE IMPORTANT BUT THE BASICS SHOULD BE GOOD AS WELL.
      
      
      OVER ALL I AM NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THE PHONE AFTER PAYING SO MUCH."
HTC One V T320,2,"THIS IS A NICE PHONE WHICH HAS THE FACILITIES WHAT A SMART PHONE SHOULD HAVE, BUT IT FAILS TO HAVE A BASIC FACILITY THAT ALL PHONES HAVE - STRONG SIGNAL COVERAGE. YOU CAN DO A GOOGLE SEARCH TO FIND OUT THIS PROBLEM, AS WELL.
      
      
      ALSO, PLEASE DON'T BE DECEIVED BY THE ""BEATS AUDIO"". THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL IN THAT, AS THE HEADPHONES, THEY GIVE YOU ARE TERRIBLY ORDINARY, AND DO NOT JUSTIFY THE HIGH END PRICE OF THE PHONE, AND THEY WILL GO ""FHAT"" IN A FEW MONTHS LIKE MINE DID."
HTC One V T320,1,AFTER I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IT STOPPED WORKING IN 40 DAYS. HTC REPLACED MY SET WITH NEW ONE. BUT AGAIN IT STOPPED WORKING. I'M TOTALLY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS PHONE. THEY SAID AGAIN THEY'LL REPLACE THE PHONE BUT STILL DIDNT DO IT.
HTC One V T320,1,BOUGHT IT WITH MANY EXPECTATIONS BUT ITS A FAILURE ONE GETS MANY PROBLEMS IT GOES OFF SUDDENLY AND DOES NOT TURN ON AND IT TURNS IN TO A VIBRATOR EVEN ITS TURNED OFF SO I WENT TO THE SERVICE CENTRE AND I WAS SHOCKED BY THE INFORMATION HE GAVE ME ALMOST OF 65 TO 70 HANDSETS ARE ON COMPLAINTS FROM THAT SINGLE SERVICE CENTRE SO I SUGGEST DONT BUY IT
HTC One V T320,1,BOUGHT THE PHONE LAST MAY 2012 FOR ITS LATEST OS IT LAGGED FOR GAMING APPLICATIONS SUDDENLY AFTER 7 MONTHS THE PHONE WAS DEAD I THINK ITS BATTERY PROBLEM  I TRIED ALL TECHNIQUES FROM HTC SITE TO RESTORE BUT IT DID NOT WORKED GAVE FOR REPAIRS IN JANUARY 2013 SINCE THEN THEY HAVE REPAIRING THE PHONE GIVING SILLY REASONS IT ALREADY 4 MONTHS AND ITS WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY TO BUY HTC   AND I STILL DID NOT GET MY PHONE BACK - INSTEAD OF HTC BEST BUY MICROMAX PHONES BUT DONT BUY HTC
HTC One V T320,1,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE LAST YEAR IN APRIL.

HTC One V T320,1,"FRIENDS,
      
      THIS IS A HONEST AND REAL REVIEW I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO BUY HTC ONE V.
      
      AS MANY OF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS PRODUCT HAS LOT OF MANUFACTURING DEFECTS.THIS EVEN COMPANY PEOPLE DO AGREE.LET'S TAKE MY EXAMPLE I BOUGHT THE PHONE 5 MONTHS BACK INITIALLY AFTER GOING BY ITS LOOK,SCREEN QUALITY AND ALL THOSE FANCY STUFF I WAS VERY HAPPY AND I DID FEEL FANTASTIC.
      
      BUT NOW MY MOTHERBOARD GOT SCREWED UP!CAN YOU IMAGINE A NEW PHONE FROM HTC BRAND WILL STOP WORKING?WHEN A NOKIA SIMPLE PHONE WILL WORK FOR YEARS!
      
      AND I CAME TO KNOW FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE THAT THEY GOT HELL LOT OF COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM AND THEY HAVEN'T RECALLED THE PRODUCT AS THEY DON;T CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER'S MONEY.
      
      IN CASE YOUR MOTHER BORAD FAILS AFTER WARRANTY PERIOD YOU HAVE TO PAY 10K FOR REPAIR.
      
      AND FROM MY SIDE I WOULD SAY DONT GO WITH LOOKS AND DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT .PLEASE SPREAD THIS WORD AND LET SAVE OUR FRIENDS FROM HTC ONE V'S FRAUD!"
HTC One V T320,1,"GO FOR SONY XPERIA L. IT HAS 1 GHZ DUAL COREPROCESSOR,BIGGER SCREEN,ADRENO 305,1 GB RAM,8 MP CAM,ANDROID 4.1 N JUST FOR 17K.

      ONLY AFTER 20 DAYS WHILE I WAS MAKING A CALL IT BECAME DEAD AND TEMPERATURE OF HANDSET ROSE TO 50 DEGREE CELSIUS.I HAD TO KEEP THE HANDSET ON TABLE AND TOOK ONE HOUR TO COOL DOWM.
      
      
      I THEN TOOK IT TO MODEL TOWN SERVICE STATION WHICH WAS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY FOR 3-4 DAYS { TVS E SERVE }
      
      
      CUSTOME CARE HAD NO CLUES AND JUST TRIED TO CONSOLE ME RATHER THAN COMMITING TIMELINES.
      
      
      MY REPAIRED HANDSET WAS GIVEN AFER 15 DAYS WITH DISPLAY AND BATTERY REPLACED WITH NEW IMIE NUMBER.
      
      
      HTC DUMPS DEFECTIVE HANDSETS IN INDIA AS THERE IS NOBODY IN GOVERNMENT TO TRACK THINGS."
HTC One V T320,1,"I BOUGHT THE PHONE WHEN IT CAME OUT FIRST NOT FROM HERE THOUGH
      
      ITS HORRIBLE
      
      I DONT KNOW WHY OR HOW ITS SO PRICEY EVEN NOW ITS ONE OF THE WORST PHONES EVER
      
      IN-FACT ITS NOT A PHONE
      
      A BASIC PHONE IS REQUIRED TO DO THE FOLLOWING
      
      CALLING-MESSAGING-VEIWING YOUR CONTACTS
      
      BY THE TIME ANY OF THIS THREE NATIVE APPS OPENED ON MY PHONE I WISH I COULD THROW IT
      
      IT TOOK A MINIMUM OF 10 SEC FOR EITHER OF IT TO OPEN
      
      
      AND A FRIEND OF MINE HAD BOUGHT THIS SAME PHONE SAME PROBLEM
      
      SO STAY ATLEAST A MILE AWAY FROM THIS PHONE"
HTC One V T320,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2 MONTHS BACK. BEFORE THAT I WAS USING MY OFFICE BLACKBERRY. SO I HAVE JUST ENTERED INTO THIS TOUCH-BASED SMARTPHONE WORLD.
      
      
      SO, YOU KNOW THIS THING ABOUT SHARUKH OR AKSHAY KUMAR MOVIES RIGHT. THE OPENINGS WOULD BE GOOD, AND THEY SAY THE COLLECTIONS ARE IN CRORES. SO YOU ENTER THE MOVIE HALL, BUY YOURSELF POPCORN, AND START WATCHING IT. THE MOVIE REACHES ITS CLIMAX, THE CREDITS ARE RUNNING AND YOU STEP OUT. NOW YOU FEEL LIKE SHIT. THIS IS THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE YOU WILL GET WITH THIS PHONE. THERE IS NO AFTER-TASTE.
      
      
      MY EXPERIENCES :
      
      PRESS THE PEOPLE (CONTACTS) BUTTON - MAKE SOME TEA - COME BACK AND CHECK YOUR CONTACTS LIST
      
      PRESS THE EMAIL BUTTON - IRON YOUR SHIRT - THEN START READING YOUR EMAIL.
      
      PRESS THE SMS BUTTON - CHECK OUT ALL THE TV CHANNELS - THEN REPLY TO THE SMS.
      
      
      BOTTOMLINE : THIS PHONE IS SLOW. JUST TOO SLOW. INCREDIBLY SLOW EVEN TO OPERATE. EVEN SLOWER WHEN  THE NUMBER OF APPS START INCREASING (I NEVER USE HEAVY WEIGHT APPS LIKE GAMES, ETC).
      
      
      THE CAMERA IS GOOD. OF COURSE I AM USING THE ANDROID APPS. BUT SPEED IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR - AND THIS PHONE FAILS MISERABLY HERE.
      
      
      CONCLUSION : IF A PHONE CAN'T GET THE BASIC FEATURES RIGHT - THEN IT IS NOT WORTH IT. BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO USE ONLY THE ""SMART"" PART OF THE PHONE, AND NOT THE BASIC FEATURES."
HTC One V T320,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ABOUT A MONTH BACK - POSSIBLY THE WORST BUY I HAVE EVER MADE. POSSIBLY I WAS UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET A FAULTY MODEL, BUT FROM THE REVIEWS HERE AND ELSEWHERE, THE PROBLEMS I HAVE FACED SEEM PRETTY COMMON.
      
      THE PHONE SUFFERS FROM TERRIBLE NETWORK ISSUES, I USE A VODAFONE PREPAID SIM THAT HAS WORKED FINE ON EVERY OTHER HANDSET I HAVE USED. WITH THIS ONE, THE SIGNAL KEEPS DISAPPEARING. AT ONE POINT, IT WOULD HAPPEN EVERY TIME I MADE A PHONE CALL, 5 SECONDS INTO THE CONVERSATION. IT RECONNECTS ONLY AFTER THE PHONE IS RESTARTED (THAT TAKES AROUND 2-3 MINS BY THE WAY), AND OFTEN MULTIPLE RESTARTS ARE REQUIRED BEFORE IT CAN RECONNECT TO THE NETWORK.
      
      THE OTHER WAY TO RECOVER SIGNAL IS TO TOGGLE FLIGHT MODE ON AND THEN OFF BUT AGAIN, THIS IS NOT VERY RELIABLE. AND EVEN WORSE, ATTEMPTING TO TOGGLE FLIGHT MODE OFTEN CAUSES THE PHONE TO HANG AND RESTART. THIS BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND PROBLEM - FREQUENT, RANDOM RESTARTS; HAPPENED WHILE SHOOTING VIDEO, TAKING PHOTOS, AFTER SENDING SMS, WHILE MAKING A PHONE CALL.
      
      SO I TOOK IT TO THE HTC SERVICE CENTER IN KOLKATA. THE FIRST TIME, THEY FLASHED THE PHONE BUT THAT DIDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I WENT BACK THE NEXT DAY AND THIS TIME THEY KEPT IT FOR 4 DAYS AND REPLACED SOME COMPONENTS. AGAIN, THIS DIDN'T HELP. FURTHERMORE, THE REPAIRED PHONE WAS NOTICEABLY SLOWER THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE. FOR EXAMPLE, BEFORE REPAIR I COULD PLAY TEMPLE RUN 2 WITH NO LAG OR FREEZES. NOT SO AFTER TEH REPAIR.
      
      AT THE END OF THIS, I HAD HAD ENOUGH. I ASKED FOR A REPLACEMENT AND AFTER FOUR DAYS OF NEEDLESS DALLYING, THEY FINALLY AGREED AND SAID THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS.
      
      THE 10 DAYS ARE ALMOST OVER AND HTC HAS NOT YET GIVEN ME ANY UPDATE ON WHEN AND IF I CAN EXPECT A DELIVERY. A CALL TO THE HTC SERVICE CENTER IN KOLKATA RESULTS IN A RUDE REPLY ""WE DO NOT HAVE ANY NEWS. PLEASE CALL HTC CUSTOMER CARE."" HTC CUSTOMER CARE IS SLIGHTLY MORE POLITE BUT EQUALLY UNHELPFUL.
      
      
      EVEN IF THE REPLACED PHONE WORKS FINE, WHICH I SERIOUSLY DOUBT, I AM NOT BUYING HTC EVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE."
HTC One V T320,1,I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND WITHIN A SPAN OF 2 WEEKS THE DISPLAY BECAME TOO LIGHT. I WENT TO THE SERVICE STATION AND THEY KEPT IT FOR AROUND 15 DAYS CHANGED THE DISPLAY AND IT STILL DID NOT WORK . THEY THEN REPLACED IT WITH A NEW PHONE. I GOT THE NEW PHONE FROM HTC AND AGAIN IN A WEEK THE DISPLAY STARTED TO FLICKER AND GRADUALLY THE ENTIRE PHONE WENT DEAD. I WENT TO THE SERVICE CENTRE AND THEY SAID THAT WATER WAS LOCKED INSIDE WHICH WAS NOT TRUE. THEY ARGUED AND SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A FURTHER 4000 RUPEES FOR THE DISPLAY. THAT WAS NOT ALL. THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD OPEN THE PHONE AND IF THERE WERE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS THEN I WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE. I WAS REALLY ANGRY AND IRRITATED. THE WORST MANAGED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I COULD NOT EVEN SEE THE MANAGER AS THEY SAID THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY MANAGERS THERE.THE FEATURES OF THE ANDROID 4 IS AMAZING. BATTERY BACKUP IS OKAY BUT I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE.. I WOULD ALWAYS REPENT BUYING THIS PHONE. I AM TOTALLY STUCK NOW ... JUST A PIECE OF CRAP IT IS.
HTC One V T320,1,"I DELETED MY INITIAL 4 STAR REVIEW TO POST THIS INSTEAD - MY ONE V DIED LAST WEEK (PART OF THE MAR 2012 MANUFACTURING LOT, BOUGHT IN APRIL). I HAVE GIVEN IT TO THE SERVICE CENTRE AND HOPE TO GET A DOA CERTIFICATE SO THAT I CAN EXCHANGE IT FOR A DIFFERENT PHONE THAT WORKS.
      
      
      IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, CHECK OUT THE OTHER 1 STAR REVIEWS HERE, OR TRY SEARCHING GOOGLE FOR TERMS LIKE ""HTC ONE V DEAD"", ""HTC ONE V NOT TURNING ON"" &AMP; ""HTC ONE V BRICKED"".
      
      
      THE PHONE SEEMS TO HAVE A NASTY TENDENCY TO JUST DIE - NOT TURNING ON OR CHARGING, SO THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE PURCHASING IT. THE ISSUE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITH THE INITIAL MANUFACTURING LOT, AS THE PRICES OF THE PHONE WAS IN THE 16K RANGE IN JUNE BEFORE GOING OUT OF STOCK, AND THEN RETURNING TO THE 18K+ PRICE POINT.
      
      
      EITHER WAY, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. NOW, I ONLY HOPE THE 2 OTHER PERSONS WHO BOUGHT THE PHONE ON MY RECOMMENDATION DON'T MEET THE SAME FATE.
      
      
      UPDATE (MAR 2013): IT SEEMS THAT SOME PEOPLE (INCLUDING A COUPLE OF PERSONS WHO BOUGHT THE PHONE ON MY RECOMMENDATION) ARE ALSO FACING ISSUES WITH THE CONTACTS MANAGER ON THE PHONE, AND IT HAS A TENDENCY TO HANG AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE PHONE CALLS."
HTC One V T320,1,"I HAD PURCHASED THE SAME MOBILE DATED 22 /10/2012 THROUGH FLIPKART , WHICH WAS FAULTY DUE TO SOFTWARE PROBLEM &AMP; REPLACED BY FLIPKART. &AMP; THE SAME SECOND NEW ONE ONE MOBILE UNDER WARRANTY WHICH WAS COMPLETELY DEAD ,WHICH WAS GIVEN TO SERVICE CENTER,BUT PHONE WAS NOT PROPERLY REPAIRED &AMP; NEW PROBLEM WAS GENERATED SIMCARD SLOT NOT WORKING . THEN AGAIN 3RD TIME GIVEN TO SERVICE CENTER &AMP; NOT GETTING ANY POSITIVE RESPONSE &AMP; ONLY APOLOGIZE WORDS USED IN EMAIL REPLY .WHICH IS INDICATING SWEET POISON GIVEN TO VALUED CUSTOMER.
      
      MY SELF 1000% DISSATISFIED WITH THE COMPANY POLICY WHAT SO EVER MAY BE SELLS &AMP; AFTER SERVICE POLICY.

HTC One V T320,1,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE OCTOBER 2012.WHEN I BOUGHT IT FROM FLIPKART JUST AFTER 20 DAYS IT STARTED GIVING NETWORK DROP AND RESTARTING PROBLEM.I REPORTED TO FLIPKART AND THEY REPLACED THE PHONE. BUT IN NEW PHONE AGAIN I FACED THE SAME ISSUE.I WENT TO SERVICE CENTER AND THEY REPLACED MY SOFTWARE AND RE-INSTALLED THE OS.BUT THE PROBLEM DIDN'T SOLVED.I STARTED GETTING THE SIMILAR PROBLEM, I MAILED TO HTC AND CALLED TRHEM ALSO.THEY SAID AGAIN GO TO SERVICE CENTER ,THEY WILL TALK TO THE.
      
      NEXT TIME WHEN I WENT THEY REPLACED THE MOTHERBOARD AND GAVE ME THE PPHONE AFTER ONE WEEK/.BUT THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTING.NEXT TIME WHEN I COMPLAINED THET SAID ITS PROBLEM WITH YOUR SIM CARD ,I HANGED IT BUT PROBLEM STILL THERE.I HAVE TRIED AIRTEL,VODAFONE AND TATA DOCOMO SIM BUT ALL THE SIM HAVING SAME PROBLEM WITH HTC ONE V.SAME SIM CARD WORKD FINE IN OTHER HANDSET.
      
      
      WORST THING IS THAT I HAVE TALKED TO HTC REPRESENTATIVE ATLEAST 10-15 TIMES AND HAVE VISITED SERVICE CENTER 5 TIMES BUT NO-ONE IS GIVING ME ANY SOLUTION.ESCALATION TEAM TELLS ME TO GO TO SERVICE CENTER THET WILL TALK TO THEM AND SERVICE CENTER'S INCHARGE SAYING THAT WE HAVE DONE ALL THE THING FROM OUR END .
      
      
      PHONE IS AWESOME IF IT WORKS FINE  BUT VERY POOR SERVICE BY HTC  SO PLEASE DON'T BUY HTC."
HTC One V T320,1,"I HAVE NOT BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART SO THE REVIEW HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FLIPKART BUT ABOUT THE MODEL.
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR CLOSE TO 10 MONTHS NOW &AMP; I AM PISSED TO HELL BECAUSE BASIC FEATURE OF A PHONE I.E. CALLS &AMP; MESSAGES DONT WORK IN THIS PHONE. AND SURPRISE OH SURPRISE THIS IS DUE TO SOME CONTACT STORAGE BUG WITH THIS MODEL.
      
      AS PER FLIPKART POLICIES I CAN NOT POST ANY LINK. BUT DO A GOOGLE FOR ""HTC ONE V CONTACT STORAGE PROBLEM"" AND FIRST LINK WHICH SHOWS UP IS FROM HTCONEFORUM WHICH GIVES FULL DETAIL ON HOW THIS ISSUE IS PERSISTENT WITH ALMOST EVERY USER OF THIS PHONE (IT HAS SOLUTION AS WELL FINALLY).
      
      IT HANGS EVERY NOW &AMP; THEN YOU TRY TO MAKE A CALL OR SEND A MESSAGE. INFINITE CRASH REPORTS SENT TO HTC BUT DOES NOT HELP. FINALLY FOUND THE SOLUTION IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED LINK &AMP; IT WORKS FINE NOW.
      
      PROBLEM IS THAT HTC HAS NOT BOTHERED TO RELEASE ANY FIX FOR THIS ISSUE DESPITE IT BEING AN ISSUE WITH ALL REGIONS ACROSS WORLD.
      
      ONE THING IS CLEAR THAT I WILL NEVER EVER GO FOR AN HTC PHONE. WONT EVEN RECOMMEND IT TO MY ENEMIES AS WELL.
      
      OTHER FEATURES ARE FINE. DONT GIVE A DAMN ANYMORE WHAT THIS PHONE DOES WITH ALL THOSE TECHNICAL FEATURES AS SMARTPHONE DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO OFFER FOR PHONE. SO IT WAS NOT A SMART DECISION ANYWAY.
      
      
      STICK TO SAMSUNG FOLKS IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR ANDROID DEVICES. OTHERWISE TRY IPHONE OR NOKIA FOR WINDOWS. I AM DONE WITH ANDROID DUE TO THIS PHONE &AMP; MY NEXT PHONE WD BE EITHER IPHONE OR WINDOWS.

HTC One V T320,1,"I MUST WARN YOU BEFORE BUYING ANY HTC PHONE! THE KIND OF SERVICE I HAVE RECEIVED IS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING CONSIDERING IT IS SUCH A BIG BRAND!
      
      
      IN THE PAST 1 YEAR THAT I HAVE OWNED MY HTC DESIRE Z, I HAVE HAD TO GIVE IT FOR SERVICING 2 TIMES. FIRST TIME THEY TOOK A MONTH TO REPAIR AND THE SECOND TIME IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN 2 MONTHS AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PHONE!
      
      
      THEIR NETWORK IS SO BAD THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE PHONE. THEY HAVE OUTSOURCED THEIR FRONT-END SERVICE TO THE MOST USELESS PEOPLE WHO NEVER COOPERATE. THE CUSTOMER CARE IS JUST SOME CALL CENTER WHO SWEET-TALK YOU INTO BELIEVING YOU WILL GET THE PHONE WHILE THE ACTUAL SERVICE CENTER IS SOMEWHERE IN BANGALORE AND EVERYONE BLUNTLY REFUSES TO PROVIDE THE CONTACT NUMBER FOR THAT!!
      
      
      I HAVE WASTED SO MUCH TIME &AMP; MONEY ON MAKING CALLS TRYING TO FOLLOW UP AND I HAVE EVEN HAD TO GO TILL THEIR HIGHER MANAGEMENT BUT ITS OF NO USE...
      
      
      IF YOU ARE BUYING HTC, THEN YOU'RE JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE."
HTC One V T320,1,"I PAID RS.18000/- AND BOUGHT A HTC ONE V PHONE, BUT WITHIN 2 MONTHS IT STARTED RE-STARTING AND AUTO SHUT DOWN. IT WAS FRUSTERATING. BUT THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE THE PHONE AS, GUESS WHAT?? - THE REPLACEMENT WARRENTY IS ONLY FOR 15 DAYS!! THE CUSTOMER CARE PERSON JUST KEPT REPEATING THAT I HAVE NO CHANCE OF GETTING THE PHONE REPAIRED, BUT CAN GO ON REPAIRING IT FOR 1 YEAR - TILL THE TIME THE WARRENTY EXPIRES. THE CUSTOMER CARE PERSONNEL INFORM ME UNOFFICIALLY THAT THEY ARE GETTING SEVERAL HTC PHONE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM - AND WHILE I WAS THERE ITSELF SOME 5-7 PEOPLE CAME IN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THE PHONES MANUFACTURED IN APRIL-MAY 2012 IS HAVING THE MAXIMUM PROBLEM. BE VERY CAREFUL WHILE BUYING HTC. ANOTHER THING IS THE RECIEVER RANGE IS VERY BAD. I CAN VOUCH FOR THIS BECAUSE IN THE SAME PLACE (MY HOME), MY OTHER NOKIA E5 SHOWS 4 BARS, WHILE THE HTC WILL SHOW ONLY ONE BAR - A SEVERAL TIMES WITHOUT RANGE. I READ RECENTLY IN THE INDIAN EXPRESS PAPER THAT ONE PERSON HAS GOT A REFUND OF HIS AMOUNT BY THE CONSUMER COURT BECAUSE HE WAS FACING THE SAME PROBLEM, AND I AM ALSO PLANNING TO PROCEED IN THE SAME WAY."
HTC One V T320,1,"ITS ONE OF THE PATHETIC PHONE I HAVE EVER SEEN.I BOUGHT ONE AND WITHIN FEW DAYS THERE WAS SOME DEFECT.THANKS TO FLIPKART,I GOT IT REPLACED,NOW AFTER 5 WEEKS MY PHONE GOT SWITCHED OFF AND ITS NOT AT ALL WAKING UP.SO YOU CAN IMAGINE TWO HORRIBLE EXPERIENCES WITHIN MONTH AND HALF.AFTER PAYING AROUND 18K ONE EXPECT PHONE TO RUN FOR ATLEAST FEW YEARS WITHOUT ANY ISSUE.
      
      
      BUT THIS PHONE DOES NOT EVEN RUN FEW MONTHS."
HTC One V T320,1,"LOOK WISE A VERY ATTRACTIVE PHONE BUT VERY POOR PERFORMANCE,POOR BATTERY , COMES WITH A VERY LOW INTERNAL MEMORY ,  KEEPS HANGING , SUDDENLY PHONE WENT DEAD AND NOW WITH SERVICE CENTRE , HOPE TO GET THE PHONE BACK SOON."
HTC One V T320,1,"NOT WORTH BUYING....
      
      PROCESSOR IS VERY SLOW.. VERY VERY SLOW
      
      MANY TIMES I AM NOT ABLE TO CALL
      
      IN MY OPINION... ITS THE WORST PHONE IN THE MARKET

HTC One V T320,1,"PURCHASED A HTC ONE V IN AUG 2012 , THE FIRST 3 MONTHS WERE WITHOUT AN ISSUE, BUT PAST 6 MONTHS THE PHONE IS GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY. HAVE ALREADY SERVICE IT ONCE , WORKED WELL FOR A FEW DAYS &AMP; NOW BACK TO THE SAME PROBLEMS. HANGS A LOT, TOUCH SCREEN IS GETTING LESS RESPONSIVE. DON'T EVEN USE GAMES . PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY BY NOT BUYING A HTC. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY"
HTC One V T320,1,THE LCD PANEL SIMPLY WENT DEAD AFTER TWO MONTHS OF NORMAL USE. HAD A TOUGH TIME GETTING IT TO THEIR COLLECTION CENTER AS THERE ARE NO CENTERS IN SOUTH MUMBAI. THE SMALL PLACE IN DADAR HAD ONLY ONE LANDLINE WHICH WAS FOREVER ENGAGED OR OUT OF ORDER. MADE THREE TRIPS. THEY PROMISED TO REPAIR THE PIECE IN 15 DAYS. LATER ON THEIR CALL CENTER PEOPLE CALLED TO SAY THAT THEY WOULD REPAIR IT QUICKLY. THE DISPLAY WAS NOT VERY BRIGHT TO START WITH. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CELL PHONE DEVELOP A MAJOR FAULT LIKE THIS. THE PHONE SHOULD BE REPLACED BUT THEY ARE JUST PROMISING TO REPAIR WHICH MEANS IT MAY COLLAPSE AGAIN ONE DAY AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRES! THE PLASTIC USED IN THE BODY CONSTRUCTION IS ALSO OF POOR QUALITY AND DEVELOPS SCRATCHES AND STAINS QUICKLY. I AM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE AND SAW MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS COMING IN WITH NEW HTC ONE V PROBLEMS. I WOULD GIVE THIS MODEL 5 THUMBS DOWN!
HTC One V T320,1,THE PHONE IS TOO SLOW. YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR TOO MANY SECONDS FOR APPLICATIONS TO GET STARTED. THERE IS A HUGE LAG ON GAMES LIKE TEMPLE DOOM AND NINJUMP. CAMARA IS GOOD. ODDLY GETS HOT ON USING MAPS AND CAMARA.
HTC One V T320,1,"THIS PHONE DOESNT HAVE A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, IT ALSO HAS COMPLAINTS ABOUT SIGNAL ISSUES AND CALL QUALITY.
      
      
      SO PLEASE CHECK THESE ISSUE OUT BEFORE YOU BUY. OTHER PHONES WITH DUAL CORE PROCESSORS AND BETTER CALL QUALITY AND BATTERY LIFE ARE AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE WITH THE SAME PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      ALSO MANY MANY PHONES WILL BE LAUNCHING IN THE NEXT ONE TO TWO MONTHS WITH BETTER SPECS IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE ."
HTC One V T320,1,VERY BAD CAMERA ...MY OLD NOKIA PHONE WITH 2 MP CAMERA DID MUCH BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN THIS ONE V...AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH HTC...SAMSUNG GALAXY ACE AND EXPERIA SOLA WILL DEFENITELY WORKS THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THAN THIS ONE V ....SO PLS OPT ANOTHER PHONES
HTC One V T320,1,"WITH ALL THE LOADED FEATURES, THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A PERFECT LOW-RANGE ANDROID PHONE. BUT DON'T BE FOOLED BY JUST THAT.
      
      
      1. THE PHONE INTERNAL MEMORY IS REALLY BAD. WITH THE ANDROID 4.0 OS, YOU WOULD EXPECT ALL KINDS OF APPS TO FUNCTION ON IT BRILLIANTLY. BUT THIS IS SHORT LIVED. EVEN WITH A DECENT NUMBER OF APPS INSTALLED, THE PHONE BECOME SLUGGISH TAKING ALMOST A MINUTE FOR A NEW WINDOW TO OPEN.
      
      
      2. DO NOT EVER BUY A PHONE WHOSE BATTERY YOU CAN""T REMOVE! APART FROM THE SIM CARD AND MEMORY CARD SLOT, EVERYTHING ELSE IS BUILT IN. SO WHEN THE PHONE HANGS, YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO RECOVER. YOU CAN'T JUST REBOOT IT.
      
      
      3. BATTERY PROBLEM - RECENTLY, I FORGOT TO CHARGE MY PHONE AT NIGHT AND WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING TO FIND THE PHONE COMPLETELY DISCHARGED AND SWITCHED OFF (QUITE NATURAL). SO I PUT IT FOR CHARGING AND IT WASN'T CHARGING PROPERLY. FOR A WHOLE DAY IT WAS HOOKED TO THE CHARGER BUT THE PHONE WAS STILL OFF. I CONTACTED THE NEAREST SERVICE CENTER AND THEY SAID THE BATTERY WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED COZ IT WAS COMPLETELY DISCHARGED. HENCE, IT DIED. (?????). MY PHONE WAS ANYWAY IN WARRANTY (7 MONTHS), SO I GAVE IT TO THEM TO FIX IT AND 10 DAYS LATER I GET A MAIL FROM THE COMPANY THAT MY PHONE IS OUT OF WARRANTY BECAUSE OF 'CUSTOMER MISUSE/ABUSE' AND GAVE A QUOTATION FOR RS. 8640 FOR THE REPAIRS. SINCE EVERYTHING IS BUILT-IN, THEY CAN'T JUST REPLACE THE BATTERY, HENCE THEY CHARGE YOU FOR REPLACING ALL THE OTHER COMPONENTS AS WELL (WHICH YOU NEVER REALLY SPOILT IN THE 1ST PLACE!!)
      
      
      4. WARRANTY STATEMENT FAULTY - IF YOU READ THE WARRATY STATEMENT IT CLEARLY SAYS THAT THERE 1 YEAR WARRANTY FOR THE PHONE AND 1 YEAR FOR THE ACCESSORIES. 2 MONTHS AFTER MY PHONE GOT SPOILT, MY EARPHONE CONKED OUT AS WELL. I WENT BACK TO THE CENTER, BUT THEY VERY RUDELY  INFORMED ME THAT SINCE THE PHONE IS OUT OF WARRANTY THE ACCESSORIES ALSO CEASE TO BE COVERED BY IT. THIS STATEMENT IS NOWHERE PRESENT IN THE WARRANTY STATEMENT, WHICH IS MISLEADING (YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE STATEMENT ON THE HTC INDIA SITE)
      
      
      OVERALL, THE HTC SERVICE IS REALLY BAD. THE LOW PRICE OF THE PHONE AND THE FEATURES IS WHAT PROMPTED ME TO BUY THIS. BUT THIS PHONE WILL NOT LAST YOU MORE THAN A YEAR. THIS IS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND OF SOME OF MY FRIENDS."
HTC One V T320,1,"WITH MUCH EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM I HEADED FOR THE PLANET-M RETALIERS TO GET FOR MYSELF A HTC ONE-V AFTER READING ALL POSSIBLE REVIEWS FROM ALL POSSIBLE SITES ON THE WEB. THE PROCEEDINGS WENT ON WELL AND I OWNED A PIECE FOR MYSELF AT THE END OF THE DAY. I FORGOT TO CHECK FOR THE EAR-PIECE VOLUME(IN-CALL VOLUME) THE SAME DAY OF PURCHASE AS THE PHONE WAS RUNNING OUT OF CHARGE. THE NEXT DAY WHEN I GOT A CALL FROM MY FRIEND I FOUND THAT THE SPEAKERS WERE PROBLEMATIC. I WASNT ABLE TO HEAR WHAT THE OTHER PERSON SPEAKS ON THE OTHER SIDE. IT WAS SO FEEBLE AND WAS SO DISTORTING. INITIALLY, I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE DUE TO FLECTUATING NETWORK ISSUE, BUT LATER FOUND TO HAVE PROBLEM WITH THE SPEAKERS.
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS MODEL AT CHENNAI AND BY THE TIME I SENSED AN ISSUE WITH THE HAND SET I WAS IN BANGALORE. I TOOK THIS TO THE AUTHORIZED HTC SERIVE CENTRE AT CHENNAI TRAVELLING DOWN TO CHENNAI AVAILING A DAY'S LEAVE AND GOT A DAO CERTIFICATE FOR THE SAME WHICH SAYS THAT THE MODEL WOULD BE REPLACED ASAP. I GOT THE CERTIFICATE AS WELL. I WAS THE SIXTH CUSTOMER AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT ALL THE OTHER FIVE CUSTOMERS TURNED UP TO THE SERVICE CENTER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. I WAS AMAZED.
      
      
      HTC HAS COME UP WITH AN AWKWARD PROCESS OF GETTING IT REPLACED WITH THE SAME STORE WHERE I PURCHASED THE HANDSET. WHAT IF I GOT IT IN DELHI AND SENSE A PROBLEM COMING ALL THE WAY TO BANGALORE? AND THEY DO NOT HAVE A TIME LIMIT (NUMBER OF DAYS) WITHIN WHICH THE DAO NEEDS TO BE SERVICED.
      
      
      SO IT HAS BEEN TEN DAYS NOW AND I HAVENT GOT THE REPLACEMENT PIECE FOR MYSELF. I DUNNO IF THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE RETAILER OR HTC, BUT THIS IS ANNOYING. THIS IS REALLY ANNOYING. HTC COULDNT HELP ME OUT IN THIS AS WELL.
      
      
      THIS IS GONNA BE MA FIRST AND LAST HTC HANDSET.
      
      
      HTC HAS POOR SERVICE AND A LOT OF MANUFACTURING DEFECTS. SO GUYS DO NOT GO BY APPERANCE, BETTER OPT FOR A DIFFERENT MAKE.

      ALL IN ALL A VERY GOOD PHONE. I AM SATISFIED EVEN AFTER PAYING A BOMB FOR IT. BUT I KNOW I AM USING A TOP 3 PHONE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW (FROM IPHONE 4S, SAMSUNG SIII AND HTC ONE X). THAT IS AN AMAZING FEELING TO HAVE THE BEST IN THE WORLD IN YOUR HAND !!!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"BOUGHT IT FOR 21K FROM GREY MARKET ,. THE DEAL WAS A STEAL. AND THE PHONE IS A MASSIVE BEAST !! IF ANDROID , THEN HTC FOR SURE , MAKES SAMSUNG LOOK SUPER LAME ! THE FEEL OF THE PHONE IS WAY BETTER THAN SAMSUNG S2,3 WATEVA .. DEFINITELY THE BEST ANDROID PHONE IN THE MARKET !! IF U ARE CHOOSING BETWEEN S3 AND ONE X , GO FOR THIS WITH UR EYES CLOSED !!!!!!!!!!!!1"
HTC One X E720,5,DOES EVERYTHING FAST GREAT PHONE!!! HTC ONE X RULES OVER OTHERS VERY HAPPY TO SAY. BETER THAN APPLE OR SAMSUNG IN MY OPTION NOW GO OUT AND BUY TWO OF THEM!!! MY WIFE LOVES THE SCREEN SIZE PLUS BEATS BASS IS GREAT FOR MUSIC OR MOVIES!!!
HTC One X E720,5,"FINALLY HTC HAS SHOWN THAT IT CAN PRODUCE A PHONE THAT PEOPLE WILL RECOMMEND. GOT IT FROM A LOCAL STORE, BECAUSE I JUST COULD NOT WAIT TO GET IT FROM FLIPKART AFTER SEEING THE DEVICE. THIS DEVICE LOOKS AMAZING AND FEELS GREAT IN HAND. PREVIOUSLY I HAD MOTOROLA RAZR BUT THIS ONE IS ALMOST THE SAME SIZE YET IT HAS A 4.7"" SLCD 2 DISPLAY WITH WHOOPING 720P RESOLUTION. THIS SCREEN IS A BEAUTY TO LOOK AT.BRIGHTNESS AND COLOR SATURATION IS AMAZING. THE MAIN FEATURE IS THE F2.0 APERTURE CAMERA. I MUST TELL IT TAKES AWESOME PICS AND THE CAPTURING SPEED IS JUST AWESOME. YOU CAN TAKE PHOTOS WHILE RECORDING A VIDEO ALSO.
      
      
      FINALLY THE SENSE 4 IS BUTTERY SMOOTH THANKS TO NVIDIA TEGRA 3. THIS TIME SENSE HAS DONE SOME PHYSICAL WORK AND REDUCED IT'S WEIGHT AND IT DOES IMPROVE EVERY ASPECT OF THE ANDROID OS WHILE KEEPING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ICS (ANDROID 4.0). FURTHER IT COMES WITH 25 GB OF DROPBOX STORAGE FOR 2 YEARS, SO ONLINE SHARING AND STORING JUST BECAME A LOT EASY. THIS IS TRULY THE BEAST AMONG ALL AND THIS IS THE BEST YOU CAN BUY NOW. GO FOR IT GUYS."
HTC One X E720,5,"FIRST OF ALL KUDOS TO FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING MY HOX SUPER-FAST. THIS IS A BEAST OF A PHONE. THE PHONE BROKE EVERY KNOWN BOUNDARY OF SMARTPHONES AND EMERGED AS A SUPERPHONE.
      
      
      EVERYTHING FROM ITS SUPER LCD 2 IPS DISPLAY TO EXCELLENT SENSE IMPLEMENTATION IS AWESOME.
      
      
      THE ONLY DOWNER IS THE MICRO-SIM AND THE BATTERY LIFE, EVERYTHING ELSE IS ABSOLUTELY STELLAR. THE BATTERY LIFE IS KIND OF EXPECTED, WITH ITS POWERFUL PROCESSOR AND THE RICH DISPLAY AND SLIM DESIGN IT COULDN'T BE HELPED.
      
      
      I AM ENJOYING MY NEW PHONE, THANKS TO FLIPKART."
HTC One X E720,5,"FIRSTLY, WISH I COULD GIVE THIS A 10/5 RATING!!!..DAMN THIS MONSTER PHONE IS AWEJAWDROPPING BEAUTIFUL..NOTHING LIKE ITS LCD 2 DISPLAY, THE ICONS SEEM AS IF THEY ARE FLOATING OR GLUED ON THE SCREEN.THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE AND OH MY, WHAT A LEAP(THOUGH IT WILL TAKE TIME BEFORE I GET USED TO THE INTERFACE).
      
      
      BODY:PROBABLY THE BEST SHELL DESIGN I HAVE EVER SEEN ON A PHONE, ITS A POLYCARBONATE SINGLE PIECE DIE SHELL WHICH HOUSES THE BEST CAMERA I EXPERIENCED AFTER MY SLR.
      
      
      CAMERA:SECOND TO SLR, I MEAN REALLY ITS THAT GOOD..THE IMAGES ARE VIVID AND SHARP, THE SHOOT AND RECORD FEATURE IS VERY USEFUL AND ALSO VERY RESPONSIVE.
      
      
      DISPLAY:AHH, SHEER BEAUTY PERIOD, NO OTHER PHONE CAN BEAT THIS DISPLAY..NOT EVEN THE UPCOMING S3.THE DISPLAY JUST IS THAT GOOD.
      
      
      PROCESSOR:   ""SNAPPY""
      
      
      OS: VERY SMOOTH AND FLUIDIC, THOUGH I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST WHETHER TO BUY THIS COZ I HAD SEEN SOME -VE REVIEWS ON THE YOUTUBE BUT THOSE ARE DUFF PEOPLE WITH DUFF PHONES IT SEEMS:P
      
      
      BATTERY: GIVES ME ENUF JUICE TO LAST A FULL DAY WITH A FAIRLY HEAVY USAGE..DONT LISTEN TO ALL OTHER CRAP REVIEWS FROM ABOVE..HALF OF THEM DON'T HAVE THIS PHONE :P
      
      
      ALL IN ALL A GREAT PHONE, CUDN'T WRITE A LONG REVIEW 'COS I AM STILL IN THE ""LEARNING"" MODE :P:P
      
      
      THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOOLAH, CAN HANDLE THIS BABY AND WANNA FLAUNT IT, JUST GO FOR IT..I AINT A BIG SAMSUNG FANBOY SO I WILL SUGGEST Y'ALL TO GO FOR THIS AS S3 WASN'T THAT IMPRESSIVE AT THE LAUNCH."
HTC One X E720,5,"GOT IT 15 DAYS BACK..BELIEVE ME ITS BEAUTY...THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS AWESOME, I HAVE NEVER HAD TO WAIT FOR ANYTHING TO OPEN; THANKS TO 1.5 GHZ QUAD CORE. GRAPHICS ARE GREAT, DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE NON-SUPPORT OF SD CARD AS THE 32 GB IS AWESOME SPACE IF YOU USE IT PROPERLY &AMP; IF U R GETTING ALL THIS WE CAN LOOK FOR OTHER OPTIONS FOR STORAGE LIKE CLOUD SPACE OR SYNC WHICH CAN STORE YOUR DATA ON PC.
      
      LOOKS ARE KILLER. I HAVE A GNOTE, A SIII &AMP; SII...HOWEVER I HAVE NOT USED AN IPHONE BUT LOOKING AT HE REVIEWS OF IPHONE &AMP; MY PERSONAL EXP WITH ABOVE MENTIONED SAMSUNG PHONES I CAN SAY THAT THEY CANT EVEN HAVE THE COURAGE TO LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THIS BEAUTY.
      
      I HAVE READ ABOUT THE NEGATIVES OF BATTERY BUT AFTER USING IT FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS I WOULD SAY THAT AFTER 4-5 COMPLETE CHARGES IT GIVES GREAT BACKUP. WITH WIFI, 3G &AMP; VIDEOS WATCH, OCCASIONAL TEXTS &AMP; FREQUENT CALLS IT IS NOW GIVING ME 24-30 HRS WHICH IS MORE THAN EXPECTED. SOMEONE RIGHTLY SAID A BIGGER BATTERY DOESNT MEANS BIG BACKUP TIME....JUST GO FOR IT"
HTC One X E720,5,"GREAT DEVICE FOR ANDROID
      
      BUILD QUALITY - MARVELOUS
      
      CAMERA - AMAZING
      
      VIDEO CAMERA - THAT TOO AMAZING
      
      PACKAGING - SUPERB
      
      FREE GIFT - JBL BUZZ IT'S SO COOL
      
      DELIVERY OF FLIPKART - LIGHTNING FAST
      
      ALL N ALL IT'S GREAT!!!! :)GUYS GO FOR IT."
HTC One X E720,5,"GUYS WAIT FOR THE GALAXY S3!!!!
      
      THE S3 HAS A BIGGER SCREEN, WAY BETTER BATTERY LIFE, BETTER VIDEO SHOOTING CAPABILITIES, AND A UI TO DROOL UPON.
      
      
      PRICE.....HMMM IT MAY BE A LITTLE HIGHER (MAX 1K MORE),BUT IT BRINGS TO THE TABLE SO MANY MORE FEATURES!!!!!
      
      
      I'M NOT CRITICIZING THE ONE X, IT HAS A BETTER BODY(POLY-CARBONATE), A GREAT UI, AND A GREAT CAMERA TOO!
      
      
      BUT IT HAS BAD BATTERY LIFE, WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE LOOK IN A PHONE.
      
      
      SAMSUNG IS A LITTLE LATE, BUT IT HAS BROUGHT AWESOMENESS TO THE MARKET, IN THE FORM OF THE S3 I9300.
      
      
      IT'S A WIN-WIN FOR ANDROID, THOUGH! :P"
HTC One X E720,5,GUYS....IF U WANNA GO FOR THIS JUST DO IT COZ IT IS REALLY A MONSTER!!!!!  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR THE PAST 3 MONTHS NOW AND ITS JUST WAAAYY TOOO AWESOME......DO NO GO ON REVIEWS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE QUOTING HERE FROM OTHER WEBSITES THAT THE PHONE HAS SOME ISSUES. TAKE IT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE....THERE IS ONLY ONE BIT THAT IS TRUE....THE PHONE GETS HOT WHEN PLAYING GRAPHIC INTENSIVE GAMES AND BATTERY LIFE IS NOT THAT GOOD....OTHERWISE JUST BUY IT WITH UR EYES CLOSED....I DID THAT AND JUST ENJOYING EVERY MOMENT OF IT :D
HTC One X E720,5,"HAVE USED THE PHONE FOR OVER A MONTH NOW, HERE ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS.
      
      
      1. THIS IS A PIECE OF ART, NOT JUST A PHONE. AN ANDROID ANSWER TO THE APPLE AESTHETICS.
      
      
      2. HTC SENSE 4: IS AMAZING TO USE AND IS VERY INTUITIVE.
      
      
      3. ICE CREAM SANDWITCH IS AWESOME. GUESS WHAT, HTC HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED THAT ONE X WILL RECEIVE OTA JELLY BEAN UPDATE SOON ;)
      
      
      4. ALL THOSE WHO MENTION BATTERY IS A CONCERN SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A 4.7 INCH SCREEN SMART PHONE. IT IS BOUND TO DRAIN BATTERY(1800 MAH).
      
      THE BATTERY CAN HIT 100 TO 0 IF THE SCREEN IS ON FOR 7.5 HRS STRAIGHT.
      
      BUT, THIS IS BOUND TO HAPPEN WITH ALL PHONES, EXCEPT THE MOTO RAZOR MAXX WITH ITS HUGE 3300 MAH BATTERY.
      
      I USE JUICEDEFENDER, AN APP AVAILABLE ON THE PLAY STORE, THIS MANAGES MY BATTERY AND GIVES ME A FEW EXTRA HOURS.
      
      I AM A HEAVY USER OF THE PHONE, AND THE BATTERY LAST 24 HOURS, SERVES MY NEED.
      
      
      5. CAMERA IS GOOD, AUTO FOCUS IS SLOW, BUT CAN LIVE WITH IT.
      
      
      6. BEATS FOR HTC IS A GOOD MUSIC QUALITY ENHANCER. YOUR MUSIC EXPERIENCE WILL BE GREAT.
      
      
      7. THE PHONE IS BLAZING FAST WITH ITS BEASTLY 1.5GHZ QUAD-CORE PROCESSOR + 1GB RAM.
      
      
      8. FIXED 32GB MEMORY. THIS MAY BE A DRAWBACK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING TO STORE MORE THAN 32GB OF DATA ON PHONE.
      
      
      9. DUE TO THE POLYCARBONATE CASING THE BATTERY CANNOT BE DETACHED. THIS COULD BE A CONCERN AT A LATER POINT OF TIME, BUT I DECIDED TO TAKE THE RISK.
      
      
      THE ONLY COMPETITOR FOR THE ONEX IN THE MARKET IS THE SAMSUNG S3.
      
      1.WOULD CHOSE THE ONEX POLYCARBONATE FINISH OVER THE SAMSUNG PLASTIC.
      
      2.HTC SENSE IS A BEAUTY IN COMPARISON TO THE SAMSUNG TOUCHWIZ
      
      3. SAMSUNG WITH ITS 2200MAH BATTERY MAY GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXTRA JUICE OVER THE 1800MAH ONEX BATTERY, BUT THAT THE TRADEOFF I WAS WILLING TO DO FOR A SHEER PIECE OF ART !!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"HELLO ALL,
      
      
      HTC NEEDED A MUCH REQUIRED BREAK FROM THEIR MIND NUMBING CHURNING OUT OF PHONES WHICH NONE PARTICULARLY LIKED NOR DID THEY BECOME ANY REMEMBRANCE OF INNOVATION WHICH THIS LITTLE TIWANESE COMPANY IS PROUD OF. ENTER ONE X, HERE IS HOW THE GAME CHANGER IS IN. WHY, IS IT QUAD CORE, 4.7 INCH 720P DISPLAY, 32 GB DRIVE, A RUGGED BODY OR ICS... OR JUST A ME TOO DEVICE CRYING OUT FOR ATTENTION WITH A FALSE SENSE OF BEING THE TOP OF THE LINE DEVICE?
      
      
      COMING TO VALUE OF OWNING IT? WHY SHOULD YOU BUY IT? WOULD YOU FEEL JEALOUS WHEN YOU SAW IT IN SOMEONE ELSE'S PALM? EVEN WHEN YOU OWNED AN ARC S/ ALL MIGHTY S2 OR THE CHAMP LIKE IPHONE 4S? THANKFULLY YES. IT HAS A DISPLAY TO DIE FOR. IN NORMAL SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY THE PIXELATION DOES PERTURB A PERSON WHO IS USED TO THE BRILLIANCE OF RETINA DISPLAY OR AN SUPER AMOLED PLUS. HERE THIS KIDDO COMES AND SWAGGERS WITH ITS 1280X720 DISPLAY. WELL IT IS NOT ONLY IN THE NUMBERS, IT IS NONE SLCD 2 WHICH IS FURTHER REFINEMENT IN DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY. AND THE DISPLAY BEING VERY CLOSE TO YOUR INPUTS IT FEELS LIKE STUFF FLOATING AT EVERY POKE.
      
      
      ABOUT PERFORMANCE, NO NEED TO REPEAT THE BENCHMARKS WHICH THIS BEAST OF A DEVICE STANDS AT THE HILT. THE COMPANY ALSO BIDS HIGH INNOVATION IT'S CAPACITY TO REPLACE YOUR ALL SO FAITHFUL POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA. REST ASSURED YOU WOULD NOT NEED THAT. THIS TAKES AS GOOD PICTURES AS THE IPHONE 4S AND LEADS IN LOW LIGHT TAKES DUE TO F2.0 APERTURE.
      
      
      SO WILL IT CRACK THE IPHONE 4S, KNOCK OUT THE S2? WELL, IT IS NOT ATTEMPTING TOO AND IF DOES IT WILL, IT IS ACTUALLY A VERY EARLY ENTRY TO THE TRIO OF GAME BETWEEN GALAXY S3, IPHONE 5 AND ITSELF. FOR THE TIME BEING IF YOU REALLY WANNA GRAB THIS YOU SHOULD, IT IS SURE TO INFLATE YOUR EGO BY A FULL CIRCLE.

HTC One X E720,5,"HELLO GUYS,
      
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART AND I WILL LIKE TO SAY THAT, IT IS THE BEAST PHONE WITH AWESOME PERFORMANCE AND WONDERFUL ANIMATIONS. NVIDIA TEGRA 3 HAS TOTALLY CHANGE THE CONCEPT OF ANDROID PHONES. IT IS A MINI PC.
      
      
      IF YOU GUYS ARE THINKING TO GO FOR NOTE, KINDLY GO FOR THIS ONE BECAUSE NOTE SUCKS AND THIS PHONE ROCKS. PAY A LITTLE MORE AND THE PERFORMANCE THAT YOU WILL GET IS BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION.
      
      
      THIS PHONE BEATS EVERY PHONE IN MARKET AND I THINK THIS WILL BE THE GADGET OF THE YEAR 2012..!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"HELLO USERS/BUYERS/HTC LOVERS,
      
      
      EVERYBODY IS CONCERNED WITH THE BATTERY LIFE OF HTC ONE X. ALL THE REVIEW SITES HAVE REVIEWED THE HTC ONE X WITH THE FIRMWARE 1.26, THAT IS - PRE-RELEASE. AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE MOBILE, HTC ARE ISSUING ON-THE-AIR UPDATE (OTA) TO NEW FIRMWARE - 1.27.
      
      
      WITH THE NEW UPDATED FIRMWARE, THE BATTERY LIFE IS EXTENDED NEARLY TWICE. I HAD 8.5 HOURS(NEARLY) BEFORE THE UPDATE AND I HAVE NOW 16.5HOURS WITH ABOVE AVERAGE USAGE. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT BATTERY, AS HTC HAVE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE AND IT IS BEST IN ITS CLASS NOW!!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"HI ALL,
      
      
      I HAVE NOT BOUGHT THE HTC ONE X FROM THE FLIPKART SITE, BUT HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE NOW FOR THE PAST 2 MONTHS. IT'S AN AWESOME PHONE AND SPECIFICATION-WISE HAS THE BEST STUFF IN IT'S CATEGORY. WHILE YOU CAN READ UP ALL ABOUT THE SPECIFICATIONS ON THSI SITE, HERE IS SOMETHING I WANT TO ADD FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      1. BLAZING FAST UI AND PROCESSOR - FROM THE LOCK SCREEN IT GETS INTO YOUR HOME SCREEN AND ANY APP IN LESS THAN A SECOND. ONE CAN DIRECTLY ENTER AN APP BY DRAGGING IT INTO THE LOCK RING AND I FIND THIS SO CONVENIENT WHEN I WANT TO CHECK MY GMAIL OR TAKE A PHOTO. PLUS YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE WHICH APPS TO SHOW NEXT TO THE LOCK RING. BY CONTRAST THE SAMSUNG S3 TAKES MORE TIME TO GET TO THE HOME SCREEN ON UNLOCKING. I GUESS THAT'S DUE TO ITS QUAD CORE 1.5 GHZ PROCESSOR. SAMSUNG USES A 1.4 GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR OF A DIFFERENT MAKE.
      
      
      2. ABSOLUTELY STUNNER OF A HD CAMERA THAT RECORDS AT FULL 1080 P AS OPPOSED TO THE SAMSUNG S3, WHICH RECORDS AT 720P ONLY. THE 8 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA TAKES REALLY GOOD STILL IMAGES, ALTHOUGH STABILIZATION IS NECESSARY TO REALLY GREAT PICTURES. THE BEST THING I LIKED ABOUT THE CAMERA IS THAT YOU CAN SPECIFY WHICH PART OF THE IMAGE YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON, BY JUST TAPPING THAT PART OF THE IMAGE ON THE SCREEN. TH EFFECT IS THAT YOI CAN ACTUALLY TAKE POTRAITS WITH ALL THE BACKGROUND BLURRED OUT, JUST LIKE IN A DSLR.
      
      
      3. THE HTC SENSE 4.0 UI IS BUTTERY SMOOTH, INTIUTIVE AND MAKES IT A PLEASURE TO MULTITASK. THE ANDROID ICS IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT OF THE PREVIOUS ANDROID VERSIONS AND BRINGS IT VERY CLOSE TO THE IOS EXPERIENCE, ALTHOUGH THE IOS IS DEFINITELY SUPERIOR IN TERMS OF EXPERIENCE VS PROCESSOR BANDWIDTH USE.
      
      
      4. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I SEE IS THE 1250 MAH BATTERY THAT LASTS FOR JUST 10 HOURS WITH MODERATE TO HEAVY USAGE. THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 HAS A BIGGER BATTERY THAT LAST MUCH LONGER. SO IT'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU LIKE TRAVELING WITH THE CHARGER USB CORD ALL THE TIME OR NOT.
      
      
      5. THE LACK OF A MICRO SD SLOT ON THE PHONE IS NOT REALLY A DAMPER IN THE SENSE THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW OCCASIONS FOR USERS TO EXCEED 32 GB IN STORING APPS OR FILES, UNLESS THEY ARE INTO HEAVY GAMING AND MOVIES ON THE MOBILE.
      
      
      GIVEN THE CURRENT PRICING OF THE SAMSUNG S3, I PERSONALLY FELT THAT THE HTC ONE X IS BETTER, GIVING YOU THE SAME FEATURES, BETTER UI AND CAMERA THAN THE S3 FOR A LESSER PRICE.
      
      
      BEST WISHES,
      
      DEV"
HTC One X E720,5,"HTC ONE X SHOULD BE A CLEAR WINNER
      
      HTC WITH FAST BOOT FEATURE ;

HTC One X E720,5,HTC ONE X.. WHITE... ITZ A GEM... NO DOUBT ITZ THE BEST PHONE... NO... ITZ THE BEAST.. BUT.. GUYS... CHECK OUT FOR HTC ONE X SCREEN BANDING ISSUE.. YOUTUBE HAS VIDEOS ABOUT IT.

      QUALITY OF THE PHONE IS OUTSTANDING.. NO PLASTIC BODY BUT STILL ITS AMAZINGLY LIGHT THANKS TO THE NEW POLY-CARBONATE BODY. IT DOES LOOK AND FEEL RICH AND WORTH THE PRICE. THE BEST PHONE IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW AND I DOUBT ANYONE WILL BE ABLE TO BEAT IT FOR A LONG TIME. WHITE COLOR BODY SCORES MORE OVER BROWN.. I TOO HAD CONCERNS OF DIRT AND STAINS BUT ITS NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL!"
HTC One X E720,5,"I AM NOT EXAGGERATING WHEN I SAY I WILL DITCH MY GIRLFRIEND FOR THIS BEAUTY. HTC ONE X IS THE REASON WHY I SLEEP LATE AND WAKE UP EARLY JUST TO BE WITH HER...WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE TECHNICAL DETAILS LET ME SAY THAT THE CAMERA,HTC SENSE COUPLED WITH ICS, BEATS AUDIO(OMG!!!!)

      2. THE PHONE GETS HEATED UP WHILE PLAYING GAMES..
      
      3. THE BATTERY IS NOT REPLACEABLE."

      2. HAS A BRIGHTER SCREEN(SUPER IPS LCD 2 DISPLAY,312 PPI PIXEL DENSITY),WHICH IS BETTER THAN S3.
      
      3. HAS 32 GB STORAGE,BUT U CAN USE AROUND 25GB FOR DATA..SINCE IT DOESNT HAV AN SD CARD EXPANSION..ITS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE SINCE THINGS LOAD UP MUCH FASTER WITH THE ONBOARD MEMORY.
      
      4. TEGRA 3 QUAD CORE PROCESSOR WITH A 12 CORE GPU...THE BEST FOR GAMING N HD MOVIES.

      6. MORE REASONABLY PRICED THAN S3 AND IPHONE 4S..

      11. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY MAJOR LAGS OR FORCED SHUT DOWNS ON MY HTC ONE X..RUNS BUTTERY SMOOTH..
      
      
      NOW HERE COMES THE CONS:
      
      
      1. THE SENSE 4 UI ON IT IS BEAUTIFUL BUT CAN GET CHOPPY   SOMETIMES.
      
      2. BATTERY LASTS BARELY ABOUT A DAY...SHUD HAVE HAD MORE JUICE..
      
      3. CAMERA LENS IS QUITE EXPOSED(POPPING OUT) N PRONE TO SCRATCHES SO BUY A GOOD CASE/COVER FOR THE PHONE.
      
      4. DEFAULT BROWSER IS A LITTLE SLOW.
      
      5. TAKES TIME TO GET FULLY CHARGED.
      
      6. DEVICE GETS HOT WHILE PLAYING GAMES OR WHILE HEAVY MULTITASKING.
      
      7. CANNOT REPLACE/REMOVE BATTERY SINCE THE BODY IS SEALED."

      BUT THE ONE X GIVES ME ABOUT 20 HRS OF BATTERY BEFORE ASKING TO PLUG IN.
      
      THE INTERFACE IS SMOOTH AS EVER &AMP; APPS LOAD FAST. I WOULD SAY THAT HTC HAS WORKED A LOT ON THIS AND DELIVERED A MASTERPIECE.
      
      THE SAMSUNG S3 IS ALSO A MASTERPIECE BUT PEOPLE FEEL CHEATED DUE IT PLASTICKY FEEL. BUT IT'S NOT THE CASE. THE PLASTIC USED IS GOOD IF NOT GREAT. EVEN THE ONE X IS MADE UP OF PLASTIC BACK COVER BUT ONLY IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT.
      
      ANYWAY THERE IS NO REAL WINNER IN THE S3 VS. ONE X BATTLE. THE S3 WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GOOD IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE ONE X.
      
      
      ITS A PERSONAL CHOICE AND FOR ME THE ONE X IS THE BEST PHONE IN THE MARKET SO FAR!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THE ONEX NOW FOR OVER A MONTH. OVERALL ITS A GOOD GADGET TO HAVE IN YOUR POCKET.ICS LOOKS A BIT STRANGE FOR OLDER ANDROID VERSION USERS BUT ONCE U GET HOLD OF IT, ITS SOMETHING U WILL MISS ON NON ICS PHONES
      
      
      POSITIVES:
      
      -&GT;ITS FAST..VERY FAST..ALSO BOOTS UP REALLY FAST
      
      -&GT;AUDIO IS REALLY COOL EVEN WITH THE STANDARD HEADPHONES
      
      -&GT;ALL GAMES AND APPS RUN SMOOTHLY WITHOUT ANY HICCUPS
      
      -&GT;LOTS OF FEATURES IN THE CAMERA- PREVIOUSLY I USED A I5801 SO IT SEEMS TOO MUCH FOR ME
      
      -&GT;ICS AND SENSE 4 PROVIDE AN AWESOME UI
      
      -&GT;I LOVE THE VIDEO RECORDING AND STILL CAMERA AT THE SAME TIME FEATURE
      
      
      NEGATIVES:
      
      -&GT;INHERENT PROBLEM OF HTC PHONES WITH BATTERY BACKUP.WORKS PRETTY WELL FOR ALMOST A FULL DAY WITH GAMING,CALLING AND NET USAGE.
      
      -&GT;SOMETIMES GETS HEATED UP WHILE PLAYING GAMES.
      
      -&GT;CAMERA - DOESN'T SHOOT WELL IN AUTO MODE,HDR MODE IS AWESOME BUT WITH LITTLE SHAKE THE PICS GET BLURRED.
      
      -&GT;4.7 KINDA BIG SCREEN TO BE USED IN ONE HAND
      
      -&GT;AROUND 26 GB USER AVAILABLE MEMORY.NOT EXACTLY A DEMERIT ,BUT DEFINITELY COULD HAVE BEEN MORE."
HTC One X E720,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW, AND MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. TYPICAL USAGE SCENARIO IS: BLUETOOTH + WIFI ENABLED, 2G DATA CONNECTION. THIS IS PERHAPS HOW MOST PEOPLE WOULD USE THE PHONE, AND IN THIS CASE, THE PHONE NEEDS TO BE CHARGED TWICE A DAY. WITH 100% BATTERY, THE PHONE DRAINS OUT COMPLETELY ABOUT LATE EVENING, AND NEEDS TO BE RECHARGED. IT'S ADVISABLE TO HAVE A CAR CHARGER HANDY, OR KEEP A SEPARATE CHARGER FOR WORK AND HOME.
      
      
      I GUESS ALL THOSE AMAZING FEATURES, POWERFUL PROCESSOR AND INHERENT MULTITASKING ALL TAKE ITS TOLL ON BATTERY LIFE. BUT THE SATISFACTION OF USING THIS PHONE EVERYDAY, HELPS OVERLOOK THE BATTERY ISSUE. I READ SOMEWHERE THAT A 3,000 MAH (INSTEAD OF 1,800 MAH) BATTERY WOULD HAVE REALLY BOOSTED BATTERY LIFE. BUT FITTING IT INSIDE SUCH A SLEEK BODY WOULD BE A SEPARATE ENGINEERING CHALLENGE.
      
      
      OVERALL, A GREAT PHONE. IF YOU DRIVE, KEEP A CAR CHARGER HANDY, AND YOUR PHONE WILL NEVER RUN SHORT OF JUICE."
HTC One X E720,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW. AND I THINK THIS ONE IS GEM OF ALL SMART PHONES.
      
      PROS:
      
      -QUALITY HARDWARE
      
      -RICH FEEL
      
      -AWESOME PROCESSING SPEED
      
      -UNMATCHED PERFORMANCE OF HTC SENSE
      
      -WELL FOCUSED PICTURES
      
      -EASE OF ACCESSIBILITY AMONGST VARIOUS APPLICATION
      
      -HIGH QUALITY AUDIO
      
      -BRILLIANT SUPER LCD DISPLAY (ITS BETTER THEN AMOLED, JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER AND YOU WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      -HEATS UP LITTLE, BUT THAT'S ACCEPTABLE WITH SUCH PROCESSOR
      
      -BATTERY LIFE, NEEDS 2-3 CHARGES A DAY, THAT'S TOO ACCEPTABLE WITH CONTINUOUS 3G USE AND GAMING, AND CAN BE MANAGED WITH APPLICATION LIKE JUICE DEFENDER
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING SAMSUNG BEFORE, THIS IS MY FIRST HTC PHONE, AND TRUST ME IT'S PLEASURE USING THIS PHONE, IT'S SIMPLY UNMATCHED ! ! !"
HTC One X E720,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST 5 DAYS OR SO. I HAVE FOUND IT TO BE THE BEST ANDROID IN THE MARKET AND IT IS FOR SURE IS A IPHONE KILLER. AND MY MAIN FOCUS WAS ON THE BATTERY WHICH IS TURNING OUT TO BE A GOOD ONE. WITH GENERAL USAGE, I WAS ABLE TO USE THE PHONE FOR A GOOD 2 DAY WITH A SINGLE FULL CHARGE."
HTC One X E720,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT SO MANY ITEMS FROM FLIPKART BEFORE AND THEY HAVE NEVER DISAPPOINTED WITH THEIR SERVICE. ABOUT THE PHONE, I LOVED IT. I USED TO HAVE HTC DESIRE S BEFORE AND NEEDED UPGRADE. I LOOKED FOR MANY OPTIONS LIKE IPHONE AND SAMSUNG S3. BUT NONE OF THEM STAND AGAINST HTC FEATURES, LIKE SMART DIAL, TEXT ALIGNMENT IN BROWSER, HTC SENSE AND OTHERS. CAMERA IS GREAT, BUT NEEDS SOME WORK ON IT. SOUND IS DESCENT, CAN BE IMPROVED. HANDLING IS GREAT, FEELS SMOOTH IN HAND."
HTC One X E720,5,"I HAVE HAD USED GNOTE FOR A BRIEF PERIOD AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED ABOUT THE CAPABILITY IT HAS. NO DOUBT SAMSUNG HAS DEVELOPED A BEASTY SPEED CRAZY PHONE A.K.A PHABLET. BUT THIS HTC ONE X IS SUPERSONIC. THOUGH IT HAS A COMPARITIVELY SMALLER SCREEN (GNOTE:5.3 INCHES, ONE X 4.7 INCHES) BUT C'MON IT IS A PHONE. WHEN I WAS USING GNOTE IT WAS AT SOMETIMES AWKWARD TO HOLD IT TO MY EARS.
      
      
      WHEN YOU START USING ONE X ONE THING WILL ALWAYS PONDER IN YOUR MIND I.E, WHAT ALL IT HAS MORE IN IT. IT WILL TAKE ATLEAST FEW WEEKS AND HOURS OF SURFING ON YOUR PHONE TO DECIPHER ITS CAPABILITIES.
      
      
      HTC AND ITS BATTERY LIFE:
      
      THE MOMENT YOU ASK SOMEONE ABOUT HTC, EVERYONE TELLS YOU THAT HTC SUCKS IN BATTERY PERFORMANCE. IF YOU SPEAK ABOUT HTC ONE X, ""THE 1800MAH LI-PO BATTERY DOES NOT SUCK"". WHEN I SAY DOES NOT SUCK I MEAN THAT AS AN AVERAGE USER (ONE HOUR OF GAMES, CHECKING MAILS, INTERNET SURFING OF ABOUT AN HOUR, ABOUT 50 SNAPS OF CAMERA USAGE, ABOUT 10 MIN VIDEO RECORDING, ABOUT 1 HOUR OF TALK TIME), THIS PHONE WILL STAY BY YOUR SIDE WITHOUT DYING. I COULD NOT SAY THAT IT HAS A MAMMOTH BATTERY LIFE.
      
      IT IS EASIER TO CARRY THE USB CABLE WHICH YOU CAN PLUG IN YOUR DESKTOP OR LAPTOP ANY TIME YOU NEED. IF YOU FIND A POWER SOCKET AROUND YOU, THEN YOU CAN USE THAT AS WELL. NEVERTHELESS, HTC COULD HAVE USED A 2500MAH BATTERY FOR THE BUNDLE IT IS OFFERING.
      
      
      MOVING ON TO THE HTC SENSE 4.0 INTERFACE:
      
      ONE WORD: ECSTATIC. JUST EXPERIENCE IT.
      
      
      ANDROID 4.0.3 ICE CREAM SANDWICH:
      
      IT ROCKS AND BETTER THAN GINGERBREAD, YOUR MULTITASKING IS A PIECE OF CAKE.
      
      
      NVIDIA TEGRA QUAD CORE PROCESSOR:
      
      THIS ENGINE INSIDE YOUR HTC ONE X MAKES THE PHONE ""SUPERSONIC"".
      
      YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR TOUCH INPUTS INTIALLY TO GET USED TO THE CAPACITIVE INTERFACE. BLAZINGLY FAST AND A SURE WINNER OVER GNOTE AND SII.
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      UNLESS YOU ARE BITTEN BY A PHOTOGRAPHY BUG, YOU WILL NOT USE YOUR DIGICAM AFTER BUYING HTC ONE X. I COULD TAKE 99 SNAPS IN ONE MINUTE WITH A SINGLE CONTINUOUS CLICK. IT HAS GOT A DEDICATED IMAGE PROCESSOR MAKING PHOTOGRAPHY FUN LIKE NEVER BEFORE. AGAIN A CLEAN WINNER OVER SII AND GNOTE.
      
      
      MUSIC:
      
      I AM A MUSIC FREAK. BEATS AUDIO IS BETTER THAN ITUNES. COMPARE IT YOURSELF AND THEN ARRIVE TO THIS VERDICT. SAD THAT HTC DOES NOT PROVIDE BEATS (I/UR) HEADPHONES. NEVERTHELESS THE HEADPHONES FROM HTC IN THE BOX IS NOT BAD EITHER. AGAIN A WINNER OVER SII AND GNOTE.
      
      
      DISPLAY:
      
      SUPER LCD2 WITH HD DISPLAY IS ONE OF THE USP OF THIS. DAYLIGHT VISIBILITY IS AMAZING. THE VIEWING ANGLES ONCE COMPARED TO OTHER AMOLED DISPLAY IS BETTER IN SUPER LCD2.
      
      
      BUILT AND FEEL:
      
      IT IS SO THIN THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHILE HANDLING IT.
      
      THE POLYCARBONATE UNIBODY SHELL IS ROBUST AND HAS BETTER SHOCK ABSORBING CAPACITY AS COMPARED TO OTHER ALUMINIUM SHELLS. THE CORNING GORILLA GLASS GIVES A SOOTHING FEEL OF TOUCH, SCRATCH GUARD IS RECOMMENDED THOUGH OVER ANY TYPE OF DISPLAY. FULL MARKS TO HTC FOR THE DESIGN AND BUILT.
      
      
      I FEEL I HAVE COVERED THE BASIC REVIEW OF THIS SUPERSONIC PHONE, HIGHLY RECOMENDED IF YOU ARE READY TO SHELL 34.5K. IF YOU CAN WAIT FOR FEW MORE MONTHS BEFORE AN UPGRADE THEN WAIT FOR SIV."
HTC One X E720,5,"I HAVE JUST RECEIVED MY PHONE. AND I WOULD SAY THIS IS FAR BETTER THAN SAMSUNG S3. I HAVE COMPARED BOTH THE PHONE.HTC ONE IS SUPERIER!  I'M LOVING IT. CAMERA AWESOME, DESIGN LOOKS GREAT! SUPERB DISPLAY!"
HTC One X E720,5,"I HAVE READ MANY REVIEWS ABOUT S3 AND HTC ONE X AND MANY WEBSITES ARE BASHING ONE X FOR NOT REMOVABLE BATTERY AND NO REMOVABLE SD CARD. THEY MISSED ONE THING ABOUT IT. SECURITY, SECURITY AND SECURITY OF YOU DATA. MY OLD MOBILE WAS STOLEN WITH NO PATTERN LOCK ON. IT HAS LOTS OF DATA, MANY PERSONAL EMAILS AND SMS. THIS IS WHERE I LIKE HTC ONE X, WITH UNIBODY DESIGN NO ONE CAN SHUT DOWN/RESET MY PHONE(IF STOLEN/LOST) IF PATTERN LOCK IS ON AND DATA CAN NOT BE ACCESSED. ESPECIALLY, IF MY PHONE IS STOLEN IT WILL BE ON AS LONG AS BATTERY GOES DOWN. THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH TIME FOR ME TO TRACK THE PHONE IF SOFTWARES LIKE LOOKOUT OR SEEKDROID ARE INSTALLED.
      
      
      LETS COME TO OTHER THINGS I LIKE.
      
      1. PHONE LOOKS VERY ELEGANT. WITH ROCK SUPREME QUICK SAND COVER IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.
      
      2. HTC SENSE, I THINK THIS IS BEST UI OUT THERE, IT MAY NOT HAVE MANY FANCY S3 FEATURES BUT FOR DAILY STUFF, THIS IS BEST.
      
      3.SCREEN IS VERY GOOD AND VERY READABLE IN OUTDOOR.
      
      
      THERE WERE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT BATTERY LIFE, I ALSO FELT THAT BATTERY IS LITTLE BAD BUT AFTER USING IT FOR 2 WEEKS THE BATTERY IS GOOD(IF NOT VERY GOOD). I HAVE INSTALLED JUICE DEFENDER ULTIMATE(JD) (RS.300/-).THAT GIVES ME ONE FULL DAY WITH DECENT BROWSING, LITTLE GAMES, 20MINS OF PLAYING VIDEOS AND 3G AND WIFI ON USING JD.
      
      
      OVERALL, I STARTED TO LIKE THIS PHONE A LOT. HOPE YOU FIND MY REVIEW USEFUL."
HTC One X E720,5,"I JUST UPGRADED FROM MY HTC INCREDIBLE S TO THE THIS PHONE AND FROM THE VERY MINUTE I PRESSED THE POWER BUTTON.HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH IT !! EVEN GOT THE JELLY BEAN 4.1.1 UPDATE WITH HTC SENSE 4+ WITHIN A DAY OF USING IT ! THE HTC ONE X WHITE IS A BEAUTY..!! IT IS SUPER SLIM AND VERY LIGHT TO HOLD. THE CORNING GORILLA GLASS WITH SUPER LCD 2 OFFERS CRYSTAL CLEAR DISPLAY. 8 MP CAMERA IS PETTY GOOD WITH MULTI SHOT CAPABILITY.BEATS AUDIO IS OUT OF THE WORLD!
      
      THE 1.5 GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR IS LIGHTENING FAST  EVEN WHEN MOST APPS ARE OPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY.BATTERY LAST FOR 16+ HRS EVEN ON USING FULLTIME 3G,CALLING,FULL TIME APP AND MAIL SYNC..HOWEVER YOU EASILY SQUEEZE IT TO 20+ HRS BY OPTIMIZED MOBILE INTERNET USAGE AND SMART SYNC.THE POWER SAVE FEATURE ON THE JELLY BEAN IS VERY EFFECTIVE.
      
      
      OVER ALL THIS PHONE IS MUCH BETTER TO LOOK AT, CLASSY AND FASTER COMPARED TO THE PLASTICY SAMSUNG GALAXY S3.EVEN THOUGH THE LATTER IS 2K CHEAPER THAN THE ONE X,THIS PHONE IS DEFINITELY A BETTER BUY.
      
      
      AS USUAL FLIPKART SERVICE IS EXCELLENT.GOT MY PHONE WITHIN A DAY OF ORDERING.I LOVE THEIR SERVICE AND BUY ALL MY GADGETS AND ACCESSORIES FROM HERE.KUDOS TEAM..!!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"I LIKED IT BECAUSE OF BEATS AUDIO, BEATS HEADSET AND ELEGANT DESIGN ALSO PHONE HAS HTC SENSE 4.0 WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU WILL LOVE IT AND ITS 1.5GHZ QUAD CORE WITH 32 GB WHEREAS S3 HAS 1.4GHZ WHICH COMES WITH 16GB AND S3 SOUND IS POOR AS COMPARED TO HTC, ALSO DISPLAY SUCKS COMPARED TO HTC. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS BATTERY IS NOT REMOVAL AND BATTERY DOESN'T STAY FOR LONG TIME I HAVE TO USE THE POWER SAVER MODE APP TO SAVE MY BATTERY AND IT WORKS FOR 2 DAYS FOR ME. GO AND FEEL THE EXPERIENCE A DEMO HTC ONE X HANDSET BEFORE PURCHASING."
HTC One X E720,5,"I ORDERED HTC ONE X FROM FLIPKART. INITIALLY THE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE WAS 5-7 BUSINESS DAYS LATER THAN THE ORDER DATE. BUT ACTUALLY, IT WAS DELIVERED ON THE 2ND DAY ITSELF. VERY HAPPY WITH THE FLIPKART PACKAGING &AMP; THE PROMPT SERVICE PROVIDED.
      
      THIS IS MY SECOND PHONE FROM HTC. THE EARLIER WAS DESIRE, WHICH I HAD BOUGHT FROM FLIPKART ITSELF WHEN IT WAS LAUNHED. ONCE THE NEW HTC ONE X WAS IN MY HAND, I WAS ALMOST READY WITH ALL MY BACKUPS. THERE WAS A SMALL VISIT TO MY MOBILE SERVICE PROVIDER TO GET MY SIM CARD CUT TO THE SIZE OF A MICRO-SIM CARD. WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS, MY NEW PHONE HAD ALL THE OLD SOFTWARES I WAS USING &AMP; THE CONTACTS &AMP; MESSAGES RESTORED. I OBVIUOSLY HAD TO DOWNLOAD ALL THE OLDER SOFTWARES AGAIN ON THE NEW PHONE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ANDROID OS VERSION. AFTER 2 DAYS OF EXTENSIVE USE, I CAN PROUDLY SAY THAT I OWN ONE OF THE BEST PHONES IN THE MARKET. WITHIN THE LAST 2 DAYS OF USING THE PHONE, THE BATTERY DID NOT SEEM TO BE AN ISSUE FOR NORMAL PHONE USE. THE CAMERA QUALITY IS AWESOME &AMP; THE SOUND IS AMAZING. THERE IS NO LAG AS SUCH WHILE USING AS MANY NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT I COULD AT ONE POINT OF TIME. THE 1.5 GHZ QUAD-CORE PROCESSOR &AMP; 1 GB RAM SHOW THEIR METTLE. THE DISPLAY IS CRISP. A SPECIAL CAR MODE IS AVAILABLE FOR USE WHILE DRIVING. THE MOBILE CONNECTS WITH THE CAR DECK OVER BLUETOOTH &AMP; THE REST IS AN EASY JOB. THERE ARE A LOT OF TECHNICAL PROS &AMP; CONS WRITTEN IN VARIOUS REVIEWS WHICH PERSIST, BUT IN THE END, THE PROS OUTWEIGH THE CONS IN A DECENT MANNER. ALL IN ALL A VERY GOOD BUY!!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"I WAS VERY CONFUSED AMONG THESE 2 PHONES AND DID A THOROUGH REASEARCH ON THE QUALITY+QUANTITY AND THE PRICE THEY ARE OFFERING ,MY MAIN CONCERNS WERE ,
      
      1. GOOD CAMERA
      
      2. GOOD PICTURE QUALITY AND SHARP DISPLAY FOR GAMES
      
      3. BIG SCREEN FOR GOOD INTERNET EXPERIENCE AND GAMES
      
      4. GOOD SOUND QUALITY FOR MUSIC
      
      5. GOOD PROCESSING SPEED
      
      AND I FOUND HTC RULING ABOVE ALL, I AM VERY WITH MY DECISION , IPHONE IS MUCH LIKE A SHOW OFF WITH LIMITATIONS , SAMSUNG SIII MODEL DIDNT APEAL TO BE UNIQUE RATHER LOOK ALIKE ALL OTHER SAMSUN MODELS.
      
      HTC QUADRA PROCESSOR , NVIDIA GRAPHICAL DISPLAY , BEAT AUDIO MAKES IT UNIQUE , ALSO AS AN EXTENSIVELY 3G USER I CAN MONITOR THE 3G USAGE ,TURN THEM OFF AND ON , THANKS TO ANDROID MARKET APPS,ALSO DOWNALODED TH EFAMOUS ANGRY BIRD GAME FOR FREE ..ENJOYING IT PLAYING ON THIS BIG WIDE SCREEN..THERE WERE SOME ISSUE WITH HTC ONE X GETTING OVERHEATED BUT THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED FOR MODELS ,I THINK,MANUFACTURED WITH AND AFTER JULY DATE.
      
      I CAN CLICK VIDEO AND TAKE PICTURES AT THE SAME TIME LIKE CLICK CLICK CLICK AND 3 PICS GETS CLICKED , QUADRA PROCESSOR QUALITY IS JUST AMAZING , DONT GIVE A SECOND THOUGT JUST GO FOR IT.."
HTC One X E720,5,"IM USING HTC ONE X SINCE ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND I ALSO HAVE AN IPHONE 4S THAT I HAVE SINCE GIVEN TO MY WIFE. MY REVIEW IS MAINLY TO GIVE YOU A FIRST HAND COMPARATIVE INSIGHT BETWEEN IOS AND ANDROID.
      
      
      AS A TELEPHONING DEVICE....THE ONE X IS SUPERIOR. BECAUSE OF HOME SCREEN CUSTOMIZATION, I HAVE MY WIFI/ DATA/ DATA/ BLUETOOTH WIDGETS ON THE HOME SCREEN. IOS DOESN?T ALLOW THIS. MANY OTHER WIDGETS AND APPS MAKE LIFE MUCH EASIER AND VARIED IN THE ANDROID IOS. THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMIZATION IS LIMITLESS. ITS A GEEKS TOY.
      
      
      IF YOU NEED TO TRANSFER DATA FROM AN OLD PHONE TO AN ANDROID, ITS EASY/ POSSIBLE. YOU CAN SHARE A CONTACT VIA BLUETOOTH WITH...SAY A NOKIA. YOU CAN SEND A FILE TO ANOTHER PHONE. YOU CAN'T DO THESE THINGS WITH AN IPHONE.
      
      
      THE CAMERAS ARE COMPARABLE...BUT I FEEL THE PICTURE QUALITY IN AN IPHONE IS MORE REALISTIC COMPARED TO ONE X.
      
      
      AS FAR AS APPS GO....THE IPHONE WINS HANDS DOWN. GOOGLE PLAY IS STILL NASCENT AND NEEDS A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA. LOT OF SHITTY APPS AND PORN AS WELL. IT NEEDS TO GET RID OF THESE. I'LL BE SCARED IF MY 7 YEAR OLD ACCIDENTALLY OPENS GOOGLE PLAY.
      
      
      IOS IS MADE ONLY FOR IPHONE AND VICE-VERSA. ITS A VERY TIGHT FIT. THINGS ALMOST NEVER GO WRONG. IN ANDROID, THEY DO.
      
      
      MOST IMPORTANT: TWO OF THE MOST ICONIC FEATURES OF IOS, SIRI AND ITUNES, ARE OF NO USE IN OUR COUNTRY. ( IM TALKING ITUNES FOR MUSIC). ANDROID HAS SOME GREAT APPS FOR MUSIC LOVERS; INTERNET RADIO/ REGULAR RADIO AND BESIDES SAAVN AND SOUNDHOUND.
      
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS BAD IN BOTH. I HAVE A CHARGER AT HOME, WORK AND CAR FOR BOTH PHONES
      
      
      TIP: IF YOU?RE A HEAVY PHONE/ APP USER, DON'T GO FOR A ENTRY LEVEL ANDROID. THEY'RE CRAP."
HTC One X E720,5,"I'M USING THIS FONE FROM PAST 2 MONTHS AND ITS EVERY FEATURE IS OUT PERFORMING, BEFOR THIS I WAS HAVING HTC SENSATION FOR WHICH I WAS CARRYING EXTRA BATTERY, BUT THIS FONE IS DELIVERING EXCEPTIONALY IN BATTERY PERFORMANCE ALSO ...EVEN AFTER HEAVY USAGE ...I WILL DEFINATELY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT WITH 5 RATING."
HTC One X E720,5,"ITS AN AWESOME PRODUCT, AND FLIPKART HAD DELIVERED THE PRODUCT IN GOOD PACKAGING. THE UI IS SMOOTH AND CAMERA IS ONE OF THE BEST IN CLASS. ALTHOUGH BATTERY LIFE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN BUT IT MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR THE GORGEOUS SCREEN."
HTC One X E720,5,"ITS ANOTHER AMAZING HANDSET FROM HTC THATS GONNA ROCK THE Q3 AND Q4 OF THIS 2012. ITS THE BEST ANDROID SMARTPHONE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. YOU WILL SURELY LOVE THIS IF YOU ARE A HTC FAN. YOU WONT LOVE THIS BABY IF YOU ARE A SAMSUNG FAN. THIS HANDSET HAS THE BEST BUILT QUALITY EVER. IT COMES WITH BEATS AUDIO, WHICH IS YET ANOTHER WIN FOR THE PHONE.
      
      
      PLUS:
      
      
      - 8 MP CAMERA WITH 1080P VIDEO RECORDING AT 30 FPS.
      
      - SUPER LCD 2 SCREEN.
      
      - BEATS AUDIO
      
      - QUAD CORE PROCESSOR
      
      - ANDROID 4.0 WITH HTC SENSE 4.0
      
      - GEFORCE GRAPHICS
      
      
      MINUS:
      
      - OVER PRICED (BUT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL FALL DOWN NEAR 30K)
      
      - NO SD CARD SLOT
      
      
      THIS WILL BE A BEST SMARTPHONE IF YOU ARE A GADGET FREAK."
HTC One X E720,5,"I'VE BEEN USING THIS MOBILE FOR THE PAST ONE MONT..I BOUGHT IT IN THE VERY FIRST WEEK OF ITS RELEASE...IT THE BEST ND HAS EVRTHING WHAT A MOBILE NEEDS..ITS LIKE USING A SMALL COMPUTER....EVERYTHING IN IT IS THE BEST OF ITS CLASS..MY ADVICE TO PEOPLE IS,, TO BUY IT RATHER THAN PREFERIN APPLE IPHONE 4S OR A GALAXY NOTE OR S2.... ITS REALLY GOOD I SWEAR.."
HTC One X E720,5,"JUST GET IT. IMO SMOKES THE S3 IN LOOKS DEPT AND MATCHES IT IN VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING ELSE. NEVER MIND THE FANCY STUFF IN THE UGLY S3.
      
      
      I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO AND GOT THE HTX ONE X.  DIDN'T KNOW ANDROID COULD FEEL SO SLICK"
HTC One X E720,5,"LIKE ME , THERE ARE MANY WHO KEEP THE HIGH END MOBILE AND THAT TOO FOR SHORT SPAN I.E. FOR TWO TO THREE MONTHS OR MAXIMUM FOR SIX MONTHS AND WITH EACH TIME, MAKE A PROMISE NOT TO CHANGE THE MOBILE AT LEAST FOR A YEAR BUT WHEN SOME NEW PHONE CAME, MIGHT BE WITH SOME UP GRADATION, CAN NOT RESIST OURSELF AND BREAK THE PROMISE AND PURCHASED A NEW ONE. BUT NOW I THINK, THAT TRADITION IS GOING TO BE CHANGED WITH PURCHASE OF HTC ONE X. THE PHONE WITH SO MUCH FEATURES AND THAT TOO SO ADVANCE THAT I AM NOT EVEN WAITING FOR  GALAXY S4, NOTE 3 OR IPHONE 5S. IF U HAVE NOT TRY THIS PHONE THEN IT'S A GENUINE ADVICE TO AT LEAST USE IT FOR ONE DAY AND U WILL REALLY FEEL THE TRUTH STATED IN THIS REVIEW."
HTC One X E720,5,"MY SISTER HAS BEEN USING THIS ONE...AND I HAVE ALSO GONE THROUGH THE FEATURES...SOFTWARE OF HTC IS A STAND OUT FROM OTHER COUNTERPARTS.....
      
      1.) DISPLAY : GOOD
      
      2.) EASY TO HOLD.
      
      3.) HAS AN PREMIUM LOOK TO IT.
      
      4.) BEATS AUDIO ENHANCEMENT IS GOOD(BASICALLY THE BASS OF THE SONG GETS CLEAR).
      
      5.) SMOOTH TOUCH/TRAVERSE THOUGH MENUS.
      
      6.) CAMERA QUALITY GOOD.  CAMERA SOFTWARE EXCELLENT. I LIKED THE FEATURE OF SWITCHING BETWEEN CAMERA AND VIDEO AT ONE SCREEN/TAKING PHOTOS IN BETWEEN VIDEO SESSION. QUITE APPRECIABLE.
      
      I HAVE FOUND TWO GLITCHES.....
      
      1.) WHENEVER IT PLAYS THE HIGH RESOLUTION (1080P) .MKV FORMAT(VIDEO)....THERE IS LAG OF THE IMAGE....WHICH YOU CAN OVERCOME WITH A MP4 CONVERTER....BUT CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WE ARE PAYING CLOSE TO RS.35000, I BELIEVE THESE FEATURES SHOULD BE INCLUDED....
      
      2.) WIFI HOTSPOT ISSUE(ALREADY CONNECTED CONNECTIONS).....SOMETIMES THE LAPTOP DOESN'T CONNECT TO YOUR MOBILE HOTSPOT....YOU WILL GET AN ERROR OF ""NOT ABLE TO CONNECT""....THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO DELETE THE CONNECTION IN YOUR LAPTOP AND ALSO RESTART THE PHONE...."

HTC One X E720,5,RELLY ITZ GOOD TO C SUCH GR8 FEATURES IN A FONE--UNLIKE I PHONE 4S D COST IS ALSO AFFORDABLE 4 D PEOPLE WHO R INTRSTD IN BUYING SMART FONES WID MOST UPDATED FEATURES...LOOKING 4WARD 4 SUM MORE THRILLING TECHNO BY HTC...
HTC One X E720,5,"SIMPLY AWESOME...
      
      1. EXCELLENT BUILT QUALITY. VERY STRONG (POLY CARBONATE BODY) AND ATTRACTING LOOKS (MATT FINISH)
      
      2. TOUCH IS REALLY REALLY GOOD. HTC SENSE IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN TOUCHWIZ.
      
      3. THE PHONE NEVER HANGS. ITS REALLY REALLY FAST.
      
      4. BATTERY: PEOPLE SAY HTC HAS POOR BATTERIES. NOT TRUE. THE ONE THEY HAVE INTRODUCED IN ONE X IS LI-PO BATTERY THAT CYCLE TIME OF WHICH WILL INCREASE ON REGULAR USAGE. MY BATTERY COMES FOR AROUND 1+1/4 DAYS ON AN AVERAGE. I CAN BET NO OTHER QUAD CORE WUD GIVE U SUCH A BATTERY CYCLE.
      
      
      FEW TIPS TO SAVE BATTERY:
      
      A. SET THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SCREEN TO AUTOMATIC
      
      B. NO PROBLEM EVEN UR WIFI AND 3G ARE SWITCHED ON ALL THE TIME. SWITCH THEM TO SMART SYNC; HTC IDLES THEM OUT IF IT FINDS THERE IS NO USAGE.
      
      
      THERE ARE NO COMPETITIVE PHONES IN THE MARKET FOR THIS NOW. NOT IN THE NEAR TERM!!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"SUPERB PHONE!!! I JUST BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND SERIOUSLY SPEAKING CAMERA IS JUST AMAZING. IT CAN EASILY BEAT ANY OTHER PHONE OF SAME CATEGORY IN TERMS OF CAMERA AND SOUND. IN FACT I PREFERRED IT OVER I-PHONE AND SAMSUNG S3.
      
      WELL IN TERMS OF BATTERY, IT WOULD BE BETTER IF HTC CAN PROVIDE 2100MHA BATTERY FOR BETTER RUNNING. WI FI IS SUPERFAST. RUNS APPLICATIONS FLAWLESSLY, LOOKS ARE KILLER, IT GRABS ATTENTION AT FIRST LOOK. HTC SENSE AGAIN BEATING OTHERS WITH A HUGE DIFFERENCE.
      
      
      A TRUE SMART PHONE!!! GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY."
HTC One X E720,5,THANK U HTC FOR MAKING THIS AWESOME AND POWERFUL DEVICE :) DITCHED SONY 4EVER AND WELCOMED HTC 4EVER :) THANKS AGAIN 2 HTC BUT NOT 2 4GET FLIPKART HEHE FOR SENDING ME THIS AWESOME PHONE :)
HTC One X E720,5,"THE FIRST ANDROID I USED... JUST THREE DAYS INTO THE PHONE N I FEEL PROUD...
      
      PROS:
      
      BEST DESIGN GREAT FEEL
      
      SUPER DISPLAY
      
      AWESOME PROCESSOR
      
      BEST CAMERA AROUND
      
      AMAZING INTERFACE... HTC SENSE ROCKS...
      
      
      CONS:
      
      ONLY THE BATTERY BACKUP(HAS A SLOUTION)
      
      LOWEST POSSIBLE BRIGHTNESS IN INDOORS, ONLY 30% WHEN OUTDOORS
      
      ACCOUNTS AND SYNC SETTINGS TURNED TO MANUAL( UNCHECKED)
      
      THATS IT N THIS THIS QUADCORE BEAST WILL BE WITH YOU FOR A LONG TIME...
      
      
      DONT GO FOR GALAXY S3 ITS A CHEAP MATERIAL MADE PHONE...WASTAGE OF MONEY..."
HTC One X E720,5,"THERE CANNOT BE A GREATER PROOF OF PHOTOS DOING A GADGET INJUSTICE THAN HTC ONE X. AS YOU HOLD THE REAL THING, YOU CAN NOT HELP BUT ADMIRE ITS ALL POLYCARBONATE UNI-BODY WITH PREMIUM MATTE FINISH, SPECIALLY AT THE BACK. TURN THE THING AROUND AND FEAST YOUR EYES ON ARGUABLY THE BEST SCREEN AROUND.THE 4.7 INCH HD SUPER LCD 2 WITH RGB MATRIX MAKES THE SCREEN SUPER SHARP, WITH GREAT COLORS AND VIEWING ANGLES. AND IT IS NOT AS IF THE DUO ARE TRYING TO HIDE INSIDE: THE PHONE ROCKS A TEGRA 3 T30 CHIP WITH 4 CORES CLOCKED AT 1.5GHZ AND A CAPABLE ULP GEFORCE GPU.
      
      
      HERE IS A LIST OF PROS AND CONS:
      
      PROS:
      
      1. ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS HARDWARE. THERE ARE NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT.
      
      2. 4.7 INCH SUPER LCD 2 BRINGS IN A PHENOMENAL BALANCE OF OVER-SATURATION AND TRUE COLORS. IT HAS GREAT CONTRAST FOR A LCD SCREEN AND VERY GOOD VIEWING ANGLES. RGB MATRIX MEANS IT HAS THE FULL SET OF 3 SUB-PIXELS TO FLAUNT.
      
      3. TEGRA 3 MIGHT NOT BE THE FASTEST CPU ANY MORE BUT IT STILL SCREAMS HIGH END. ALSO, THERE ARE MANY THD GAMES EXCLUSIVELY FOR TEGRA BASED MOBILES AND GADGETS ON THE PLAY STORE.
      
      4. 1GB RAM AND 32 GB INTERNAL MEMORY(NO MICRO SD CARD SLOT THOUGH).
      
      5. GREAT VIDEO PLAYER, WHICH PLAYS EVERYTHING YOU THROW AT IT(WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHAME OTHERWISE, GIVEN THE PLEASANT SCREEN).
      
      6. BEATS AUDIO
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. HTC PREFERS SLIMMER WAISTLINE MORE THAN A CAPABLE BATTERY. THE DOWNSIDES OF SUCH A DISPOSITION ARE APPARENT IN ONE X. 1800 MAH MAY NOT SOUND VERY MEASLY, THE REAL LIFE PERFORMANCE MAY SOMETIMES BE FRUSTRATING. LCD SCREENS GENERALLY NEED MORE JUICE, AND THE BATTERY SIMPLY FAILS TO STAND AGAINST THE COMPETITION.EVEN WITH NORMAL USE, IT MAY NOT LAST A DAY. BUT WOULD YOU BUY A ONE X TO PUT IT TO NORMAL USE?
      
      2. IT (STILL)RUNS ANDROID 4.0.4. CONSIDERING THAT QUITE A FEW PHONES RUN 4.1.1, AND NEXUS GADGETS ARE ALREADY RECEIVING 4.1.2, IT IS NOT SOMETHING FOR ONE X OWNERS TO BE PROUD OF.
      
      3. UNIMPRESSIVE CAMERA AND VIDEO RECORDING CAPABILITIES. TRADITIONALLY, THIS HAS BEEN AN AREA WHERE HTC HAVEN'T MADE MUCH EFFORT. OSTENSIBLY, ONE X IS A VICTIM OF THAT.
      
      
      COMPETITION:
      
      1. ANY HTC ONE X REVIEW WOULDN'T BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A REFERENCE TO SAMSUNG GALAXY S3. THE DUO ARE FIGHTING IT OUT AT THE TOP. ALTHOUGH S3 DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE IN TERMS OF BUILD QUALITY, IT OOZES PERFORMANCE IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. EXYNOS QUAD IS A BETTER PERFORMING SOC WITH AN EQUALLY GOOD-IF NOT BETTER CPU AND A VASTLY SUPERIOR MALI 400 GPU. IT HAS GREAT BATTERY BACKUP, BETTER IMAGING CAPABILITIES. ON THE SCREEN FRONT, S3 PRODUCES AMBITIOUS COLORS, BUT SOME PEOPLE MAY PREFER IT. ALSO, SAMSUNG IS DOING A BETTER JOB AT BRINGING OUT UPDATES, NOW THAT S3 IS ALREADY UPDATED TO JELLY BEAN. HOWEVER, FOR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A BETTER LOOKING PHONE AND WILLING TO LIVE WITH THE UNDER PERFORMING BATTERY, HTC ONE X MAY SUIT BETTER.
      
      2. NOKIA LUMIA 920 IS ON THE VERGE OF HITTING STORES. IT IS NECK AND NECK IN TERMS OF LOOKS AND OVERALL BUILD QUALITY HERE. 920 HAS A MUCH ADVERTISED SCREEN AND CAMERA. THE SNAPDRAGON S3 POWERED BY DUAL KRAIT CORES IS QUITE CAPABLE AS WELL. ALTHOUGH WINDOWS PHONE HASN'T HAD A GREAT START, TO BE FAIR WITH THE LUMIA, WINDOWS 8 PROMISES TO BRING A LOT ON THE TABLE WITH THINGS LIKE NATIVE CODE SUPPORT ETC. NEVERTHELESS, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN ANDROID DEVICE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE THIS A MISS.
      
      3. SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 IS ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE. WITH PROBABLY THE MOST POWERFUL SOC TO DATE(OPTIMUS G IS YET TO BE RELEASED) AN AMPLE SCREEN, IT WILL DEFINITELY BE BETTER AT WATCHING VIDEOS OR SURFING THE NET. ON THE DOWNSIDE, YOU MAY HAVE TO TAILOR ALL YOUR APPARELS TO SUIT THE HUMONGOUS PHONE.
      
      4. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, APPLE'S NEW IPHONE 5 MAY LOOK TINY, BUT IT CERTAINLY PACKS A PUNCH. WITH AN ALL CONQUERING GPU AND MANY MILLION APPS, IT WILL NEVER BE A BAD BUY."
HTC One X E720,5,"THIS HTC ONE X I WAS USING SINCE A 1MONTH.
      
      AND I REPLACED THIS PHONE 4TIMES.
      
      BUT STILL THIS PHONE GETS HEATED........
      
      
      NOW WHT SHOULD I DO.....??
      
      
      THIS PHONES DESIGN IS AWSOME. AND PROCESSOR IS ALSO BEST.
      
      AND ITS SOUND IS ALSO AWSOME, YOU LOVE ITS BEATS AUDIO SOUND..
      
      
      N I DONT LIKE S3 BEACAUSE SAME DESIGN ALL THE TIME."
HTC One X E720,5,THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER USED.THE CAMERA IS AWESOME THE LOOKS ARE KILLER AND THE FEATURES ARE UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING.I RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE COZ ITS THE BEST PHONE OUT THERE !!!!!
HTC One X E720,5,"THIS MOBILE IS THE BEST MOBILE I HAVE EVER OWNED.THE LAST PHONE I HAD WAS AN I PHONE  4S AND I THINK THIS IS A BETTER MOBILE EVEN   THOUGH THEY COST THE SAME.ALL I TS AMAZING FEATURES HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED BUT THE ONLY ONE THAT ISN'T MENTIONED THAT ITS
      
      SCREEN IS SCRATCH PROOF.......WOW!!!!!
      
      AND IF YOUR BUYING IT,IT ONLY COMES IN TWO COLORS WHITE AND BLACK,WHITE LOOKS MUCH BETTER....
      
      ITS SPEAKERS ARE FROM THE COMPANY BEATS BY DR.DRE
      
      IT IS A MUST BUY IF YOU WANT A GOOD MOBILE...........
      
      I LOVE IT"
HTC One X E720,5,"THIS PHONE IS AMAZING..!! ITS SUPER FAST..!! BLOWS AWAY YOUR MIND.. GAMING IS AWESOME.. EVEN THOUGH, THERE ARE ONLY VERY FEW GAMES THAT ARE TEGRA 3 OPTIMISED..!!
      
      ITS DEFINITELY THE BEST PHONE IN THE INDIAN MARKET CURRENTLY. AND ESPECIALLY SINCE SAMSUNG HAS NOT YET PLANNED THE LAUNCH FOR THE NEW GALAXY S III, THIS PHONE IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR YOU.. AND MOREOVER, THE HTC SENSE 4.0 IS SUPER COOL COMPARED TO THE TOUCHWIZ OF THE SAMSUNG GALAXY SERIES...!!
      
      I OWN THE HTC ONE X WHITE MODEL.. NO SCREEN BANDING ISSUES OR ANYTHING.. THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I AM FACING IS THE SWITCHING BETWEEN MAILBOXES IN THE MAIL APPLICATION.. I HAD REPORTED THAT TO HTC AND THEY REPLIED THAT THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT AND RELEASE A FOTA WITH THE BUG FIXES SOON..!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"THIS PHONE IS THE BEST ANDROID EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD. MY PREVIOUS PHONE WAS A SENSATION XE AND THE IPHONE 4S. HTC HAS PROVED IT AGAIN. EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE FAST, FROM OPENING APPS TO LOADING A WEB PAGE, EVERYTHING IS BLISTERING FAST. THE LOOKS ARE SO COOL. BEATS AUDIO INTEGRATION IS AN ADVANTAGE. QUAD CORE IS REALLY KICKING ITS JOB.
      
      
      SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT QUAD CORE IS NOT NECESSARY DUAL CORE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH, IT DRAINS BATTERY LIFE THESE ARE ALL SOME LAME COMMENTS FROM PEOPLE. NVIDIA TEGRA 3 PROCESSOR HAS A 5TH COMPANION CORE TO EXTEND THE BATTERY LIFE. THE COMPANION CORE LOOKS AFTER ALL THE LIGHT USAGE. THE MAIN CORES KICKS IN ONLY WHEN OPENING APPS OR PLAYING GAMES OTHERWISE ONLY THE COMPANION CORE LOOKS AFTER THE PHONE. I PERSONALLY GET A DAY OF BATTERY LIFE WITH NORMAL USAGE. NOWADAYS ALL SMARTPHONES GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF BATTERY LIFE. EVEN MY SENSATION XE AND THE IPHONE 4S LASTED ONLY A DAY LONG. SO PPL PLS STOP LEAVING LAME NEGATIVE COMMENTS REGARDING THE BATTERY."
HTC One X E720,5,"TO SIMPLY PUT IT FORWARD, IT'S THE BEST DEVICE OF HTC DEVICE EVER!!
      
      THE ANDROID 4.04(SENSE UI 4.1) UPDATE FIXED A LOT OF BUGS WHICH WERE PRESENT IN THE EARLIER VERSION. THOUGH IT STILL REQUIRES SOME MUTI TASKING TWEAKS AND FURTHER OPTIMIZATION OF SOFTWARE, TO HAVE THE OPTIMUM SENSE EXPERIENCE, THE WORK DONE BY HTC IS SUPERB!!
      
      THROWING LIGHT ON SOME OF THE CONS OF ONE X:
      
      1. STILL POOR BATTERY LIFE: REQUIRES CHARGING AT LEAST ONCE A DAY.
      
      2. CAMERA: SHOULD BE ABLE TO CAPTURE BETTER VIDEOS- 1080P AT FULL ""30"" FPS AND NOT JUST AT ""24""FPS. NOISE IN THE VIDEO AND STILL PICS HAS TO BE REDUCED.
      
      3. HEATING ISSUES: ONE X JUST HEATS UP AWFULLY WHEN PLAYING THD GAMES OR GRAPHIC INTENSIVE GAMES. PROBABLY THIS CANT BE FIXED(SIGH!).
      
      4. MULTI TASKING: STILLS NEEDS BETTER MULTI TASKING SUPPORT.MUST BE FIXED WITH THE JELLY BEAN UPDATE.
      
      REST EVERYTHING IS AWESOME ABOUT THIS DEVICE. EAGERLY WAITING FOR THE JELLY BEAN UPDATE!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"WELL FROM ALL PERSPECTIVE THIS PHONE IS GREAT.
      
      
      HTC ONE X HAVING GREAT HD DISPLAY AND SUPER FAST PROCESSING SPEED WITH 1.5 GH CORE QUAD PROCESSOR.
      
      
      BUT IF WE TALKING ABOUT CAMERA CLARITY AND BATTERY BACKUP, THIS PHONE IS LITTLE MUCH BEHIND THAN OTHER SMARTPHONE LIKE SAMSUNG S3."
HTC One X E720,5,"WHEN I WENT TO BUY A MOBILE.. I WAS NOT AT ALL THINKING ABOUT BUYING SUCH AN EXPENSIVE MOBILE. BUT WHEN I ENTERED IN SHOP..THE SHOP KEEPER SOME HOW MANAGED TO CONVINCE ME TO GO FOR IT..
      
      AND WHEN I RETURNED HOME I WASN'T THAT EXCITED SINCE I BOUGHT SOMETHING WHICH WAS A WAY HIGHER THAN MY BUDGET..
      
      THAT WAS DAY AND TODAY IS A DAY.. THIS PHONE HAS CHANGED MY THINKING COMPLETELY..
      
      I JUST LOVE THIS PHONE AND BELIEVE ME THIS PHONE IS WORTH OF MONEY TAG WRITTEN ON IT..SO HERE IS MY REVIEW ABOUT THINGS WHICH I COULD TEST ON THIS AMAZING DEVICE
      
      1. DISPLAY: TOP NOTCH..NOW I NO LONGER WATCH MOVIES ON MY LAPTOP..
      
      2. SOUND QUALITY: BEST IN MARKET. VERY AUTHENTICATE BEATS AUDIO SOUND EVEN ON THE HEADPHONES PROVIDED BY HTC. COULD NOT TEST IT ON BEATS AUDIO HEAD PHONES YET.. BUT THE ONE WHICH COME ALONG WITH PACKAGE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR BEAUTIFUL SOUND QUALITY
      
      3. PROCESSING SPEED: PERFECT.. I AM YET TO DISCOVER ANY APPLICATION WHICH CAN MAKE THIS DEVICE THINK TO LOAD AND PLAY..ALL HIGH GRAPHICS GAMES PLAY LIKE CHARM..
      
      4. CAMERA: NOT BEST IN MARKET (LIKE IPHONE) BUT DOES THE WONDERS. CLICKS QUIET CLEAR IMAGES AND FULL HD RECORDING MAKES U HAPPY..
      
      5. HANDLING: IN STARTING U MIGHT FEEL IT HUGE BUT AFTER COUPLE OF DAYS..IT PERFECTLY FITS IN YOUR PALM AND YOU CAN EASILY OPERATE IT IN CROWD TOO..
      
      5. BATTERY LIFE: IMPRESSIVE.. I CHARGE IT ONCE IN 2 DAYS (IT INCLUDES MODERATE USE LIKE PLAYING GAMES FOR LIKE COUPLE OF HOURS, WATCHING MOVIES FOR COUPLE OF HOURS, TALKING FOR COUPLE OF HOURS..SURFING FOR QUIET A SOME TIME ON WI-FI..)
      
      
      I PERSONALLY VERY PROUD OWNER OF THIS DEVICE..
      
      
      THANKS"
HTC One X E720,5,"WHOA!!!!! HTC FINALLY COMES INTO ITS MARKET-RULING PHASE. MY DAD GIFTED IT TO ME A FEW DAYS AGO AND TRUST ME, I FEEL LIKE KILLING ANYONE WHO SAYS HTC SUCKS.
      
      PROS OF THIS CELL:
      
      1. ICS 4.0, CHECK. ANDROID IS RULING THE MARKET AN HTC IS RUNNING ON ITS SUCCESS.
      
      2. QUAD-CORE, BRING ON THE HEAVY LOAD. GAMING ON THIS BABY IS MIND-BLOWING.
      
      3. SCREEN, PERFECT FOR EVERYONE. I HAD A GALAXY NOTE BEFORE THIS AND IT WAS AWKWARD. YES, IT WAS FUN TO BROWSE ON IT BUT IT FELT WEIRD WHEN YOU ARE TALKING TO SOMEONE ON IT. IPHONE'S 3.5"" IS WAY TOO SMALL. HTC FITS INTO THE SLOT PERFECTLY. IT'S NOT TOO SMALL NOR TOO LARGE. PLUS THE SCREEN IS EFFING CRISP.
      
      4. BEATS AUDIO. DO I REALLY NEED TO SAY ANYTHING?
      
      5. THE CAMERA. ALL OF YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE ""NICK JOJOLA"" AD. AND I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THAT GUY. I THINK ONLY THE NOKIA PUREVIEW 808 BEATS THIS CELL'S CAMERA (CONSIDERING THAT IT IS 1 MP, I AM NOT SHOCKED)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. THE BATTERY LIFE. WHEN YOU ARE USED TO A GALAXY NOTE, YOU FEEL DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU ARE USING THIS BEAST. BUT IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
      
      2. THE MONEY FACTOR. I HAD NO PROBLEMS GETTING THIS (I LOVE YOU DAD!), BUT THE COST IS WAYYYY TOO MUCH.
      
      3. I REALLY THINK IOS IS BETTER THAN ANDROID.
      
      4. MICROSIM. ONCE YOU CUT YOUR SIM, THERE'S NO GOING BACK.
      
      5. STORAGE. I THINK 32 GB IS NOT THAT MUCH. I'VE ALREADY FILLED IN ABOUT 27 GB (BUT THEN AGAIN, I AM ONE AWKWARD GUY. NORMAL PEOPLE WON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS)
      
      
      IN ALL, IT IS A CELL THAT WILL RAISE YOUR STATUS, GIVE YOU AWESOME PERFORMANCE, PICTURES AN MUSIC, AND MAKE YOUR FRIENDS JEALOUS WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT. SO, IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY, THEN GO FOR THIS WITHOUT ANY DOUBT. IF NOT, WELL... START COLLECTING FOR THIS!!!"
HTC One X E720,5,"WILL SHARE MY EXPERIENCE TO MY FELLOW INDIANS WHILE CHOOSING  A MOBILE. I AM NOT A GIZMO MAN, JUST WANTED TO GET A VERY GOOD PHONE AND MY EXPERIENCE WITH SAMSUNG WAS NOT THAT GOOD. SO THIS TIME I DECIDED TO GO FOR IPHONE5 BUT THAT FRUIT IS OUT OF STOCK ALREADY. THEN I THOUGHT OF GALAXY NOTE II BUT THAT WAS TOO BIG FOR A PHONE. U CAN USE THAT AS A TABLET THOUGH.
      
      I CHOSE HTC ONE X OVER THESE, AND I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH THAT. ITS PRETTY SLEEK/SLENDER AND POWERFUL.
      
      PROS :
      
      * BEATS AUDIO (5*), FULL MARKS AND AN ASSET TO  MUSIC LOVERS.
      
      *4.7 INCH HUGE SCREEN WITH HTC SENSE 4.0(4.5*) TRULY AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE
      
      * LOOK WISE ITS PRETTY SLEEK AND STYLISH.
      
      * QUAD CORE PROCESSOR WHICH IS BETTER THAN DUAL CORE ANY DAY.
      
      *8MP CAMERA(4*), CAPTURES VERY SHARP IMAGES IN DAYLIGHT AND @ NIGHT U NEED TO SHARP IT ACCORDING TO UR NEEDS OR ELSE IT BE BLUNT.
      
      *PRICE POINT IS ALSO A POSITIVE ANGLE TO THINK ABOUT.(UNLIKE 38K FR NOTE II ND 45.5K FOR IPHN5)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      * GPRS SETTINGS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONFIGURE AS MOST SERVICE PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE THIS PHONE IN THEIR LIST.
      
      *THERE ARE CERTAIN APPLICATIONS HTC SENSE 4.0 WHICH HARDLY RESPOND.
      
      E.G: IF U FLIP THE PHN OVER THE RINGTONE SHOULD STOP. BUT THAT DOES NOT WORK.THOUGH IT CAN BE A HANDSET SPECIFIC ISSUE.
      
      
      **AND PLEASE CHECK THE MARKET PRICE BEFORE ORDERING IN ONLINE SHOPPING MART****"
HTC One X E720,5,"WITH LATEST ICS GETTING AUTO UPDATED ON MY PHONE , THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER HAD . SUPER MIND BLOWING DESIGN .
      
      
      FEW FEATURES NOTICED .
      
      
      HTC CAR OPTION REALLY A GOOD FEATURE FOR THOSE WHO ARE A SELF DRIVER .
      
      
      GOOGLE VOICE RECOGNITION IS THE BEST TO SEND SMS .
      
      
      JUST DOWNLOADED SWIFT 3 KEYBOARD , BELIEVE ME ... I TYPE ANYTHING NEARBY TO WHAT I WANT , IT IS RIGHT ON SCREEN. BETTER THAN SWIPE IF YOU WANT TO USE 2 HANDS . FOR ONE HAND SWIPE IS BETTER .
      
      
      BATTERY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER , BUT NO REGRET ... WITH SO MUCH OF FEATURES LOADED , WE CANNOT EXPECT TOO MUCH ."
HTC One X E720,5,"YES, THAT IS MY ONE WORD FOR MY HTC ONE X, ""POWER"". ANDROID PHONES HAVE LONG BEEN RESTRICTED BY PROCESSING, WHETHER DOING MULTITASKING OR NOT. I OWNED SONY XPERIA NEO V BEFORE THIS AND I OFTEN FELT A HINT OF LAG WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN APPS OR CLOSING A GAME OR SOMETHING. BUT THE DAY I OWNED HTC ONE X, I FELT THAT UNMATCHED POWER, SMOOTHNESS BEYOND COMPARISON, APPS OPENING, SWITCHING LIKE STACK OF CARDS WITH ABSOLUTE ZERO LAG IN BETWEEN. SO WITHOUT GOING ALL GAGA OVER MY NEW PHONE I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION SOME PROS &AMP; CONS(BARELY) THAT I FOUND WITH MY 1 MONTH USAGE OF THIS PHONE:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. A BEAUTIFUL SEAMLESS POLY-CARBONATE BODY: YOU CANNOT SIMPLY GET A PRETTIER LOOKING PHONE THAN THIS.
      
      2. POWERFUL: NVIDIA TEGRA, 1.5 GHZ QUAD-CORE PROCESSOR WITH ULP GEFORCE GPU. GAMES LIKE SHADOWGUN, GTA IV, TEMPLE RUN, BECOME OBSESSION ON THIS PHONE SO BEWARE.
      
      3. BRILLIANT DISPLAY: YES IT BEATS SAMOLED TECHNOLOGY EASY WAY. ITS CALLED SUPER IPS LCD2, WITH RGB MATRIX AND A PIXEL DENSITY OF 312 PPI, WHICH PRODUCES MORE NATURAL, MORE VIVID DISPLAY, UNLIKE PENTILE MATRIX OF SAMOLED WHICH HAS DISARRAYED PIXELS.
      
      4. BEATS AUDIO: THE BEATS AUDIO BY DR DRE REALLY PUTS A PUNCH IN THE AUDIO QUALITY. LIKE IT SAYS, THE BASS IS DECENT CREATING A MORE BALANCED OUTPUT, WITH NEITHER TOO BIASED ON LOWS, MIDS OR HIGHS.
      
      
      THESE ARE THE 4 BASIC, MOST PROMINENT STRENGTHS OF THIS PHONE, WHICH CANNOT BE MATCHED BY SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 OR IPHONE. PEOPLE WHO COMPARE SGS3 WITH ONE X ARE FOOLS, MISGUIDED BY THE SAMSUNG GALAXY LEGACY PHONES, WHO DON'T RESEARCH AND LOOK UPON FACTS BEFORE COMPARING THEM.
      
      NOW I WILL HONESTLY STATE THE CONS, WHICH I THINK ARE RESTRICTING THE PHONE A LITTLE, BUT AGAIN ITS MY OPINION.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. BATTERY: PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT 4 DAY BATTERY LIFE OF AN ANDROID TOUCH PHONE. THAT SAID, ONE X PROVIDES A FULL 2 DAY BATTERY BACKUP WITH DECENT USAGE WHICH INCLUDES MAKING CALLS, BROWSING, PLAYING TEMPLE RUN, MUSIC, LITTLE BIT OF VIDEO PLAYBACK.
      
      2. AUDIO PLAYER: I FOUND A LITTLE GLITCH IN THE DEFAULT MUSIC PLAYER OF THIS PHONE. WHILE PLAYING SONGS, THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE SONG LIST IS HIT THE TOP LEFTMOST BUTTON TO GO BACK. OR YOU CAN SIMPLY PLAY BACK THROUGH THE PLAYLIST CONTINUOUSLY. WELL THIS CAN BE AVOIDED BY INSTALLING ANY MUSIC PLAYER APP LIKE POWERAMP, PLAYERPRO OR WINAMP.
      
      3. NOTHING!
      
      
      FOR ME, ITS THE BEST ANDROID DEVICE TILL DATE WITH THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY YOU CAN GET. UNLIKE 4K BUCKS COSTLIER SGS3. AND I DON'T FIND ANY VIABLE REASON FOR PURCHASING SGS3 OVER THIS PHONE. ITS HAVING A LITTLE BIGGER BATTERY THAT'S ALL. DON'T THINK SGS3 WOULD GIVE YOU A 4 DAY BACKUP WITH THAT, IN CASE YOU'RE THINKING.
      
      
      HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL. THANKS!"
HTC One X E720,4,"AT 37K THIS IS NOT A GOOD OPTION. AS SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS LAUNCHING ON MAY 3, IT WILL GIVE IT A TOUGH COMPETITION SO ITS OBVIOUS THAT PRICES WILL FALL TO SOME WHERE AROUND 28-30K. AT THAT PRICE IT WILL BE A GOOD BUY.NEVER THE LESS THIS IS A SUPER PHONE PRESENTLY ONE CAN BUY."
HTC One X E720,4,"BOUGHT THIS FROM FLIPKART AROUND A WEEK BACK. DELIVERY WAS DONE IN 2 DAYS FLAT. D FLIPKART WAY :)
      
      PHON HAD BATTERY OVERHEATING ISSUE. GT A DOA CERTIFICATE FROM HTC SERVICE CENTRE AND GOT REPLACEMENT FROM FLIPKART IN ANOTHER 2 DAYS. THE NEW ONE WORKS FINE.
      
      PROS: PHONE IS AMAZING WITH LIGHTENING FAST PERFORMANCE (THE QYAD CORE SHOWS), GREAT SOUND QUALITY(WITH HEADPHONES AND BEATS AUDIO SWITCHED ON), THE BEST DISPLAY QUALITY, VERY USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE (FAR BETTER THAN SAMSUNG TOUCHWIZ)
      
      CONS: BATTERY LIFE IS AVERAGE(CAN STRETCH A FULL DAY WITH MEDIUM USAGE), CAMERA IS DISAPPOINTING IN TERMS OF CLARITY ESPECIALLY INDOOR PICS.
      
      JBL BUGG SPEAKERS THAT CAME FREE, ADDED TO THE FUN. PERFECT GADGET TO TAKE ALONG ON TRIPS."
HTC One X E720,4,"EVERYONE HERE ARE CRYING ABOUT THE MARKETING STRATEGY OF HTC &AMP; ARE SAYING IT HAD POOR SUPPORT &AMP; ADVICE'S.
      
      
      BUT ????...........
      
      
      HTC ONE X+ SCORES WAY ABOVE ONE X IN ALMOST ALL DEPARTMENTS WHILE THERE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE WHY IT IS PRICED ABOVE 1 X+..
      
      
      ***THAT IS GRAPHIC PROCESSING UNIT (GPU)......YES ONE X COMES WITH ULP GE FORCE WHICH ONE X+ DIDN'T ...ITS NOT A MISTAKE OF FLIPKART FOR NOT NAMING GPU BECAUSE I EVEN CONFIRMED MYSELF FROM HTC'S OFFICIAL WEBSITE:-)
      
      
      NO NEED TO EXPLAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF GPU..ONE X WITH GPU EASILY BEATS THE FASTER PROCESSOR OF ONE X+ EASILY ON ANY DAY.....
      
      
      ONE &AMP; ONLY ONE PROBLEM IS BATTERY..IT TOO IS VERY IMP....
      
      RECENTLY THERE WERE FEW COMPLAINTS HERE &AMP; THERE REGARDING ITS CAMERA( NOT FOR ALL)
      
      .I THINK WHEN HTC CUT PRICES OF ONE X &AMP; X+, THEY MIGHT HAVE LOWERED THE QUALITY OF CAMERA IS WELL......
      
      
      THEIR WEBSITE CLAIMS THAT THESE SMARTPHONES COMES OUT WITH BEATS HEADPHONE BUT COMES WITH LOW QUALITY STEREO ONES...
      
      
      MY SINCERE ADVICE IS TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER DEVICES IN &AMP; OUT HTC ..
      
      
      IF YOU ARE NOT A BRAND FREAK,THEN LOOK AT XOLO PLAY T1000 WITH SIMILAR SPECS WITH LOW MEMORY @16K ONLY BUT WITH JB 4.1, YOU CAN INSTALL APPS ON SD CARD AS XOLO Q800 DOES SO NO PROBLEM AT ALL..ALL XOLO NEEDS TO IMPROVE IS ITS SERVICE...IF YOU ARE, THEN LOOK AT G NEXUS 4..
      
      
      REGARDS,
      
      S V REDDY."
HTC One X E720,4,"HEY ,I BOUGHT THIS SUPERB PHONE JUST A WEEK AGO.
      
      ITS REALLY A VERY VERY VERY SMART SMARTPHONE.
      
      A COMPLETE PHONE.
      
      PEOPLE CONFUSED B/W BUYING S3 N ONE X SHUD DEFINITLEY GO FOR ONE X AS IT HAS ADDITIONAL FEATURES LIKE HTC SENSE.
      
      
      BIG THING :- PRICE
      
      
      IN INDIA HER AT FLIPKART ITS AVAILABLE AT 32K
      
      BUT I BOUGHT FROM DUBAI AT A CHEAPER RATE ,VERY CHEAP RATE ..8K LESSER THAN WHATZ BEING SOLD HERE.
      
      WITH BILL AND WITH WARRANTY AND GUARANTEE OF 1 YEAR.."
HTC One X E720,4,"HI ALL. I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE (NOT FROM FLIPKART THOUGH) AND HAVE FOUND IT TO BE TRULY FAST AND SMOOTH.
      
      GOOD THINGS:-
      
      1) VERY GOOD WHITE COLOUR BODY COMPARED TO CHEAP PLASTIC ON S3
      
      2) VERY GOOD INTERFACE. HTC SENSE IS AMAZING.
      
      3) BRILLIANT SOUND ON THE EARPHONES PROVIDED IN THE BOX (BEATS AUDIO IS COOOOL)

      5) AMAZING TOUCHSCREEN
      
      6) LOOKS VERY GOOD COMPARED TO ANY OTHER PHONE. HTC HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB WITH THE LOOKS
      
      7) DECENT BATTERY BACKUP. DO NOT GET SCARED ABOUT BATTERY BACKUP AFTER READING OTHER REVIEWS, ITS NOT THAT BAD. U CAN RELY ON MY OPINION REALLY. TRUST ME COZ BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE I READ ABOUT 1000 REVIEWS ABOUT THE BATTERY LIFE.
      
      8) VERY GOOD FEATURES. NOT BORING AS SAMSUNG/LG
      
      
      BAD THINGS :-
      
      1. NON REMOVABLE BATTERY.
      
      2. BATTERY SAME AS PROVIDED ON HTC ONE X PLUS WUD HV BEEN COOL
      
      3. SPEAKER PROVIDED COULD AVE BEEN BETTER.
      
      4. CHARGER WIRE IS SMALL.
      
      
      MY ADVICE:-
      
      PLSSSSSSS GET THIS PHONE IN WHITE. IT LOOKS RICH (I GOT IT IN WHITE EVEN THOUGH BLACK IS MY FAVOURITE).....BLACK LOOKS SICK ON THIS PHONE
      
      IF U ARE AN AVERAGE USER 16GB MEMORY IS ENOUGH. DON'T GET MEMORY CONCIOUS.
      
      DO NOT WORRY BEFORE BUYING THIS BEAUTY. ITS REALLY GOOD.
      
      
      ALSO, MORE IMPORTANTLY AS I HV READ IN SOME REVIEWS ABOUT THE SCREEN BREAKING - ITS NOTHING AS SUCH...SCREEN QUALITY IS GOOD AND FEELS STRONG THAN S3
      
      
      BOTTOM LINE - HTC ONE X+ IS BETTER IN A FEW ASPECTS BUT IF U DON'T HV THAT BUDGET THIS IS ROCKING. DO NOT WORRY AT ALL.
      
      
      GO FOR HTC IF U ARE A FIRST TIME USER. A CHANGE FROM SAMSUNG/LG/NOKIA WILL MAKE U HAPPY. THIS HTC PHONE REALLY HAS A RICH FEEL.
      
      
      ONE STAR LESS IS JUST BECAUSE A BATTERY OF 2100MAH WUD HV BEEN BETTER THAN 1800MAH ON THIS. BUT STILL ITS VERY VERY DECENT"
HTC One X E720,4,"HI CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT TO CHOOSE HTC ONE X+ . HTC ONE X+ IS AVAILABLE AT LESS PRICE COMPARED TO HTC ONE X 32 GB . HTC ONE X+ HAS MORE FEATURE COMPARED TO ONE X . IS THERE ANY PROBLEM WITH THIS DEVICE , CAN I BUY THIS ONE . I ALSO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE RAM AS ONLY 300 TO 350 MB WILL BE FREE SPACE AND REST WILL BE FILLED BY THE PREINSTALLED APPS , SO CAN I INSTALL AS MANY APPS I WANT AFTER PURCHASE AND ALSO ABOUT BATTER BACKUP.
      
      THANKS IN ADVANCE"
HTC One X E720,4,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR PAST 2 MONTHS, EXCELLENT DEVICE WITH POOR BATTERY LIFE. BEATS AUDIO AND BODY DESIGN IS THE PLUS. I HAVE TO DISABLE LOT OF FEATURES TO USE THE PHONE, BUT KEEPING CHARGER EVERY PLACE U CAN OVERCOME THE BATTERY ISSUE."
HTC One X E720,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE A WEEK AGO (NOT FROM FLIPKART) AND I JUST LOVE IT...
      
      THE ONLY BAD I THINK IS THE BATTERY, IT DRAINS VERY FASTER..
      
      THE SOLUTION IS THAT, WHEN YOU UNPACK THE PHONE, JUST DO NOT SWITCH IT ON RIGHT AWAY, LET IT CHARGE COMPLETELY, THE LED INDICATOR WILL TURN GREEN, LET IT BE LIKE THAT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES MORE, AND THEN YOU CAN START USING THE PHONE...
      
      THIS IS BECAUSE THE PHONE NEEDS TO CALLIBERATE ITS BATTERY.
      
      ALSO SINCE THE CAMERA IS A BULGING OUT OF THE PHONE, TAKE PAIN TO BUY A COVER (BE IT SILICON OR WHATEVER).
      
      THE PHONE IS COMPLETELY A BEAST, I WOULD RECOMMEND TO KEEP ITS SOFTWARE UP TO DATE..
      
      I WANTED TO GIVE IT 4.5 STARS BUT NO OPTION SO GIVING 4 STARS.."
HTC One X E720,4,"I RECOMMENDED THIS PHONE TO ONE OF MY FRIEND , AND BROUGHT THIS PHONE FOR HIM
      
      THIS PHONE IS BEAST OF ALL ANDROID PHONES IT HAS AWESOME CAMERA
      
      THE ONLY PHONE WITH FASTEST UPDATES NOW THIS PHONE HAS JELLY BEAN UPDATE ALREADY :D
      
      THE ONLY PHONE WITH UNIQUE UI AND HTC SENSE :)
      
      THE BATTERY IS BIT DISAPPOINTING THOUGH STILL THE PHONE IS AWESOME.
      
      
      BUY AND JUDGE :)"
HTC One X E720,4,"I WAS BIT OF NOKIA FAN, THIS WAS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE.
      
      AFTER COMPARING WITH SIII AND ONE X, I MADE DECISION TO GO WITH ONE X WHICH I GOT WITH A JBL SPEAKER.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      STURDY BUILD QUALITY.
      
      FINISHING OF BACKCOVER WAS A MATT, WHICH DOESN'T LEAVE ANY HANDPRINTS LIKE THE SONY.
      
      I WAS USING THIS PHONE FOR ALMOST 1 YEAR NOW, AND TILL NOW THE BACK COVER COLOR HASN'T CHANGED YET.
      
      THE DISPLAY IS BEST AND CLEAR UNDER THE SUN.
      
      THE CAMERA IS BEST AND COMPARED TO NOKIA CAMERAS, THIS ONE IS BEST,
      
      AS I HAVE SEEN THE CAMERA IN SAMSUNG OR SONY WHICH IS NOT EVEN NEAR TO THIS.
      
      THE PROCESSOR IS AWESOME, AND I COULD PLAY ANY GAMES SO EASY TOUCH.
      
      THE UI IS REALLY ASTONISHING.
      
      THE BATTERY IS ALSO UPTO THE MARK
      
      
      CONS:
      
      THE PHONE GETS HEATED IF PLAYED HIGH END GRAPHICS GAMES
      
      THE BATTERY CANNOT BE REPLACED/REMOVED, BUT THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE, AS I DIDNT FIND ANY ISSUES.
      
      NO FEATURE FOR EXTERNAL STORAGE, THIS ALSO DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE FOR ME AS THIS COMES WITH 32GB INBUILT STORAGE.
      
      THE VIDEO DOESN'T PLAY ALL FILES, BUT WITH THE THIRD PARTY VIDEO SOFTWARE FROM ANDROID STORE THIS DOESN'T MATTER"
HTC One X E720,4,"IF U R LOOKING FOR A PHONE WITH GOOD CAMERA THIS IS NOT FOR U .. CAMERA'S STILL PICS ARE NOT GOOD ... IMAGES CLICKED ARE NOISY  ,  BUT THE VIDEO QUALITY IS GOOD .. OTHERWISE THE PHONE IS GREAT . DESIGN &AMP; LOOK WISE ONE X IS AWSUM .."
HTC One X E720,4,"I'VE BEEN USING THIS FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS NOW AND I MUST SAY AM HOOKED ON TO IT. A GREAT BUY IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY. ONE OF THE MOST COOLEST FEATURES I'VE COME ACROSS IS THE *SLOW MOTION RECORD*  OPTION. ITS SO COOL. NO DOUBT THE VIDEO QUALITY FALLS BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN SKIP. THE GAMING EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THE BEST AS OF NOW. FOR ALL THOSE WHO WOULD SAY THAT IPHONE IS THE BEST, I AGREE BUT THE ONE X IS NO LESS. AMAZING COLORS GREAT DISPLAY.
      
      I WISH IT COULD COME WITH THE BEATS HEAD/EAR PHONES BUT IT COMES WITH THE REGULAR HTC EAR PHONES WHICH HAVE GREAT OUTPUT BUT LACK THE BASS EFFECT.
      
      ALL IN ALL A GUY INVESTMENT.
      
      4/5."
HTC One X E720,4,"REASONS I LIKE IT:
      
      1.	CAMERA: ONE WORD, HONEST. NO PRETENSIONS, NO FALSE BOOSTING OF COLORS, OVERSHARPENING OR ANYTHING ELSE. THOUGH, THERE IS A BUG IN ZOOM FUNCTION (IN BOTH THE HANDSETS I USED); WHENEVER I ZOOM, IT SHOOTS TO THE MAXIMUM LEVEL OF ZOOM, DOESN?T STOP AT INTERMEDIATE LEVELS
      
      2.	SOUND: THIS PHONE SAVED ME 9K INR THAT I WOULD HAVE SPENT ON BOSE. THE HIGHS, MIDS OR LOWS; I MISS NONE.
      
      3.	BUILT: I AM NOT SURE BUT THIS IS CALLED UNIBODY DESIGN RIGHT? THOUGH I HAD TO SACRIFICE THE PLEASURE OF REPLACEABLE BATTERY, BUT WHEN I SEE AT THIS SEAMLESS WHITE SHELL; IT IS WORTH SPENDING FEW BUCKS ON A PORTABLE POWER BANK. THE POLYCARBONATE IS BETTER THAN METAL OR ANY NONSENSE KEVLAR THING. THOSE AWFULLY BOXY SAMSUNGS CAN SUCK ON THESE CURVES.
      
      4.	PERFORMANCE: THE SECOND ONE X HAS NEVER LET ME WAITING FOR ANYTHING TO OPEN. AGAIN, I DIDN?T TEST ANY BIG GAMES SO FAR, BUT SO FAR IT HAS BEEN AWESOME IN MULTITASKING.
      
      
      REASONS I AM REPLACING THIS:
      
      
      1.	HEATING ISSUE: I HAVE PLAYED NO GAMES SO FAR ON THIS PHONE, BUT THE AREA AROUND THE LENS GETS HOT WHILE I AM BROWSING WEB OVER 2G. AND THE TEMPERATURE IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME WAIT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BEFORE BRINGING IT NEAR MY EAR. REASON CERTAINLY IS NOT THE SCREEN, BECAUSE PLAYING THE VIDEO NEVER HEATS IT UP.
      
      2.	THE SCREEN: THIS IS MY SECOND PHONE (REPLACED PREVIOUS ONE DUE TO A LOT OF BUGS). AND SO FAR I HAVE OBSERVED STRANGE WHILE LINES/GREY SHADES ON THE EDGES OF THE DISPLAY. SIMILAR ISSUE WAS PRESENT IN THE PREVIOUS ONE AS WELL. AND THE DEALER WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID, ?IT IS SCRATCH RESISTANT, NOT SCRATCH PROOF?.
      
      3.	THE CAMERA: YESTERDAY, I LAUNCHED THE CAMERA AND THE SCREEN FLASHED BRIGHTLY IN WHITE, RED BLACK FOR A MINUTE, AND THEN THE CAMERA STARTED.
      
      4.	DOWNLOAD: GOT MY MICRO SIM REPLACED TWICE, BUT DOWNLOADING FILES OF ANY KIND (ATTACHMENT FROM GMAIL/YAHOO, APPS FROM PLAYSTORE, OR SIMPLE SOFTWARE UPGRADE) IS NOT POSSIBLE. ATTEMPTS IN SAFEMODE ALSO FAILED. THE SAME SIM WORKS FINE IN OTHER PHONES."
HTC One X E720,4,"THE HTC ONE X IS SUCH A DELIGHT. IT IS FAST, FLUID, GOOD LOOKING AND REFRESHING.
      
      
      THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA WHERE IT BEATS THE GALAXY S3 AND THE XPERIA LINE OF SMARTPHONES IS THE DESIGN THE ANDROID INTERFACE. S3 LOOKS CHEAP AND XPERIA ALSO DOES NOT OFFER MUCH TO THE EYE. HTC ON TH OTHER HAND IS GOOD-LOOKING+THE HTC SENSE IS SO GOOD AND REFRESHING. THE TOUCHWIZ ON SAMSUNG IS BLAND. SAME IS THE CASE WITH XPERIA.
      
      
      PROS:-
      
      1.) VERY GOOD BODY MATERIAL. DURABLE.
      
      2.) THE SCREEN IS VERY BRIGHT AND RESOLUTIONARY.
      
      3.) BEATS AUDIO TAKE YOUR EARPHONE EXPERIENCE TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
      
      4.)ANDROID 4.2 PLUS HTC SENSE 4+ ARE THE BEST EXPERIENCED ON HTC.
      
      5.) SERIOUSLY, AMAZING CAMERA WITH LOADS OF EFFECTS PLUS ABILITY TO RECORS SLOW MOTION VIDEOS.
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      1.) BATTERY LIFE IS NORMAL. ALL CAN SURVIVE 1.5 DAYS ON A FULL CHARGE.
      
      2.) CORNING GORILLA GLASS IN MY VIEW DOESN'T PROTECT FROM SCRATCHES.
      
      
      IT'S A GREAT PHONE FOR EVERY PENNY YOU SPEND ON IT. I GIVE IT 4/5 FOR BATTERY+GORILLA GLASS ISSUE."
HTC One X E720,4,THIS IS A SUPER PHONE(WHITE) BUT GETS SUPER DIRTY SUPER FAST. THE HTC SENSE IS NEAT.. EVERYTHING OPERATES SUPER FAST.. CAM NOT THAT GREAT.. AND IT HEATS UP A BIT.. NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BATTERY CHARGE.. SO FAR. THE PHONE FEELS SOLID AND SITS PERFECT IN YOUR PALM. LUV IT.
HTC One X E720,4,"THIS IS AN AWESOME PHONE...WORKS LIKE BUTTER. TOUCH SUPER RESPONSIVE AND CAMERA IS A BEAST.THE ONLY THING IS THAT YOU GET AN AN ALMOST EQUALLY GOOD PHONE. THE XOLO A900.
      
      IT HAS 1.6 GHZ WITH INTEL ATOM PROCESSER, A 4 INCH SCREEN, 8 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA, A FRONT FACING  CAMERA AND MUCH MORE. YOU SHOULD GO CHECK IT OUT."
HTC One X E720,4,"THIS IS JUST AN AWESOME PHONE WITHOUT ANY DOUBT , JUST LOVE IT....EARLIER IT HAD LITTLE HEATING PROBLEM WHILE PLAYING GAME THAT ALSO RESOLVED AFTER UPDATE RECEIVED FROM HTC (DONT KNOW HOW BUT NOW I AM NOT EXPERENCING ANY HEATING ISSUE) , GO FOR IT ...AMAZING SOUND , AMAZING CAMERA. BATTERY IS A LITTLE CONCERN BUT THAT'S ALSO OKAY...1 DAY BATTERY BACKUP ...
      
      
      REGARDS
      
      NAVEEN"
HTC One X E720,4,"WELL THIS PHONE IS A BEAST I HAVE INSTALLED HIGH END GAMES ON IT LIKE FIFA 12 , NOVA 3 , IRON MAN 3 , REAL FOOTBALL 2013 AND EVEN NEED FOR SPEED MOST WANTED THESE ALL GAMES RUNS LIKE SPREADING BUTTER ON BREAD WELL ITS AWESME BT
      
      
      DESIGN- WELL I KNOW ITS POLYCARBONATE BT THE FEEL IS SO PREMIUM AND IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKE SAMSUNG
      
      
      BATTERY - FAIR ENOUGH BT NOT SO GOOD
      
      
      CAMERA - I. FRONT CAMERA SUCKS AND ITS JST SO BAD
      
      II. REAR CAMERA IS SO AWESME
      
      
      BT DON'T GO FOR IT GO FOR HTC ONE X+"
HTC One X E720,4,"WELL, MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE PHONE AND YOU CAN PROBABLY GET PLENTY DETAILS IN OTHER REVIEWS. SO, I WILL JUST SUM UP MY EXPERIENCE AFTRE 7 MONTHS OF USE.
      
      
      PROS :
      
      ------
      
      - THE UI (HTC SENSE) MAKES IT THE BEST ANDROID EXPERIENCE AMONGST ALL ITS PEERS
      
      - THE ""PHONE FUNCTIONS"" OF THE PHONE WORK WELL. CONNECTIVITY IS FAR BETTER THAN MOST OTHER SIMILARLY PRICED PHONES, THOUGH A CHEAP NOKIA WILL STILL GET YOU A SIGNAL WHERE THIS WON'T.
      
      - THE CAMERA IS GREAT. THE HDR MODE IS A FANTASTIC FEATURE
      
      - 32GB OF BUILT-IN MEMORY IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
      
      - WORKS SMOOTHLY WITH NO LAG. I HAVE LOTS OF APPS, MANY RUNNING CONSTANTLY. PHONE HAS HUNG ONLY ONCE IN 7 MONTHS. RESTART WAS NO ISSUE.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      -------
      
      - BATTERY LIFE IS PATHETIC. YOU WILL BE LUCKY IF IT LASTS YOU ANYTHING CLOSE TO YOUR WORKING DAY. I HAD TO BUY A CAR CHARGER AND A PORTABLE BATTERY PACK TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I CHARGE IT AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. SO, THE BATTERY LIFE HAS ME CONSTANTLY WORRIED. TAKES ALL THE PLEASURE OUT OF USING THE PHONE. 3G, WIFI &AMP; POOR SIGNALS DRAIN THE BATTERY EVEN MORE QUICKLY. FIRMWARE / OTA FIXES FROM HTC HAVE HARDLY HELPED.
      
      - THE MIC IS NOT GOOD. NO COMPLAINTS WHEN TALKING, BUT POOR PERFORMANCE AS A VOICE RECORDER
      
      - I TRAVEL A LOT AND PICK UP SIMS ABROAD WHEN POSSIBLE. ITS BEEN A PAIN CUTTING UP SIMS TO MICRO-SIM SIZE. IF THE GALAXY S3 COULD MANAGE WITH A REGULAR SIM, WHY COULDN'T HTC. SWITCHING SIMS BETWEEN MY PHONES IS A PAIN BECAUSE OF THIS.
      
      
      SUMMARY :
      
      -----------
      
      - BUY IT, BUT THEN BUY A BACKUP BATTERY CHARGER TOO (A PORTABLE ONE, LIKE WHAT BELKIN OFFERS). THE ANDROID EXPERIENCE IS FANTASTIC ON THIS PHONE
      
      - WOULD RECOMMEND THE HTC ONE X+, BUT I HAVE HEARD EVEN THAT PHONE'S BATTERY DOESN'T INSPIRE CONFIDENCE.
      
      
      I WISH HTC WOULD HAVE MADE THE PHONE 2MM THICKER AND 20GMS HEAVIER, BUT USED THAT FOR A BIGGER BATTERY AND A FULL SIZED SIM. AN EXTERNAL SD CARD SLOT WOULD HAVE HELPED TOO. UNFORTUNATELY THE SEALED BODY MEANS I CANNOT CARRY AROUND &AMP; EXCHANGE THE INTERNAL BATTERY. I DO HOPE WHEN I GO TO CHANGE THE BATTERY IN A FEW MONTHS TIME, I CAN GET ONE OF A HIGHER CAPACITY."
HTC One X E720,4,"WHY SPEND 38K IF YOU CAN GET BETTER PHONE SONY XPERIA S IN 31K.SONY HAVIN 12MP CAMERA WHERE HTC HAVING 8.NO NEED TO TELL ABOUT SOUND AND DISPLAY QUALITY OF SONY.I WILL NOT WRITE MUCH.YOU CAN GO AND COMPARE THEM.OVERALL,PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE BEST BUT NOT VALUE FOR MONEY...."
HTC One X E720,4,"YES GUYS LG HAS DECIDED TO LAUNCH THE LG OPTIMUS 4X HD WHICH ALSO WILL BE SEEN IN FLIPKART VERY SOON.. IT HAS THE BEST PROCESSORS,OR YOU CAN A BEAUTY WITH LOT OF BRAINS AND POWER YOU CHECK IT ON GOOGLE THE SPECS AND EVERYTHING WHAT YOU WANT...EVEN THE SAMSUNGS GALAXY S3 IS FAR BEHIND FROM SPECS.."
HTC One X E720,3,"DEBATING BETWEEN THE GALAXY S3 AND THE HTC ONE X, I FINALLY SETTLED FOR THIS. I HAVE OWNED THE S2 PRIOR TO THIS, SO I AM NO STRANGER TO POWERHOUSE PHONES. I HAVE TO ADMIT HERE THAT I WAS, AND STILL AM, A HUGE FAN OF THE GALAXY S2 - I DID NOT WANT TO UPGRADE IN FACT, BUT THIS WAS A GIFT :-).
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. PERFORMANCE - AS GOOD AS ONE CAN EXPECT FROM THIS KIND OF CONFIGURATION, BUT THEN EVEN WITH THE S2 I NEVER FOUND ANY APPLICATION THAT WAS SLOW. PERHAPS THE SOFTWARE NEEDS TO CATVH UP WITH THE HARDWARE HERE.
      
      2. THE DISPLAY - I THOUGHT THE SAMOLED ON THE S2 WAS BRILLIANT, BUT IT'S PEDESTRIAN COMPARED TO THIS. THIS WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT TILTED ME IN FAVOUR OF THIS COMPARED TO THE S3.
      
      3. SENSE UI - SAMSUNG'S TOUCHWIZ IS HORRIBLE, TO PUT IT MILDLY. SENSE IS WAY BETTER, ALTHOUGH I'D STILL PREFER THE CLEAN LOOK OF CYANOGEN.
      
      4. BATTERY LIFE - THE BATTERY WILL SUFFER IF YOU'RE PLAYING WITH IT ALL THE TIME (PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE FANTASTIC DISPLAY), BUT THE STANDBY BATTERY TIME OF THIS PHONE IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING (WITH CUSTOM ROMS OF COURSE). I HAVE SEEN IT LOSE LESS THAN 1% OVERNIGHT.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. NOT AS ROOT-FRIENDLY AS SAMSUNG: IT'S HARDER TO ROOT AND CHANGE ROMS, AND BECAUSE OF THE STUPID CID RESTRICTION, FIRMWARE LEAKS ARE NEXT TO USELESS FOR MOST CUSTOMERS. HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE S-OFF IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
      
      2. GORILLA GLASS 2??: AFTER 18 MONTHS OF (AB)USE THE SCREEN ON MY S2 IS STILL PRISTINE. THE ONE X HAS 2 HUGE SCRATCHES IN ONLY 2 MONTHS. I HAVE NOT USED A SCREEN COVER WITH EITHER PHONE.
      
      
      SO-SO:
      
      1. THE SOUND - IT'S CLEAR, BUT NOT AT ALL LOUD. I DON'T LISTEN TO MUCH MUSIC ON THE PHONE, BUT BEATS AUDIO IS GOOD FROM WHAT I COULD MAKE OF IT. IN THE SOUND DEPARTMENT SONY'S XLOUD PHONES ARE THE BEST I HAVE HEARD.
      
      2. THE CONSTRUCTION - IT'S SLEEK AND ALL THAT, BUT IT'S ALSO VERY SLIPPERY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY BAD CONSIDERING THE WEAKER(?) SCREEN. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE FIXED STORAGE AS WELL, ALTHOUGH THAT CAN PROBABLY BE FIXED BY USING THE USB HOST FEATURE AVAILABLE ON SOME CUSTOM KERNELS."
HTC One X E720,3,"DEFINATELY ONE OF THE BEST PHONES AVAILABLE. THE SCREEN IS AWESOME. IT MERGES PERFECTLY WITH IT'S ANDRIOD OS. THE HTC SENSE IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST THING IN THE MARKET. IT'S CAMERA COULD'NT BE ANY BETTER. PERFECION IS THE WORD FOR THE CAMERA. THE TOUCH IS FLAWLESS. IT'S RAM OF 1 GB IS LARGE, ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN SMATPHONES.
      
      
      HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO DO THINGS THAT REQUIRE A LOT OF POWER THEN YOU'LL FIND IT IS UNDERPOWERED. IT'S MASSIVE PROCESSOR OF 1.5 GHZ IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE PRICE. THE TOUCH HANGS IF YOU GO FAST. ROOTING EATS UP NEARLY ALL OF THE 1GB OF THE RAM. ONCE THAT HAPPENS YOU'LL FIND IT HANGING A LOT.
      
      
      ALLL IN ALL, IT'S A PREETY GOOD PHONE BUT HARDCORE USERS WILL FACE PROBLEMS."
HTC One X E720,3,"DO NOT BUY A QUAD CORE BECAUSE NONE OF THE PHONE BASED APPS REQUIRE SO MUCH OF POWER VERY FEW APPS OR YOU CAN SAY GAMES REQUIRE THAT MUCH POWER.
      
      MAY BE A LARGER SCREEN DEVICE MIGHT BE MUCH USEFUL THAN A QUAD CORE PHONE.."
HTC One X E720,3,"FOR 38K, ONLY 8 MP ISN'T ENOUGH......ALSO THE BATTERY IS NOT ENOUGH FOR QUAD CORE PROCESSORS,THEY SUCK THE JUICE OF THE BATTERY AND CANNOT OPEN BATTERY........MICRO SIM IS OTHER PROBLEM,CANNOT PUT SIM IN OTHER SIMPLE MOBILE AT EMERGENCY TIMES......ALSO THE CAMERA EYE BEHIND PANEL DOES NOT LOOK GOOD...............................................................................................BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS SMALL BATTERY....WAIT FOR S3"
HTC One X E720,3,"HTC ONE X+ IS CHEAPER THAN THIS PHONE!!!
      
      THE ONE X+ HAS BIGGER BATTERY (AT 2100MAH), DOUBLE THE STORAGE (AT 64GB), FASTER PROCESSOR (1.7GHZ QUAD CORE) AND IS PRICED CHEAPER THAN THE HTC ONE X (32GB). FLIPKART AND HTC MUST BE KIDDING. GET THE PRICING RIGHT FLIPKART AND HTC."
HTC One X E720,3,"I HAVE SEARCHED FOR ALL KINDS OF DETAILS ON THIS PRODUCT. IT LOOKS STUNNING! BUT, ITS NOT WORTH IT FOR THE PRICE THEY R OFFERING IT AT.. IT SHOULD HAV BEEN FOR 30K MAX. THE PROB WID THIS PHONE IS THE BATTERY LIFE, EVEN WITH THE TEGRA 3 PROCESSOR ITS VERY LESS LOOKIN AT THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN PLUS ITS HD..
      
      NOW COMING AT PROCESSOR THEY SAY ITS VERY FAST COZ ITS QUAD CORE, ACTUALLY (4+1) CORES.. YET ITS SLOWER THAN S4 SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR WHICH IS INSTALLED IN HTC ONE XL (AMERICAN VERSION).
      
      I FEEL ITS BETTER TO WAIT FOR THE BEAST-- SAMSUNG GALAXY S-III.
      
      COZ EVEN THAT WIL COME AT SIMILAR PRICE IF NOT LESS.. ;)
      
      
      PROS:
      
      # IMAGE CHIP IMPROVES IMAGE QUALITY GREATLY.
      
      
      # CORNING GORILLA GLASS PROTECTION FOR ITS HD SCREEN.

      #BIGGEST CON IS BATTERY LIFE
      
      
      # TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WT IT OFFERS.
      
      
      SO MY ADVICE IS WAIT TIL S-III RELEASES(MAY-JUNE). YA'LL WIL GET OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FRM, ALSO THE PRICE OF DIS BABY SHOULD COME DOWN BY DEN!"
HTC One X E720,3,"I USED TO HAVE A HTC SENSATION XE,BUT I SOLD IT AFTER USING 5 MONTHS.REASON WAS ONLY THE CAMERA QUALITY.VERY DISSATISFYING.USUALLY  AN 8MP CAMERA TAKES A PHOTO OVER 1.5MB TO 3MB.BUT MY PHONE HARDLY USE TO TAKE 1MB SIZE OF PICS,EVEN I HAVE CHECKED THE PHOTO SIZE ON FRIEND'S HTC SENSATION XE.RESULT WAS SAME.PICS WERE BAD N WAY BELOW EXPECTATIONS.PICS TAKEN FRON SONY XPERIA RAY IS BETTER THAN IT.
      
      NOW ABOUT ONE X,IT HAS THE SAME CAMERA.FOR ME QUAD CORE IS NOT SO MUCH REQUIRED,SINCE I M NOT A BIG GAMER.I M A HTC FAN FOR IT'S SENSE.I BOUGHT SENSATION XE ON 13/11/2011 FOR 31,900 FROM DELHI N SOLD IT ON 7/04/12 FOR 24K IN BANGALORE.
      
      BUT FOR NEXT I'LL BE WAITING FOR SONY XPERIA ION WITH 12MP CAMERA(WITH A DEDICATED CAMERA KEY) N 4.65"" SCREEN.IT'S A DUAL CORE PHONE WITH GREAT LOOKS,WHICH MATTERS MORE FOR ME.
      
      ONE THING MORE ABOUT ONE X,I DON'T LIKED THE BACK PANEL DESIGN OF THE PHONE.HTC SENSATION XE IS BEST DESIGNED PHONE FROM HTC TILL DATE.
      
      TILL THE SONY XPERIA ION GET RELEASED,SADLY I'HV TO USE SAMSUNG GURU35..MISSING ANDROID :("
HTC One X E720,3,"ONE X COSTS 14,000 RUPEES MORE THAN DESIRE X. IS IT REALLY WORTH FOURTEEN THOUSAND MORE.
      
      
      ADVANTAGES OF ONE X:
      
      
      1) QUADCORE PROCESSOR VS DUAL CORE FOR DESIRE X
      
      
      2) 1GB RAM FOR ONE X VS 786 MB RAM FOR DESIRE X
      
      
      3)1800 MH BATTERY VS 1650 MH BATTERY
      
      
      4) MORE SCREEN RESOLUTION
      
      
      I AM NOT MENTIONING SCREEN SIZE BECAUSE FOR SOME PEOPLE 4.7 IS PREFERABLE AND FOR SOME 4 INCH IS PREFERABLE.
      
      
      ADVANTAGES OF DESIRE X:
      
      
      1) ITS THINNER AND LIGHTER
      
      
      2) ITS MORE POCKETABLE.
      
      
      3) IT HAS EXPANDABLE MEMORY EVEN THOUGH IT HAS LESS INTERNAL MEMORY THAN ONE X.

      SO I WOULD SAY BETTER GO WITH XPRIA S WITH AMAZING CAMERA,
      
      SCREEN QUALITY AND BETTER BATTRY BACK UP BECAUSE OF DUAL CORE PROCESSOR WHICH CONSUME LESS BATTERY THAN QUAD CORE IN HTC ONE X..."
HTC One X E720,3,"THOUGH HTC HAS STARTED THIS NEW QUARTER WITH ONE SERIES AND FOCUSED  ON CREAM CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO RECOVER THE LOSS OF PREVIOUS YEAR, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO GIVE ATTENTION AT SOME SMALL THINGS WHICH A GADGET LOVER MIGHT THINK WHILE BUYING THIS MONSTER !!. BEATS AUDIO IS SOMETHING WHICH A MUSIC LOVER WILL DIE FOR IT BUT WHAT IS THE MEANING OF STOPPING BEATS AUDIO HEADSET (SELLING TEA WITHOUT SUGAR)? I SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHY DID THEY MADE COLOR ADJUSTMENT WITH THE CAMERA WHEN IT WAS SO POWERFUL AND NO SENSE IN MAKING A NON-REMOVABLE BATTERY? THIS IS THE REASON WHY SAMSUNG G I9300 HAS 9 MILLIONS PRE-ORDER BEFORE IT'S LAUNCH WHILE HTC WASN'T THAT KNOWN TO ALL THE WORLD."
HTC One X E720,3,"TO RUN ANDROID ICE CREAM SANDWICH ,I DONT KNOW WHY IT REQUIRES QUAD CORE PROCESSORS, EARLIER TO RUN  ANDROID GINGER BREAD THEY USED DUAL CORE PROCESSORS , AND I THINK FOR THE NEXT VERSION OF ANDROID IT REQUIRES 8 CORE PROCESSORS.
      
      ITS SIMPLY A HYPE...FOOLING PEOPLE,  BOASTING DUALCORE , QUADCORE ETC..
      
      THE WINDOWS PHONE AND IPHONE OS RUNS WITH A SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR SO SMOOTHLY WITH BETTER GUI (GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE) THAN ANDROID.AND APPS ARE SO GOOD IN WINDOWPHONE AND AS WELL AS IN IPHONE COMPARED TO ANDROID
      
      HIGHER THE CORES OF PROCESSORS WILL SIMPLY DRAIN THE BATTERY NOTHING ELSE IT WILL DO. YOU HAVE TO CARRY CHARGER WHERE EVER YOU GO.
      
      AGAIN THE CONCEPT OF MICROSIM ITS NOT THE HIGHLIGHT.
      
      HTC MAKES GOOD PHONES NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. BUT DONT GET CONFUSED FOR DUALCORE, QUADCORE MAYBE ANDROID OS REQUIRE SO MUCH..."
HTC One X E720,2,"AMONG ALL THIS CRIBBING ABOUT HTC SERVICE, PLEASE TRY TO SEE MY CASE. THERE IS A SERVICE CENTRE LISTED ON HTC INDIA SITE UNDER REDINGTON IN JALANDHAR. IT TOOK ME TWO HOURS TO FIND THAT UNKNOWN SHOP INSIDE A HOUSE WITHOUT ANY BANNER. ON REACHING THERE I SAW IT WAS CLOSED(14/06/12 1540 HRS) . THEN I KEPT GOING THERE EVERYDAY AT DIFFERNT TIMES BETWEEN 11 TO 5 FOR NEXT FIVE DAYS.THEN ON MONDAY I CALLED YOUR CALL CENTRE WHICH AFTER PUTTING ME ON HOLD FOR 20 MINUTES SAID THAT THE ADDRESS HAS CHANGED AND HE WILL PUT ME A MAIL REARDING NEW ADDRESS WITHIN AN HOUR. WHEN I DID NOT RECIEVE ANY MAIL I CALLED UP AGAIN AND THIS TIME I WAS PUT ON HOLD FOR 37 MINUTES, AFTER WAIT I RECIEVED A REPLY THAT THERE IS SOME PROBLEM WITH THAT CENTER AND THE MANAGER OF THAT CENTER WILL CALL ME ON TUESDAY. ITS THURSDAY TODAY AND NO CORRESPONDENCE YET."
HTC One X E720,2,"GOOD TRY BY HTC TO REVIVE THEIR BRAND...BUT IT FALLS SHORT..
      
      FIRST OF ALL,USP OF THIS IS....ICS OUT OF THE BOX AND QUAD CORE PROCESSOR.
      
      BUT THESE ARE THE POINTS TO BE NOTED
      
      
      1. ALMOST ALL FLAGSHIP PHONES(SONY AND SAMSUNG HIGHEND PHONES RELASED IN 2011) ARE GETTING ICS..SO PAYING ALMOST 40K FOR ICS ALONE IS RIDICULOUS.
      
      
      2. NO DOUBT TEGRA3 IS QUAD CORE AND IS VERY POWERFUL..BUT IT WAS A HURRIED PRODUCT BY NVIDIA TO BEAT THE COMPETITION(SIMILAR TO TEGRA 2 WHICH DIDN'T HAD SIMD)
      
      IN CONCLUSION....BUY IT IF YOU NEED IT DESPERATELY..OR HOLD ON TILL 3RD QUATER..YOU WILL HAVE MORE OPTIONS."
HTC One X E720,1,"1) QUAD CORE PHONE SURVIVE ON A SILLY BATTERY LIKE THIS ONES'S
      
      2) GET AN UPGRADE TO FURTHER ANDROID VERSIONS WHEN WE HAVE HTC SENSE BUILT OER ICS
      
      3) PHONE BE PRICED AT 38000 AND EVER HOPE TO SELL NUMBERS"
HTC One X E720,1,"1.I GOT EARPHONES PROBLEM--REPLACED IN 1 MONTH
      
      2.NOW DISPLAY GONE-- ASKING 20 DAYS TO REPAIR
      
      
      WITH 4 MONTHS ONLY GOT 2 MAJOR PROBLEM...WORSE SERVICE DONT DONT GO FOR HTC..HTC IS CHEATING THE IDIANS...................."
HTC One X E720,1,"AFTER YEARS OF BEING A NOKIA N82 USER, BOUGHT A HTC ONE X. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. HAS VERY POOR RECEPTION OF MOBILE SIGNAL. TRIED WITH OTHER SIM CARDS BUT PROBLEM PERSISTS. REAL PAIN IN THE NECK. THE BATTERY LIFE IS PATHETIC. GETS VERY HOT. WORSE, THEIR SITE SAYS THAT IN BANGALORE THE SERVICE CENTER IS ON INFANTRY ROAD WITH REDDINGTON. WENT THERE TO FIND THAT THEY DO NOT SERVICE IT ANY MORE. IT HAS MOVED TO RAJAJINGAR. NO ONE KNOWS THE NUMBER! NOW I AM STUCK, CAN'T USE THE MICROSIM ON MY OLD PHONE. THIS IS THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF A MOBILE. IT FAILS MISERABLY. WHATS THE POINT OF HAVING ALL THE TECH. NEVER EVER BUY OR RECOMMEND A HTC PHONE. ITS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT. SELLING IT OFF AND GETTING A SIII OR IPHONE 4S."
HTC One X E720,1,DOWNLOAD 'SUPER VIDEO' APP AND THEN SEE THE MAGIC OF ONE X.I HAVE ALREADY REPLACED TWO 'ONE X' DUE 2 THIS MAGIC.PLEASE TRY THIS GUYS............................................................................................
HTC One X E720,1,"FIRSTLY I ROOTED THE PHONE AND THIS REALLY UPSET THE PHONE. LOTS OF HANGING ISSUES AND PHONE RESPONSE ISSUES. THOUGH IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY, HTC REPLACED THE BOARD AT A WHOPPING 17K. THEN I SETTLED FOR AS IS CONDITION WITHOUT ROOTING ETC AND MISSED THE FUN I CARRIED THROUGH WITH MY OLD SAMSUNG S2.
      
      
      THEN I REALISED THE IN CALL VOLUME QUALITY WAS POOR. I CHECKED THE NET AND I FOUND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD THESE ISSUES. THIS WAS A REAL PAIN FOR A BASIC PHONE.
      
      
      10 DAYS BACK THE PHONE FELL DOWN AND THE SIM CARD REGISTRATION WAS NOT EFFECTIVE. THIS HAS COME BACK NOW BUT AGAIN ALL DATA GONE AND RESETTING. THIS IS REALLY MAKING THINGS MISERABLE.
      
      
      BUT HUMAN MIND IS UN PREDICTABLE. I AM SERIOUSLY LOOKING TO UPGRADE TO HTC ONE. ANY USER WHO HAS MOVED FROM ONE X TO ONE??? WOULD LOVE TO HEAR."
HTC One X E720,1,"I HAD PURCHASED THIS PHONE IN THE END OF JULY THIS YEAR. SPEAKER SOUND IS NOT UP TO THE MARK.
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY LOW. MAIN THING IS THAT THERE IS NO ONE IN THE COMPANY WHO CARES FOR YOU  BECAUSE 2 TIMES MY PHONE WAS REPAIRED ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY BUT THE PROBLEM IS STILL SAME. NOW AGAIN COMPANY IS SAYING THAT DEPOSIT YOUR PHONE IN SERVICE STATION FOR ANOTHER 15 DAYS."
HTC One X E720,1,"I MUST WARN YOU BEFORE BUYING ANY HTC PHONE! THE KIND OF SERVICE I HAVE RECEIVED IS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING CONSIDERING IT IS SUCH A BIG BRAND!
      
      
      IN THE PAST 1 YEAR THAT I HAVE OWNED MY HTC DESIRE Z, I HAVE HAD TO GIVE IT FOR SERVICING 2 TIMES. FIRST TIME THEY TOOK A MONTH TO REPAIR AND THE SECOND TIME IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN 2 MONTHS AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PHONE!
      
      
      THEIR NETWORK IS SO BAD THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE PHONE. THEY HAVE OUTSOURCED THEIR FRONT-END SERVICE TO THE MOST USELESS PEOPLE WHO NEVER COOPERATE. THE CUSTOMER CARE IS JUST SOME CALL CENTER WHO SWEET-TALK YOU INTO BELIEVING YOU WILL GET THE PHONE WHILE THE ACTUAL SERVICE CENTER IS SOMEWHERE IN BANGALORE AND EVERYONE BLUNTLY REFUSES TO PROVIDE THE CONTACT NUMBER FOR THAT!!
      
      
      I HAVE WASTED SO MUCH TIME &AMP; MONEY ON MAKING CALLS TRYING TO FOLLOW UP AND I HAVE EVEN HAD TO GO TILL THEIR HIGHER MANAGEMENT BUT ITS OF NO USE...
      
      
      IF YOU ARE BUYING HTC, THEN YOU'RE JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE."
HTC One X E720,1,"I THINK HTC HAS GOEN MAD
      
      WHEN ONE X+ IS AVAILABLE FOR 29K WITH 64 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND 8MP PRIMARY CAMERA AND 1.3 FRONT CAMERA THEN WHY SOME ONE WILL BUY ONE X FOR 33K.............................................................HTC ONE X+ IS UPGRADED VERSON OF ONE X.."
HTC One X E720,1,"I WONDER WHY PEOPLE STILL PURCHASING THIS PHONE? AN UPDATED MODEL OF ONE X I.E. ONE X PLUS WITH 64 GB INBUILT MEMORY ,1.7 QUAD CORE GORILLA GLASS 2 IS AVAILABLE AT RS 29990 ONLY. I AM ALREADY USING 0NE X PLUS AND IT IS AWESOME."
HTC One X E720,1,IS THE BATTERY OF HTC ONE X REMOVABLE.. IF NOT THEN WHATS THE POINT OF GIVING A 2200 MAH BATTERY WITH THIS PHONE???
HTC One X E720,1,"ITS NOT EVEN BEEN A MONTH WHEN THE HTC ONE X MET ITS FATE AS IT FELL FROM MY HAND ACCIDENTLY WHILE SLIPPING OUT FROM MY JEANS POCKET. THE LCD WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED INSPITE OF THE SILICON CASE, AND THEY CALL THIS GORILLA GLASS! I WAS AMAZED AND SHOCKED TOO. WENT TO THE SERVICE CENTER IN NUNGAMBAKKAM, CHENNAI AND THEY SAY THEY DON'T HAVE STOCK OF SPARES (THEY HAD A COUPLE MORE OF HTC ONE X WIT BROKEN LCD, AWAITING REPAIR) ITS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK NOW AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT GOT THE SPARES, INSPITE OF CHARGING RS. 7800 FOR THE LCD REPLACEMENT.
      
      ITS NOT SURPRISING WHY SAMSUNG OUTSELLS EVERY HTC PRODUCT. SOON ENOUGH HTC WILL HAVE TO SHUT SHOP MUCH LIKE MOTOROLA AND DELL. I HAVE OWNED SAMSUNG GALAXY S FOR 2 YEARS AND NOT EVEN VISITED THE SAMSUNG SERVICE EVEN ONCE. IT WAS MY COMPLETE BLUNDER THAT I OPTED FOR HTC ONE X INSTEAD OF SGSIII."
HTC One X E720,1,"JUST PUT SOME WATER ON THIS PHONE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
      
      DON'T TALK ABOUT THE BUILD QUALITY
      
      
      NOW THROW AN S3 INTO AN FISH POT ( CLEAN WATER )
      
      AND SEE WHAT'S DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAMSUNG AND HTC
      
      
      AND YEAH YOU'D BE THINKING LIKE WHY WE WOULD THROW AN PHONE INTO WATER...
      
      BUT YEAH SOMETIMES YOU MAY DROP IT
      
      JUST YOU GOTTA HAVE AN STRONG BEAST
      
      AM NEVER EVER GONNA BUY AN HTC PRODUCT AGAIN
      
      AND AFTER GETTING THESE BOTH PHONES AFTER AN YEAR USE OF GALAXY S2
      
      THE SCREEN OF ONEX SEEMS SO DULL EVEN THAN GS2
      
      AND YOU'D NEVER KNOW WHO STRONGLY THE INNER MATERIAL WILL BE BUILT IN SAMSUNG"
HTC One X E720,1,"NOT A GOOD PHONE.SUPPORT ONLY MICRO SIM(GOT A MICRO SIM AFTER 1MONTH AND WITH A LOT OF FIGHTING FROM MY SERVICE PROVIDER(AIRTEL KOLKATA)) .APART FROM THAT PHOTO QUALITY IN LOW LIGHT IS NOT GOOD.OVERALL PICTURE ISNT AS GOOD AS WE CAN EXPECT FROM A 8MP CAMERA.
      
      
      PHONE IS REALLY SUPER FAST...BUT WITH THAT KIND A PRICE TAG (WITHOUT BEAT HEADPHONE!!!!) FEELING MYSELF CHEATED.1ST TIME HTC DISAPPOINT ME."
HTC One X E720,1,"ONE FINE MORNING THE ONE X WAKES UP N SAYS 'OK LET ME TRY TO RULE THE MARKET'S. AS HE GOES TO RULE THE MARKET HE GETS INTO A FIGHT WITH THE S3.THE S3 AT THE END SLAUGHTERS HIM.
      
      
      REFERRING TO THIS STORY PEOPLE WOULD THINK I'M DUMB OR STUPID OR HAVE JUST GOT UP FROM SLEEPING IN A GUTTER.BUT YOU PEOPLE ARE WRONG.IM NOT SAYING ITS TERRIBLE OR A WASTE OF MONEY N TIME.BUT I THINK THE S3 IS BETTER.1K MORE EXPENSIVE THE S3 HAS A WORSE QUAD PROCESSOR (1.4 GHZ) COMPARED TO THE ONE X(1.5 GHZ) AND THE ONE X HAS A BETTER CAMERA... BUT, THE S3 HAS THE TRUE FEEL OF BEING A SMARTPHONE.SEE THE S3, HMM YOU'LL SAY ITS USELESS I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THE ONE X.BUT HOLD THE S3 YOU'LL SAY THE S3IS BETTER THAN THE ONE X...BUT USE THE FEATURES OF THE S3 AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT SAMSUNG HAVE TRIED TO TELL US WITH THIS PHONE.YOU CAN ALWAYS INCREASE YOUR SPACE IN YOUR S3 FROM 16 GB TO 64GB!!! BUT IN THE ONE X YOU HAVE TO STICK WITH 34 GB WHICH IS A DISADVANTAGE TO THE ONE X.BOTH ARE MADE UP OF PLASTIC SO THAT WE CAN'T COMPARE.I HAVE BOTH THE MARKETING GIANTS(S3 N ONE X).I SERIOUSLY DINT LIKE THE ONE X.YOU DONT HAVE THE FEEL YOU KNOW. I CANT EXPRESS IT IN WORDS.IF U HAVE THE ONE X SELL IT AND GET THE S3.IT SUCKZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
HTC One X E720,1,"ONE OF MY FRIEND BOUGHT ONE OF THESE PHONES...
      
      ITS PACKED WITH A LOT OF FEATURES BUT SINCE THE MOST VITAL FEATURE IS THE BATTERY BACKUP WHICH STANDS ONLY FOR HALF A DAY WITHOUT GAMEPLAY... IS REALLY BAD....
      
      
      I WOULD RATHER PAY A COUPLE OF BUCKS MORE AND BUY AN IPHONE 4S!!!"
HTC One X E720,1,"PLEASE DONT BUY THIS MOBILE
      
      DRAWBACKS
      
      1.BATTERY IS UNREMOVABLE,IF EVER IT GETS DAMAGED AFTER 2 YEARS OR OVERHEATED WHICH IS RARE BUT THERE IS A CHANCE BATTERY CAN BE DAMAGED THAN U CANT DO ANYTHING EXCEPT BUYING IT AGAIN .
      
      2.BATTERY IS 1800 MAH ONLY WHICH IS VERY VERY LESS FOR A QUAD CORE PHONE ,IT SHOULD BE ATLEASE 2500 MAH.
      
      3.NO MEMORY CARD SLOT.TRANFERING DATA FROM ONE PHONE TO OTHER NEEDS MEMORY CARD FOR FAST COPYING N EXCHANGING
      
      4.TO COSTLE 38000 RS NO WAY IT SHOULD BE 30000 ONLY
      
      
      WAIT FOR SAMSUNG GALAXT S3 OR OTHER QUAD CORE PHONES WHICH WILL BE LAUNCHED SOON
      
      
      HTC ONE X NOT WORTH TO BUY ,IF STILL U WANNA BUY IT U R WASTING UR MONEY ,"
HTC One X E720,1,"PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE,
      
      AFTER PAYING 36K, I AM REGRETTING .
      
      HAVE GONE TO SERVICE CENTER TWICE SINCE JULY WHEN I GOT THE PHONE.
      
      THE FEATURES ARE ACTUALLY GOOD, BUT YOU WOULD LIKE IT WHEN IT WORKS AS A PHONE ALSO.
      
      
      BASICALLY ITS VERY SMART, BUT NOT A PHONE"
HTC One X E720,1,"THE PRICE OF HTC S728E ONE X+ WITH ALL THE FOLLOWING FEATURES IS RS. 30600
      
      * LARGER BATTERY (2100 MAH COMPARED TO 1800)
      
      * BETTER SECONDARY CAMERA (1.6 COMPARED TO 1.3 MP)
      
      * FASTER PROCESSOR (1.7 COMPARED TO 1.5 GHZ)
      
      * MORE STORAGE (64 GB COMPARED TO 32 GB)
      
      
      BUT THE PRICE OF HTC ONE X S720E STILL REMAINS THE SAME AT RS. 34999.
      
      
      I THINK NOONE DIDNT NOTICE THAT ""HTC ONE X+"" IS A REVISION ON ""HTC ONE X"" AND IS BETTER IN ALL WAYS."
HTC One X E720,1,"UNFORTUNATE BAD EXPERIENCE WITH HTC ONE X!
      
      -----------------------------
      
      BAD THINGS FIRST...
      
      IS IT WORTH 30K PLUS? DEFINITELY NOT!!!
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE LAST WEEK, THE SAME DAY THE PROXIMITY SENSOR STOPPED WORKING- WHICH MEANS WHEN YOU ON A PHONE CALL THE SCREEN GOES TOTAL BLANK- YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE SEE SECOND CALL, SWITCH LOUD SPEAKER, YOU CAN'T USE NUMBER PAD (E.G. CHOOSE AN OPTION DURING AN AIR TEL 121 CALL, ETC.)
      
      
      AFTER PLAYING WITH THE PHONE FOR 15MIN, I GOT CALL AND IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING - THE SCREEN WAS WARM (I WOULD SAY BIT HOT) IT WAS VERY ANNOYING, WHEN I KEEP THE VOLUME LITTLE LESS THAN MAX I COULD FEEL A LITTLE VIBRATION IN BACK CASE BEHIND THE SPEAKERS.
      
      
      I LOVED THE TOUCH DURING DEMO. BUT AFTER TWO DAYS OF USAGE I WOULD RATE IT AVERAGE (DEFINITELY BETTER THAN OTHER SMARTPHONES THOUGH)
      
      
      DEFINITELY THERE IS LITTLE MORE THAN AVERAGE HEAT BOTH IN THE BACK CASE AND FRONT SCREEN. IN SMART PHONES YOU SHOULD EXPECT SOME AMOUNT OF WARM/HEAT, BUT ONE X IT WAS WAY ABOVE WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON A 35K PHONE.
      
      
      3RD DAY WITH MY NEW PHONE- I WENT TO A SERVICE CENTER RECOMMENDED BY HTC TOLL FREE HELP-LINE. SURPRISE, THERE IS NO SUCH SERVICE CENTER. HTC WEBSITE IS NOT UPDATED AND HELP-LINE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY SERVICE. THE SERVICE CENTER IS PATHETIC. IT WAS LIKE A HOSPITAL QUEUE! AFTER SPENDING 35K I HAVE TO WAIT IN QUEUE FOR FEW HOURS BEFORE I GET A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM.
      
      
      EMAIL LAYOUT IS GOOD BUT WHEN U ACTUALLY OPEN AN EMAIL IT KIND OF SUCKS....E.G. IT WON?T SHOW A TABLE IN THE BODY OF THE MESSAGE, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T CROP A MESSAGE TO FIT THE SCREEN
      
      
      TURN ON MAPS AND THE BATTERY DRAINS SUPER-FAST... 5MIN ON MAPS AND I LOT APPROX. 8% OF MY BATTERY!
      
      
      ----------------------------
      
      GOOD STUFF ABOUT HTC ONE X......
      
      
      HTC SENSE UI IS JUST BRILLIANT. I LOVED IT.
      
      THE INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE, FACE BOOK AND OTHER SOCIAL NETWORK IS AMAZING. GO TO CONTACTS AND YOU GET EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR BUDDIES- THEIR LAST FB UPDATE, BIRTHDATE, PHOTOS, ETC.
      
      
      THE SCREEN IS AMAZING- SHARP AND PERFECT FOR WATCHING MOVIES AND PHOTOS
      
      
      LOOKS BIT STYLISH AND NEAT.
      
      
      CAMERA- NO COMPARISON?  TOO GOOD
      
      
      MUSIC- SHARP AND ENJOYABLE ... VERY GOOD
      
      
      INTERNET SURFING IS SUPER-FAST (ONLY IF YOUR NETWORK/WI-FI IS FAST)
      
      
      -------
      
      SUMMARY:
      
      
      HTC ONE X IS NOT FOR AN EMAIL PERSON, FOR SOMEONE SPENDING 3-4 HRS/DAY ON PHONE, FREQUENT TRAVELER. ASK YOURSELF IF YOU NEED A BRILLIANT CAMERA AND A GOOD MUSIC/VIDEO EXPERIENCE?  OR SMART PHONE?
      
      HTC ONE X - 35K IS JUST FOR A BRILLIANT CAMERA, MUSIC PLAYER AND LARGE SCREEN VIDEO WATCHING. (I WOULD RATHER BUY A TABLET AND A GOOD CAMERA!!! OR A 32 INCH TV!!! )
      
      
      I WAS BIT CONCERNED WHEN I SAW FEW MORE PEOPLE (AT LEAST 4) WITH ONE X IN THE SERVICE CENTER (ALL LESS THAN 5 MONTHS OLD). I PERSONALLY HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE (PHONE AND SERVICE). MAY BE ITS JUST ME!!!
      
      
      I GOT A DOA FROM SERVICE CENTER AND REPLACED MY PHONE. I AM NOT USING HTC ANYMORE.
      
      
      I USE SMART PHONES FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS AND I AM BUSINESS KIND OF USER.
      
      IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIME SMART PHONE BUYER AND NOT A BUSINESS KIND OF USER THEN IGNORE MY REVIEW. YOU ARE JUST GOING TO LOVE THIS PHONE."
HTC One X E720,1,"WHY IS THE HTC ONE X PRICED HIGHER THAN THE ONE X PLUS.
      
      
      THE PLUS HAS EVERYTHING BETTER NAMELY-
      
      JELLY BEAN, 1.7GH QUAD CORE, 64 GB INTERNAL, 2100 MHA BATTERY AND REST IS ALL SAME.
      
      
      WHY WOULD ANYBODY PAY 5000/- MORE FOR A LESSER PHONE.
      
      
      THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED SINCE THE PLUS IS HERE. MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING CONNED INTO BUYING THE ONE X THINKING THEY ARE BUYING THE ONE X PLUS.

I BOUGHT T ON THE 28TH OF FEB AND SOLD IT 2 DAYS LATER &AMP; PLACED AN ORDER FOR A GOLDEN IPHONE 5S ON FLIPKART.  I RECEIVED IT BEFORE 48 HOURS EVEN WHEN THE ORDER WAS PLACED ON SATURDAY. I GUESS SUNDAYS ARE NOT OFF WITH FLIPKART.  ANYWAY, I RECTIFIED MY MISTAKE AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ALL, THAT IF YOU HAVE BEEN USING AN IPHONE, EITHER DON'T CHANGE IT OR CHANGE IT ONLY FOR A BETTER IPHONE.  THERE'S NO PHONE LIKE AN IPHONE.  ALSO, KEEP AN EYE ON THE IPHONE 5S PRICES ON FLIPKART, I BOUGHT IT FOR 49,494/-, TODAY IT'S FOR 47,900, DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY IT WAS 52,000/-.  SO IT'S LIKE A STOCK MARKET, KEEP AN EYE ON THE PRICE AND YOU'LL SAVE A THOUSAND RUPEES OR MAYBE 2.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME, JUST BUY IT MAN.  ALSO, I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE DETAILED BILL, THE PACKING, THE SHIPPING TIME AND THE FACT THAT THE PHONE WAS UNDER WARRANTY. I WAS ONLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE WARRANTY PART, I CHECKED ON THE WEBSITE, IT WAS GOOD ONE YEAR.  DON'T BE FOOLED BY SHOPKEEPERS, THEY'LL DISCOURAGE YOU TO BUY SUCH AN EXPENSIVE PHONE ONLINE, BUT DON'T WORRY, ALL'S GOOD. TAKE MY WORD.  IT'S ALL TAX PAID AND WITH BILL AND ALL ACCESSORIES.

      THIS IS REALLY A STUNNING PIECE OF CREATION &AMP; I WAS AMAZED BY THE KIND OF DISCOUNTS OFFERED BY FLIPKART &AMP; WS RETAIL FOR SUCH A FLAGSHIP PRODUCT FROM APPLE.
      
      
      THE PRODUCT WAS SAFELY DELIVERED AS ""MANUFACTURER BOX PACKED IPHONE"" DOUBLE PACKED INSIDE FLIPKART'S OWN BOX ALONG WITH CREDIT CARD SWIPING FACILITY WHILE TAKING THE DELIVERY AT MY DOORSTEP (COD).
      
      
      AS INDICATED BY THEIR WEBSITE, THE PRODUCT WAS 100% NEW &AMP; GENUINE &AMP;  APPLE INDIA'S DOMESTIC SERVICE WARRANTY (1YEAR) HAS STARTED AS SOON AS I ACTIVATED MY PHONE. SINCE APPLE PRODUCTS NEED ACTIVATION USING A SIM, YOU CAN MAKE OUT THE STATUS BY CHECKING THE ACTIVATION STATUS OF ITS IMEI WITH APPLE WEBSITE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER FLIPKART PREPARES THE INVOICE.
      
      
      THE NEW ICLOUD STORAGE OF 5GB (FREE WITH IPHONE) HELPED ME TO SEAMLESSLY TRANSFER ALL MY CONTACTS FROM MY OLD ANDROID PHONE TO THE NEW IPHONE.

MY SON COMPLAINS THAT THEY KICKED HIM OUT OF THE SCHOOL BECAUSE I DIDN'T PAY HIS TUITION FEE BUT I STICK MY PHONE ON HIS FACE AND ASK HIM TO DOWNLOAD SOME EDUCATION APPS AND STOP WHINING.. MOST OF THE TIME MY FAMILY WHINES THERE'S NO FOOD IN THE HOME.. THAT'S WHERE THE IPHONE SUPERIOR EARPHONES COMES TO USE.. IT COMPLETELY BLOCKS SURROUNDING NOISE.. I COULDN'T EVEN HEAR MY WIFE SCREAM HER LUNGS OUT.. THIS IS A DEFINITELY WORTHY PHONE.. I RECOMMEND THIS"
IPhone 5S,5,IDIOTS WHO HATE THIS PHONE UNDERSTAND THAT THE IPHONE IS THE BEST PHONE. GRAND CAN BE 5 INCHES AND FOR THOSE WHO USE IT I WISH THEM GOOD LUCK TO HANDLE THE PHONE IN ONE HAND. THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THIS DEVICE IS GREAT. THE OS IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT AND IT HAS MANY MORE FEATURES. PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT HAS A WASTE CAMERA JUST BECAUSE IT'S 8MP. APPLE DOES NOT INCREASE THE NO OF PIXELS IT INCREASES THE SENSOR SIZE THUS MAKING PICTURES EVEN BETTER WIT BETTER DETAIL. FLIPKART DON'T STOP SELLING THIS PHONE. THIS PHONE HAS A GREAT PROCESSOR AND OTHER SPECS SO THOSE WHO THINK THIS PHONE CAN'T PLAY HIGH END GAMES ARE WRONG. IPHONE CAN PLAY GAMES AT GREAT RESOLUTION AND QUALITY AND SPEED SO DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE PHONE. THE PHONE IS SIMPLE TO USE SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.

      ANYWAYS COMING TO IPHONE 5S .. ITS VERY SMOOTH , EVERY APP BUILD WITH QUALITY NO DOUBT APP STORE IS FILTERED AND IT IS ALSO HAVING GOOD QUALITY APPS ONLY NOT LIKE ANDROID

IPhone 5S,5,ITS AN APPLE PRODUCT... NEED WE SAY MORE !!! SLIGHTLY OVERPRICED BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE PREMIUM YOU PAY FOR A TOP NOTCH PRODUCT COUPLED WITH FANTASTIC APPLE SUPPORT.... THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY FLIPKART IN THE DELIVERY TIME &AMP; SECURE PACKAGING ALSO NEEDS MENTION... FLIPKART DELIVERED IT WITHIN 48 HOURS...
IPhone 5S,5,"IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE IPHONE 5S ISN'T AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE IPHONE 5 WHEN IT COMES TO BUILD QUALITY, BECAUSE ITS PREDECESSOR WAS SO WELL MADE. IN FACT, IT'S HARD TO SEE WHERE APPLE COULD IMPROVE. IN OUR OPINION, THE IPHONE 5S IS STILL THE BEST LOOKING SMARTPHONE OUT THERE. ITS PRECISION CUT ALUMINUM REAR SITS ABSOLUTELY FLUSH WITH GLASS PANELS THAT SIT AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM. ITS NEAT BEVELED EDGES ARE PERFECTLY FORMED AND THE 7.3MM THICK PHONE FEELS INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE IN THE HAND. WEIGHING JUST 112G, WHICH STILL FEELS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLY LIGHT WHEN YOU PICK UP THE SMARTPHONE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE IPHONE 5S IS STILL INCREDIBLE TO LOOK AT AND HOLD

      I AM A VERY HAPPY AND SATISFIED CUSTOMER"
IPhone 5S,5,"ITS ONE FLAWLESS GADGET THAT APPLE HAS PUT OUT... APPLE SPECIFICATIONS ARE UNDER STANDARD CONDITIONS.. I WENT THROUGH VARIOUS FORUMS AND FOUND REVIEWS ON IPHONE 5S. BATTERY BACK UP WAS AVERAGE 5 HOURS AND 30 MINUTES PLUS. WELL IT GIVES EXACTLY THE SAME FOR ME, I.E., ON CONTINUOUS USAGE WITH VODAFONE 3G, IT LASTS 5HOURS PLUS... OVERALL ITS A WONDERFUL PERFORMER IF YOUR USAGE IS AVERAGE.. I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR BUSINESS USE. THE BATTERY APP WOULD HELP GET MAXIMUM OUT OF THIS DEVICE..."
IPhone 5S,5,"I'VE BEEN USING AN IPHONE FOR 7 YEARS NOW AND ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT FAN OF APPLE'S FLAGSHIP PRODUCT SINCE 2007. I DON'T FIND MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IPHONE 5 VS IPHONE 5S, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CAMERA AND HARDWARE ON THE 5S AND YOU WOULD EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU ARE A HEAVY GAMER. THE SLO-MO FEATURE ON IPHONE 5S HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE SO FAR AND THE TOUCH TO PURCHASE/UNLOCK IS GREAT ADD-ON THOUGH AT TIMES IT DOESN'T RECOGNISE YOUR FINGER IF THEY ARE WET OR NOT KEPT AT RIGHT ANGLE."
IPhone 5S,5,"LET ME SIMPLIFY IT FOR YOU FOLKS

IPhone 5S,5,NO WORDS TO EXPLAIN THE FINENESS OF THE PHONE. APPLE HAS REALLY DONE ITS JOB EXTREMELY WELL. TOUCH ID IS TOTALLY AWESOME AND FULLY USEABLE. TOTALLY WORTH SPENDING 48-49K ON THUS PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY DADDY OF ALL SMARTPHONES

IPhone 5S,5,"SIMPLE YET POWERFUL.. AWESOME LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY.. SMOOTH &AMP; FASTEST FUNCTIONALITY.
      
      FLIPKART DELIVERED PRODUCT ON TIME AND PACKED NICELY."
IPhone 5S,5,"SIMPLE, FAST, AWESOME TOUCH, RELIABLE, NICE METALLIC FINISH, VERY GOOD OS :)
      
      TASKS ARE EXECUTED FAST. LAUNCHING APPS, PAGES LOADING, SWITCHING THROUGH MENUS, IT DOES IT IN A BREEZE. IOS RUNS SMOOTHLY BECAUSE IT'S CODED IN C, WHILE ANDROID IS CODED IN JAVA, WHICH HAS A LOT OF INEFFICIENCIES.
      
      I HAVE AN IPAD AND IMAC. IF I PLAY A GAME OF VICE CITY ON MY IPAD, I CAN CONTINUE ON THE SAME SAVE ON MY IPHONE WHEN I LEAVE MY HOUSE.
      
      IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH MY PHONE I CAN GO TO MY LOCAL APPLE STORE, AND THEY WILL EITHER FIX IT, OR REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE THERE ON THE SPOT. WITH OTHER MANUFACTURERS, THEY EITHER CONTRACT THEIR REPAIRS TO A 3RD PARTY, OR THEY REQUIRE YOU TO GO THROUGH THE RMA PROCESS, SHIP THE PHONE TO THEM, WHICH CAN TAKE WEEKS.
      
      DRAWBACKS:
      
      DESIGN COULD BENEFIT FROM A REFRESH
      
      CAMERA NOT EQUAL TO SOME OF THE OTHER TOP PHONES
      
      IN ALL THIS PHONE IS WHAT IS BEST FOR ME, BUT NOT EVERYONE OF COURSE."

IPhone 5S,5,"THIS IS NOT SO MUCH AS A REVIEW OF IPHONE 5S I BOUGHT BUT ALSO THAT FLIP KART DOES WHAT IT SAYS. GENUINE DEALS. THOUGH EBAY INDIA TIMES SHOPPING CAN BE CHEAPER OPTIONS  FLIPKART IS OUT RIGHTLY GENUINE. IF I WANT ONLY RELIABILITY AND PRICY ITEM I M GONNA LOOK FORWARD TO THIS.
      
      
      AS AFAR AS PRODUCT. IT'S THE BEST MOBILE IN MARKET."
IPhone 5S,5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I BOUGHT... THE PHONE'S IS AWESOME WITH FINGERPRIINT LOCK... NONE OF OF BROTHER SISTER CAN TOUCH MY PHONE NOW.... REALLY GREAT... I BECAME AN IPHONE FAN AGAIN AFTER BUYING THIS.... :) :) :)
IPhone 5S,5,"THOUGH I HAVE NOT PURCHASED MY IPHONE 5S FROM FLIPKART, AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL REVIEWS, I THOUGHT OF SHARING MY EXPERIENCE WITH ALL:
      
      THE IPHONE 5S IS ONE OF THE BEST LAUNCHES OFFERED BY APPLE INC. FOR ITS CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE GLOBE. THE PHONE HAS SOME CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGIES YET THE ELEGANCE SEPARATES IT FROM OTHER PRODUCTS.
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY IS THE BEST AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET WITH ALUMINIUM AND GLASS CREATING A MASTERPIECE YOU WOULD LOVE TO HOLD IN YOUR HAND. THE PHONE FEATURES A TOUCH ID TOO WHICH ALLOWS USERS TO UNLOCK THE DEVICE USING THEIR FINGERPRINTS, SOMETHING I ENJOY EVERY TIME I UNLOCK MY DEVICE.
      
      PHONE FEATURES A FIRST X64 BIT ARCHITECTURE IN HARDWARE OFFERING WHICH MAKES IT TRULY CLASSY. IT BOOSTS ITS PERFORMANCE SO MUCH THAT ONCE YOU USE IT, YOU FORGET ABOUT ANY OTHER DEVICE.
      
      THE NEW ISIGHT CAMERA PROVIDES SOME OF THE BEST MOMENTS YOU CAN CAPTURE WITH A DUAL TONE FLASH THAT GIVES YOU THE FINEST SKIN TONES UNDER LOW LIGHTS. ALSO, THE PHONE FEATURES A SLO-MO OPTION WHICH ALLOWS USERS TO CAPTURE VIDEO IN 120 FPS SO YOU CAN REALLY GO SLOW ON A MOTION.
      
      AND THEN IT COMES ALONG WITH IOS7, THE MOST ADVANCED AND INTELLI FIRMWARE EVER BUILT IN THE MOBILE INDUSTRY. ALSO, WHEN YOU BUY A NEW IPHONE, YOU GET APPS FOR FREE SUCH AS IMOVIE, IPHOTO, GARAGE BAND, PAGES, NUMBERS ETC. WHICH ARE SO USER FRIENDLY AND JUST HELPS YOU CREATE A MARVEL IN YOUR DEVICE EVERYDAY.
      
      HOWEVER, IOS7 FREEZES SOMETIME WHILE USING THIRD-PARTY APPS ON IPHONE 5S PERHAPS BECAUSE OF ARCHITECTURE DIFFERENCE BUT THAT WILL BE SORTED OUT TOO SOON IN UPCOMING RELEASES.
      
      HOLDING AND USING AN IPHONE IS AN ALL TOGETHER A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE, BUT IF ITS IPHONE 5S, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN THAT FOR SURE. THE PRECISION THAT IS DISPLAYED IN THE MANUFACTURING IN THIS DEVICE SETS ITS BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY OTHER MOBILE PHONE MANUFACTURER. SO, IF YOU WANT PERFORMANCE, AND YOU ARE READY TO SPEND SOME MONEY, THIS IS THE BEST CHOICE YOU CAN HAVE."
IPhone 5S,5,"TO EXPLORE SIRI AND VOICE CALLING ETC. WOULD NEED SOME TIME BUT IT IS BEST FOR
      
      
      FACETIME (LIVE CALLING)
      
      
      BEST IN UPLOADS ETC THAN OTHER PHONES"
IPhone 5S,5,"UNFORTUNATELY HE GOT A DEFECTIVE SET. THERE IS NO WAY WS RETAIL/ FLIPKART COULD HAVE KNOWN IT. NO ONE OPENS THE BOX AND TESTS THE PHONES BEFORE SHIPPING THEM TO CUSTOMERS.
      
      
      HOWEVER HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT FOR ANY ISSUE HE SIMPLY NEEDS TO WALK-IN TO ANY APPLE CUSTOMER-CARE CENTER.
      
      
      THE SUPPORT IS SIMPLY UNBELIEVABLE. IF THERE WAS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THE SET THEY WOULD SIMPLY REPLACE HIS PHONE FOR FREE WITHOUT ANY QUESTIONS ASKED. SUCH IS APPLE CUSTOMER CARE QUALITY. HOWEVER HE DID NOT KNOW THIS NOR WAS HE TOLD ABOUT IT.
      
      
      NO ONE EXCEPT THE APPLE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO SOLVE HIS ISSUE. AND IT IS WAY TOO EASY TO GET THESE ISSUES RESOLVE."
IPhone 5S,5,"VERY GOOD PHONE, HAVING VERY GOOD FEATURES AND TOUCH WAS AWESOME, FINGERPRINT TECHNOLOGY WAS THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE ERA, AND CAM WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR AND A GOOD PHONE FOR THE PRICE..
      
      
      APPLE ALWAYS APPLE..."
IPhone 5S,5,VERY SATISFIED FROM MY IPHONE 5S. I THINK THE ONLY PHONE WHICH IS OPTIMIZED FOR EVERYTHING. GO FOR IPHONE 5S IF YOU WANT COMPLETE SATISFACTION BECAUSE THE WORD 'COMPROMISE' IS NOT IN MY DICTIONARY.
IPhone 5S,5,WELL ACTUALLY NOT MUCH TO COMMENT ON THE PRODUCT. PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING DEFINITELY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUYING. IT HAS A GOOD BATTERY LIFE ON CONTINUOUS USE WITH 3G OR WIFI.
IPhone 5S,5,"WHAT A PRODUCT IT IS... I CAN ONLY SAY.. AM SPEECHLESS.. EVERYTHING REALLY PERFECT...
      
      
      YOU HAVE ONLY FIVE STAR OPTION, OTHER WISE I SAY UNLIMITED STARS ..ULLALLALALLALALALLA"
IPhone 5S,5,"WHAT TO SAY IT'S ALWAYS THE BEST ....
      
      
      CAMERA WAS EXCELLENT
      
      PRICE IS HIGH BUT YOU FEEL IT WORTH
      
      
      AND FLIPKART SERVICE ALSO TOO GOOD GOT PRODUCT WITHIN 2 DAYS"
IPhone 5S,5,"WHETHER YOU'RE TECH-SAVVY OR NOT, YOU'LL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE THIS ONCE AND YOU'RE SET. IT'S THAT EASY TO GET USED TO!
      
      
      THE BEST PHONE MONEY CAN BUY!
      
      SUPERB CAMERA, GREAT MUSIC CLARITY, GREAT MULTITASKING, SHARP SCREEN, GOOD BATTERY LIFE, THE BEST AND MOST SECURE APP AND ITUNES STORE IN THEW WORLD.
      
      
      IF YOU'RE WILLING TO USE THIS PHONE THE WAY ITS MEANT TO BE, YOU WON'T EVER NEED ANOTHER BRAND!"
IPhone 5S,5,YOU CAN'T STOP LOVING IT EVERYTIME YOU USE THE PHONE. IT HAS A DIFFERENT AURA ABOUT IT. IT SIMPLY DOESN'T SIEGES TO AMAGE YOU!!!!!!!
IPhone 5S,4,"ABSOLUTE WORTH TO BUY THIS PHONE. GREAT TOUCH. EASY TO ACCESS. WHITE COLOR LOOKS REALLY COOL.
      
      - IOS 7 ROCKS
      
      - PASSBOOK FEATURE IS REALLY HANDY.
      
      
      ONCE YOU GET ADDICTED TO THIS PHONE ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO SWITCH TO SOME OTHER PHONE THEN AFTER."
IPhone 5S,4,APPLE 5S IS GOOD LOOKING AND APPLE 5S HAVE FINGER PRINT SENSOR LOCK IS VERY USEFUL TO HANDLING SAFE DATA. AND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO REGISTER.  VERY CLEAN MEANS REGISTER. SO FINGER PRINT IS WASTE I THINK. APPLE 5 AND 5S SIMILIAR ONLY DIFFERNT FINGER PRINT AND FINGER PRINT IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY
IPhone 5S,4,"AS A SMARTPHONE, ANDROIDS IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE ARE BETTER SINCE THEY ARE MORE CUSTOMIZABLE AND OFFERS BETTER BATTERY LIFE. BUT AS A STYLE STATEMENT, IPHONE IS AT THE TOP. ITS BUILD QUALITY IS UNMATCHED AND HAS BETTER RESALE VALUE THAN ANDROIDS."
IPhone 5S,4,"BUILD QUALITY: UNMATCHED (THE CLOSEST COMPETITOR WOULD BE THE HTC ONE)
      
      
      DISPLAY: MANY PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THIS 4-INCH RETINA DISPLAY OFFERING IS JOKE WHEN COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER MANUFACTURERS OFFER THESE DAYS. BUT THIS IS NOT A PHABLET; IT'S COMPARATIVELY MUCH EASIER TO USE WITH ONE HAND AND THE COLOR TONE OF THE 5S IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE OVERLY SATURATED DISPLAYS ON THE GALAXY S4 AND GALAXY NOTE 3.
      
      
      PROCESSOR AND RAM: THE 5S HAS ONLY 1GB RAM AND A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR WHICH SEEMINGLY PALES IN COMPARISON TO WHAT OTHER FLAGSHIP PHONES HAVE TO OFFER. BUT IF YOU ARE A SERIOUS BUYER, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THESE SPECS BECAUSE THE IPHONE 5S IS ACTUALLY ""THE FASTEST PHONE EVER TESTED"" TILL DATE. THE REASON WHY THE IPHONE 5S BLOWS AWAY THE COMPETITION IS BECAUSE IT'S PROCESSOR IS MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PHONE AND IT UTILIZES AND SQUEEZES PROCESSING POWER IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY UNLIKE OTHER PHONES WHOSE PROCESSORS ARE GENERIC AND USED ACROSS VARIOUS MANUFACTURERS WITHOUT REALLY UTILIZING AVAILABLE POWER TO IT'S FULL EXTENT.
      
      
      CAMERA: THE 5S HAS A EXCELLENT CAMERA BUT IT IS NOT THE BEST IN THE MARKET.
      
      
      CALL QUALITY: NORMAL CALLS ARE JUST AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER PHONE. BUT NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE NEW FACETIME AUDIO HD CALLING FEATURE ACROSS IOS 7 USERS, THE CLARITY IS ALMOST TOO MUCH! YOU CAN EVEN HEAR A PERSON SWALLOW OR SMACK HIS/HER LIPS. LITTLE TOO INTIMATE IF YOU ASK ME :-)
      
      
      SPECIAL FEATURE: FINGERPRINT SCAN AND UNLOCK YOUR PHONE. PEOPLE MAY ARGUE OVER THE PROS AND CONS OF SUCH A FEATURE BUT I WOULD PERSONALLY PREFER SUCH A FEATURE WHICH I WILL CERTAINLY MAKE USE OF; INSTEAD OF AN ALMOST USELESS FANCY FEATURE WHICH I RARELY USE. (EG: TOUCH TO SHARE)
      
      
      
      PRICE: CONSIDERING THAT THE MANUFACTURING COST OF THE IPHONE 5S IS JUST ONE DOLLAR MORE THAN THAT OF THE IPHONE 5 WHOSE MANUFACTURING COST IS AROUND INR 13,000; I WOULD HAVE LIKED THE 5S TO BE PRICED AT 40,000. IT IS WITHOUT DOUBT EXPENSIVE!"
IPhone 5S,4,"FLIPKART PRICE WAS 2000 TO 2500 RUPEES CHEAPER THAN LOCAL MARKET PRICE. ORIGINAL PRODUCT. NO COMPLAINTS.
      
      ADVISE: PLEASE BUY AN INSURANCE PLAN FOR YOUR NEW IPHONE 5S FROM ANY LOCAL IPHONE DEALER. IT COSTS AROUND RS 1750 FOR ONE YEAR."
IPhone 5S,4,GOT THIS PRODUCT LAST WEEK. FIRST I WAS HAPPY WITH THE PACKAGE FROM FLIPKART. U GUYS ROCK. HTE HARDWARE IS QUITE GOOD.ITS DA BEST INFACT. BUT NOT DA BEST SFTWARE. I CN DO MUCH MORE WITH MY NOTE 3 S ITS BETTER FEATURE WISE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BRAND AND QUALITY ITS IPHONE.I GIV IT A 4 STAR COS OF THE SOFTWARE
IPhone 5S,4,"GREAT PHONE, USUAL GOOD SERVICE BY FLIPKART. GOT TIMELY DELIVERY. FINGER PRINT RECOGNITION IS JUST SO COOL. AWESOME PRODUCT . CAMERA IS BETTER THAN MOST STAND ALONE DIGICAMS...STILL TO GET MY 5000 CASHBACK THOUGH.."
IPhone 5S,4,"HI FLIPKART.
      
      
      I HAD A WHILE/SILVER IPHONE 5S BEFORE THIS WHICH I SOLD LAST MONTH AND GOT THIS SPACE GREY ONE AND INTEND TO KEEP THE SAME TILL IPHONE 6 IS BACK IN ALL AWE &AMP; GLORY. I ALWAYS LIKED HOW UNIFORM THE SCREEN LOOKED WHEN THE PHONE IS SWITCHED OFF AND LYING BESIDE ME WHEN I'M BUSY WITH SOME ACTUAL WORK, FAR FROM ANY DISTRACTION DUE TO CONTRASTING WHITE AND BLACK.
      
      
      THE ONE PIECE I RECEIVED HAD TWO ISSUES AND IT PROMPTED ME TO RETURN-
      
      
      1) TWO TINY BLACK SPOTS WERE VISIBLE AGAINST A WHITE BACKGROUND IN APPS LIKE ""NOTES""; POSSIBLY SOME DUST PARTICLES HAD FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE SCREEN
      
      2) THE PHONE'S ALUMINIUM FRAME WAS BENT, STARTING FROM THE (-) VOLUME BUTTON AND UPWARDS. IT LITERALLY THREW ME OFF AND I WAS DAMN PISSED. IT IS ALSO BIZARRE HOW IT LEFT THE ASSEMBLY LINE AND THE FINAL CHECK!!
      
      
      ANYWAY, THE FLIPKART GUYS WERE VERY HELPFUL, I GOT A CALL BACK THE SAME DAY AND THEY DID ARRANGE THE REPLACEMENT. IN TWO DAYS I GOT A NEW ONE FREE OF DEFECTS. I HOPE APPLE DOES IMPROVE ITS IN-PROCESS QUALITY CONTROL.
      
      
      I WAS THIS CLOSE IN SNAPPING BUYING ELECTRONICS FROM FLIPKART; BUT THEIR THROUGH PROFESSIONALISM IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE AND MAKING GOOD OF THE PROBLEM SURELY SPEAKS OF THEIR CHARACTER. TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL STICK TO THEM.
      
      
      THANKS GUYS.
      
      
      ABOUT THE PHONE, YOU KNOW IT, I KNOW IT; IT'S THE BEST OUT THERE...
      
      
      CHEERS,
      
      JAGANNATH."
IPhone 5S,4,"I HAVEN'T BEEN AN IPHONE USER SINCE THE IPHONE 3G. DURING THIS TIME I HAVE USED EVERY SINGLE HIGH-END ANDROID PHONE ON THE MARKET , STARTING WITH THE HTC DESIRE HD AND ENDING WITH THE GOOGLE NEXUS 4.
      
      THE REASON I WAS ON ANDROID WAS BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT ANDROID OFFERS. I AM STILL AN ANDROID USER &AMP; FAN AND STILL CONSIDER KITKAT TO BE SUPERIOR IN FEATURES &AMP; USABILITY THAN IOS 7. HAVING SAID THAT I GIVE A LOT OF IMPORTANCE ON HOW A DEVICE LOOKS &AMP; FEELS. IF I AM PAYING A PREMIUM FOR A PREMIUM DEVICE, I EXPECT IT TO LOOK NOTHING LESS THAN PREMIUM. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASON I REFRAIN FROM BUYING SAMSUNG PHONES AS THEY FEEL VERY CHEAP COMPARED TO THE COMPETITION.
      
      
      NOW THE ONLY DEVICES ON THE MARKET THAT MAKES ME DROOL ARE THE HTC ONE &AMP; THE IPHONE 5S GOLD. THAT IS WHY I WONT FEEL SHAME TO ADMIT THAT THIS IPHONE 5S PURCHASE WAS AN IMPULSIVE ONE. I JUST COULDNT RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF A GORGEOUS DEVICE AT A LURING PRICE. YES FOLKS I BOUGHT THIS GORGEOUS PHONE WHEN IT WAS LISTED FOR SOME STRANGE REASON FOR A PALTRY 45K.
      
      
      FLIPKART SERVICE WAS GREAT AS USUAL. DELIVERED THE PHONE IN TWO DAYS. HAVENT FOUND ANY DEFECTS IN THE PHONE AS OF NOW, BUT IN CASE I DO, I WILL SURELY UTILIZE THE 30 DAYS REPLACEMENT POLICY OF FK. THIS IS THE REASON I PREFER BUYING EXPENSIVE GADGETS FROM FK - PEACE OF MIND.
      
      
      COMING TO THE PHONE, FOLLOWING ARE THE PROS &AMP; CONS:
      
      
      PROS
      
      
      1. GORGEOUS
      
      2. NEAR PERFECT BUILT ( THERES A TINY CHIP AT THE BACK EDGE, BUT NOTHING MAJOR)
      
      3. GREAT DISPLAY QUALITY
      
      4. FAST
      
      5. THE GOLD VERSION IS THE MOST SEXY THING I HAVE EVER SEEN INCLUDING KATRINA KAIF ;)
      
      
      CONS
      
      
      1. NEEDS A BIGGER DISPLAY
      
      2. IOS 7 HAS A LOT OF TEETHING BUGS
      
      3. NEEDS A BIGGER BATTERY
      
      4. APPLE QA/QC NEEDS TO BE BETTER. A BRAND NEW DEVICE CANT SHIP WITH SMALL IMPERFECTIONS SUCH AS CHIPS OR DENTS OUT OF THE BOX.
      
      
      I HAVE PUT A SCRATCH GUARD ON BOTH FRONT &AMP; BACK &AMP; AM USING A SOFT TPU BACK COVER TO PROTECT MY INVESTMENT."
IPhone 5S,4,"I WOULD SAY ONE THING ABOUT APPLE AND APPLE 5S GOLD THIS IS A VERY VERY BEST PHONE AND OUTSTANDING BUILT QUALITY OF THIS PHONE..TOTALLY... BETTER PRODUCT..
      
      
      ONLY APPLE PHONE IS THE FOR THAT PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR IT AND QUE CAN WAIT OUTSIDE AT APPLE STORE IN INDIA ALSO..  THIS IS APPLE NOT ANY OTHER COMPANY CAN DO THIS THING.."
IPhone 5S,4,INDIANS HAVE GONE JUST CRAZY FOR A SIGN OF APPLE. NO DOUBT IT IS BEST SMARTPHONE EVER IN THE HISTORY OF PHONES BUT IT IS TOO HIGHLY PRICED. MARKET FORCED ME TO BUY THIS PHONE BUT AT LAST I AM HAPPY :)
IPhone 5S,4,"IT'S OBLIVIOUSLY A GREAT PHONE. GREAT EXPERIENCE VERY FAST.
      
      I FACE A PROBLEM THAT WHILE TRAVELLING ON WE GENERALLY PUT OUR MOBILE IN FLIGHT MODE, WHEN EVER WE ARE TRYING TO PUT IN NORMAL MODE IT IS NOT CATCHING SIGNAL.
      
      OVER ALL PHONE IS EXCELLENT, CAMERA IS COOL.
      
      I WILL GIVE 4.5/5"
IPhone 5S,4,"LET ME BE HONEST IN MY REVIEW. I OWN A BLACK 5S MODEL 16GB . LOOKS WISE SURELY THERE IS NO COMPARISON, PROCESSOR DAMN GOOD, SCREEN AWESOME ( DONT COMPARE BY PPI'S, IOS7 IS HEAVENLY) . WHEN BUYING A PHONE WORTH 50K , ONE SHOULD EXPECT ENDURANCE AND LONGEVITY, AND THIS PHONE PROVIDES THE SAME.
      
      
      THE ONLY CON I SEE IS THE BATTERY LIFE, VERY DISAPPOINTING , AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE SOFTWARE CHANGES RATHER THAN HARDWARE, WITH THE NEW UPGRADE IF YOU SWITCH ON  THE INTERNET, YOU'L HAVE YOUR 3G ON , AND THAT CONSUMES A HELL LOT OF BTTRY , EARLIER IT WAS 2G THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND YOU NEED TO ON 3G , BUT NOW 3G WILL BE ON AND THE ONLY OPTION GIVEN IS THAT OF 4G.
      
      IF YOU CAN SWITCH ON/OFF THE MOBILE DATA TO CONSUME BATTERY , THEN YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE ISSUES...
      
      
      AND NOW THE PREJUDICES , TRUST ME FOLKS BLACK IS THE ULTIMATE BEAUTY (MALE POINT OF VIEW, DONT JUST BUY GOLD COZ ITS IN HIGH DEMAND, BE PRAGMATIC) AND GIRLS YOU'LL LOOK MORE PRETTY WITH THE WHITE(SILVER AND GOLD)"
IPhone 5S,4,OVERALL GOOD FONE.I HARDLY SEE ANY DIFFERENCES IN 5 &AMP; 5S AND WHATEVER DIFFERENCES ARE THERE SORT OF USELESS
IPhone 5S,4,"PERFECT
      
      AS COMMITTED PROPERLY PACKED IN TIME DELIVERED ....
      
      NO COMPLAINTS....
      
      WILL BE SHOPPING AGAIN WITH THIS SELLER
      
      NICE SELLER ...."
IPhone 5S,4,THE PHONE IS JUST AWESOME.. THE TOUCH ID WORKS FLAWLESS .. AND ACTUALLY I HAVE SOME DISSATISFACTION THAT THE PACKAGING OF A 53K PHONE THAT I RECEIVED IS NOT UP-TO THE MARK.. ELSE.. EVERY THING IS FINE ..
IPhone 5S,4,"THE PHONE IS PREMIUM TO HOLD AND ITS VERY LIGHT (112G). THE GOLD COLOR IS AWESOME AND IOS7 MAKES THE PHONE EVEN BETTER. BATTERY WILL LAST FOR A DAY IF YOU USE THE PHONE ON WIFI, IF YOU ARE USING 3G THEN IT WOULD BE 10 HRS MAX.
      
      
      THE PHONE CHARGING IS SUPERFAST, AS THE NAME SUGGEST ITS A LIGHTNING CHARGER, OTHER THAN THIS THE PHONE HAS ALL OF APPLE'S PROPITIATORY FEATURES. THE TOUCH ID IS GOOD BUT I DON'T FIND IT AMAZING AND ITS NOT WORTH THE REASON FOR THE PHONE'S COST.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS INSANELY COSTLY, THAT TOO IN INDIA. ACCORDING TO STATS THE PHONE IS 22% COSTLIER THAN THE AVERAGE INCOME OF AN INDIAN.
      
      
      I STARTED USING SMARTPHONES IN 2008 AND MY FIRST SMARTPHONE FOR IPHONE 2G, I GOT TO REPLACE THIS SINCE THE SCREEN GOT CRACKED. THE I SWITCHED TO 4 SMARTPHONES (GALAXY S(I9000), GALAXY NOTE1, BLACKBERRY CURVE, LUMIA 820,) AND NONE OF THEM WERE COMFORTABLE AS IPHONE."
IPhone 5S,4,"THERE IS SOMETHING A PROSPECTIVE BUYER SHOULD UNDERSTAND BEFORE EVEN LOOKING TO BUY AN IPHONE 5S.
      
      I'M NO APPLE FANBOY, TRUST ME, BUT IT IS THE BEST PHONE AVAILABLE ON MARKET RIGHT NOW.
      
      NOT THE MOST VALUE FOR MONEY, BUT THE ULTIMATE BEST. THE PRIMERA.
      
      
      LOOKS WISE, I'D SAY ITS NOT A BAD JOB. THE SAME SIGNATURE LOOK THAT IT HAS CARRIED ON SINCE LONG. THE GOLD AND GRAY LOOK FANTASTIC, AND FEELS NICE IN HAND AS WELL. BUT LOOKS AREN'T EVEN THE INTRO TO THE WHOLE STORY.
      
      
      THE A7 CHIP INSIDE IS THE BEST PROCESSOR AVAILABLE ON MARKET FOR MOBILE DEVICES, EVEN BETTER THAN THE TOP OF THE LINE SNAPDRAGON 800 WHICH IS THE BEST ANY ANDROID/WINDOWS PHONE CAN OFFER.
      
      THE PERFORMANCE GAINS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO MATTER TO A CASUAL USER, OR ANY USER UNLESS YOU WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR IT. ITS LIKE SAYING ONES A LOCKHEAD BLACKBIRD AND OTHERS A FALCON HTV2. FYI, THEY'RE BOTH INSANELY FAST AIRCRAFTS. FOR PEOPLE LIKE US, ITS INSIGNIFICANT WHICH IS REALLY FASTER. THE 64BIT ARCHITECTURE WOULDNT MATTER MUCH TO THE NORMAL USER AS LONG AS THE APPLICATIONS DONT MAKE USE OF IT. ITS JUST APPLE BEING PARANOID AS USUAL ABOUT BEING FUTURE PROOF.
      
      IN ADDITION TO THE PROCESSOR CAPABILITIES, A MAJOR PLUS OF APPLE DEVICES IS THAT IOS7 WAS OPTIMIZED FOR A7, WHILE ANDROID(KITKAT OR JBEAN OR WHATEVER) IS NOT. ANDROID RUNS ON A VM WHICH LEECHES OUT A BIT OF THE POTENCY.
      
      THE GPU PERFORMANCE IS COMMENDABLE, AND THE MOTION PROCESSOR M7 IS ALSO A UNIQUE CHARACTERISTIC, THOUGH IF ITS FULL POTENTIAL CAN BE USED IN NORMAL SCENARIO REMAINS TO BE SEEN. YET.
      
      THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER IS A NEW INNOVATION, AND SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY GOOD UNLESS YOUR HANDS ARE TOO SWEATY. CURRENTLY ITS USE IS LIMITED THOUGH IN TIME IN-APP AUTHENTICATION AS WELL AS CREDIT CARD/BANK ACC/WALLET AUTHENTICATION COULD ALSO BE DONE USING IT. LOTS TO LOOK FORWARD TO.
      
      
      DOWNSIDES ARE ALSO THERE, IOS7 NEEDS MORE OPTIMIZATION TO BE BETTER. AND SOME MIGHT PREFER A BIGGER SCREEN TO UTILIZE ALL THAT JUICE INSIDE. THOUGH IMO THE SIZE SEEMS OPTIMUM, NOT TOO BIG FOR A PHONE, AND NOT TOO SMALL TO BE DISAPPOINTED. THE BATTERY COULD BE A BIT IMPROVED TOO, TO LAST MORE THAN A DAY. A7/M7/POWERVR6 DOES DRINK A LOT OF POWER.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, I5S IS NOT YOUR CASUAL WHIP-IT-OUT-OF-THE-POCKET-AND-THROW-IT-TO-THE-BED SMARTPHONE, ITS A CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED MARVEL. POWERFUL, FUTURE PROOF UPTO MAYBE 2+YEARS, WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING ANY OTHER PHONE CAN BOAST ABOUT. ONLY TWO THINGS STAND IN THE WAY OF IT BEING THE OPTIMUM PHONE, 1ST BEING ON THE HIGHER SIDE OF THE FOOD CHAIN, AND 2ND THE MORE IMPORTANT ONE, WE DONT NEED THAT MUCH POWER OR PERFORMANCE. YET. THE APP ECOSYSTEM, HOWEVER LARGE AND VARIED IT IS, STILL DOESNT HAVE ANY APPLICATIONS THAT MAKE USE OF THE A7/M7 PROCESSORS INSIDE, OR THE 64BIT ARCHITECTURE FOR THAT MATTER. AND WITHOUT IT, ITS JUST A LAMBORGHINI ON INDIAN ROADS. STILL, IT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PHONE ON THE MARKET. AND AGAIN, IT IS BETTER THAN ANY, AND YOU DON'T GET TO BE THE BEST WITHOUT BEATING THE BEST, AND IT COSTS TO DO THAT, LIKE, A LOT."
IPhone 5S,4,"THIS IS THE BEAST IN SMARTPHONE .YOU CANN'T COMPARE IT WITH OTHER ANDROID PHONES.AWESOME PERFORMANCE,STUNNING LOOKS AND BEST APPS MARKET ."
IPhone 5S,4,VERY GOOD DEAL AND FAST DELIVERY. ONLY ONE ISSUE THAT THE PRICE OF PRODUCT DROPPED TWICE (FEW 100 RS THOUGH) RIGHT AFTER I PLACED ORDER (BEFORE DELIVERY) AND THE PRODUCT WAS UNDER PRICE MATCH GUARANTEE; HOWEVER I WAS GIVEN DIFFERENCE FOR ONLY FIRST PRICE DROP THAT TOO IN 'FLIPKART WALLET' WHICH IS USABLE ONLY WHEN I BUY PRODUCT FROM THE SAME SELLER AGAIN...SOME GUARANTEE!!
IPhone 5S,3,"EXCEPT THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER, THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS PHONE AND THE IPHONE 5.
      
      
      APPLE USED TO BE GOOD BUT NOW THEY ARE JUST RELEASING NEW PHONES JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO EVERY YEAR.
      
      
      AND IT SURELY DOES NOT OFFER THE MONEY'S WORTH FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY.
      
      
      I THINK ITS BETTER TO LEAVE THE IPHONE FOR THIS YEAR."
IPhone 5S,3,"IPHONE 5S IS A GREAT DEVICE WITH GOOD PERFORMANCE, AND THE LATEST IOS 7 IS GREAT TOO. THIS WAS MY FIRST IOS DEVICE, AND I'D SEEN SO MANY FEATURES LACKING IN IOS AND MOST OF THE APPS ARE PAID IN THE APP STORE WHILE THEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR FREE IN THE PLAY STORE. I WILL CLEARLY PREFER ANDROID OVER IPHONE. I LOVE MY HTC ONE :D"
IPhone 5S,3,"PROS: PRETTY SMOOTH OS, BEST GAMING EXPERIENCE , GREAT AUDIO &AMP; CAMERA QUALITY.
      
      CONS: FAST DRAINING OF BATTERY (THOUGH IT GETS CHARGED VERY QUICKLY) , HIGH PRICE AND FINGER    PRINT INCONSISTENCY."
IPhone 5S,3,RECIEVED THE PRODUCT MUCH AHEAD IN TIME AS PROMISED BY FLIPKART.BUT SUPRISED TO FIND THAT THE BILLED IMEI AND THE PRODUCT IMEI DON'T MATCH.RECIEVED THE PRODUCT IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING AND PRODUCT IS WORKING FINE.GREAT PRODUCT TO GO FOR AT THE BEST PRICE BY FLIPKART.
IPhone 5S,2,"APPLE WAS ONCE KNOWN TO BE AN INNOVATING COMPANY IN TERMS OF DESIGN AND TECH IN THEIR PRODUCTS.THAT NAME IS NOW ALL BUT GONE NOW A DAYS.
      
      IPHONE 5S IS YET ANOTHER EG OF THE COMPANY WHO CAN NO LONGER REALLY INNOVATE.WHAT DOES THIS HAVE FOR IT TO BE PRICED AT RS.53K THAT TOO FOR THE 16GB VERSON (32 GB IS 62K).LETS TAKE EACH FEATURE AND COMPONENT OF THE PHONE AND DO A COMPARISON WITH THE COMPETITION.
      
      
      CAMERA
      
      THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST USED PART OF A SMART PHONE.APPLE ITSELF HAS PRIDED IN ITS CAMERAS AND ADVERTISED IT WELL BUT THE FACT REMAINS IPHONE CAMERA HAS NEVER BEEN THE BEST IN MARKET AND THIS IS ESPEACIALY VISIBLE IN THIS CURRENT GEN.SMARTPHONE CAMERAS OF OTHER PHONES ESP NOKIA LUMIA 1020 ARE MILES AHEAD OF IPHONE 5S CAMERA IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT.THIS INCLUDES OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION,LOSSELESS ZOOM,OVER SAMPELING,FOCUSING AFTER PHOTO HAS BEEN TAKEN,RAW DIGITAL NEGATIVES ARE SOME OF THE FEATURES IPHONE 5S DOESN'T HAVE AND LUMIA 1020 HAS AND THESE FEATURES AMOUNT TO A LOT IN NORMAL EVERYDAY USE.IPHONE CAMERA'S NIGHT OR LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE IS POOR WHEN COMPARED WITH THE 41MP MONSTER SITTING ON LUMIA 1020.
      
      MICROPHONES
      
      SORRY APPLE NOKIA BEAT YOU AGAIN IN THIS AREA. SEARCH ONLINE FOR HAAC MICROPHONES BY NOKIA AND YOU WILL WHAT AN AMAZING PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY AND  INNOVATION ITS.
      
      
      NAVIGATION SOFTWARE,MAP APPLICATION.
      
      THE DEFAULT MAP APPLICATION IN IOS 7 IS THE APPLE'S OWN APPLE MAPS.IF YOU DON?T KNOW THIS REMAINS THE WORST MAP SOFTWARE AMONG ITS COMPETITION WHICH INCLUDES GOOGLE MAPS(DEFAULT IN ANDROID),HERE(NOKIA)MAPS(DEFAULT IN ALL NOKIA SMARTPHONES,JOLLA AND KINDLE ANDROID ALSO USED BY 4 OUT OF 5 CARS WITH GPS) BING MAPS ( DEFAULT IN NON LUMIA WIN PHONES).APPLE MAPS HAS BEEN NOTORIOUS FOR ITS INNACURATE DATA WHICH HAS LEAD PEOPLE TO DRIVE STRAIGHT TO AIRPORT RUNWAYS.YOU WILL HOWEVER GET GOOGLE MAPS AND HERE MAPS IN APP STORE BUT APPLE MAPS WILL REMAIN AS YOUR DEFAULT MAP APP.
      
      
      DESIGN
      
      NOTHING MUCH HAS CHANGE FROM IPHONE 5 AND 4S.ITS ALLMOST  SAME ITSELF.
      
      
      SCREEN
      
      APPLE SCREEN IS ONE OF THE BEST IN MARKET BUT IT REMAINS A BIT SMALL.I AM NOT A FAN OF BIG SCREEN BUT THE SCREEN CAN BE BUMPED TO 4.3 WHICH IS SWEET SPOT.
      
      
      PROCESSOR.
      
      PROCESSOR IS APPLE'S PROPRIETERY A7 WHICH GIVES FAST PERFORMANCE THANKS TO GOOD OS OPTIMISATION.THIS  IS A PLUS WHEN COMPARED WITH ANDROID BUT NOT SO MUCH WHEN COMPARING WIN PHONE WHOSE LOW END PHONES LIKE  LUMIA 520 IS COMPARABLE WITH GALAXY S3.BEING 64 BIT DOESN'T SERVE ANY PURPOSE AS NO APPS ARE NOW MADE FOR 64 BIT.BY THE TIME THEY MAKE YOU WILL BE THROWING AWAY THIS PHONE AFTER LONG USE.
      
      
      OVERALL
      
      BUYING THIS MAKES LITTLE PRACTICAL SENSE ESP AT THIS PRICE. THERE ARE AMAZING PRODUCTS FROM OTHER MANUFACTURERS WHICH OFFER BETTER PHONES AT CHEAPER PRICE. PHONES LIKE LUMIA 1020,HTC ONE,LG G2 EACH OF WHICH HAS INNOVATING FEATURES AND DOUBLE THE MEMORY.ONLY TRULY IGNORANT PEOPLE BUYS IPHONES BY THEIR CHOICE.THIS FACT IS HIGH LIGHTED BY THE HIGH MARKET SHARE IPHONE  ENJOYS IN US AND WE KNOW THE LEVEL OF IGNORANCE  AMERICANS HAVE (NOT ALL AMERICANS I MEAN)."
IPhone 5S,2,IF YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEND.. GO AHEAD AND BUY IT! BUT THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH.. FOR THESE FEATURES.. IT SHOULD NOT EVEN BE 40K I THINK 30K-35K IS A GOOD DEAL.. FOR 10K LESS YOU CAN GET A HTC ONE ( CHECK IT OUT ON YOUTUBE ITS REALLY AWESOME! ) I THINK APPLE IS NOT GOOD WITHOUT STEVE.. 50K FOR 16GB?? THAT IS ROBBERY! BUT IT IS A GREAT PHONE AND AS I SAID BEFORE BUY IT IF YOU ARE SUPER RICH!
IPhone 5S,2,"THE EXPERIENCE OF SHOPPING WITH FLIPKART WAS GOOD. HOWEVER, IT IS A PAIN TO PROCESS RETURNS AND REFUNDS IF YOU BUY APPLE PRODUCTS.
      
      
      THE IPHONE 5S I BOUGHT HAS A RATTLING POWER-ON/WAKE-UP BUTTON. ON CALLING FLIPKART I WAS ASKED TO GO TO AN APPLE STORE AND GET IT CHECKED AND GET A JOB SHEET CERTIFYING THAT THERE IS SOME REAL PROBLEM WITH THE PHONE IN ORDER FOR FLIPKART TO REPLACE/REFUND IT.
      
      
      SO, I DID THAT, AND NOW FLIPKART WANTS A SCAN COPY OF IT AND WILL CHECK WITH APPLE. GOD KNOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE UPTO."
IPhone 5S,2,"THE LAST GOOD PHONE THAT APPLE RELEASED WAS THE IPHONE 4S. IT WAS A GREAT PHONE AND EVEN APPLE HATERS AGREED TO THAT. BUT AFTER THAT THE PHONES APPLE HAS RELEASED ARE ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. THE IPHONE 5 CAME WITH A SLIGHTLY BIGGER SCREEN AND A 10K ADDED TO THE COST! AND NOW THIS USELESS PHONE. WHAT DO WE HAVE NOW? A FINGER PRINT SCANNER!! WELL THAT MUST REALLY USEFUL FOR WHAT? YOU CAN EASILY LOCK YOUR PHONE USING A PIN. IT IS FOOLISH TO PAY SO MUCH FOR JUST A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT. AND THEN WE HAVE A 64 BIT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE. ONCE AGAIN, IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PRACTICAL ADVANTAGE. THERE IS REALLY NO COST BENEFIT TO THIS PHONE. THE SUDDEN LACK OF INNOVATION IN APPLE'S PRODUCTS SHOWS HOW MUCH THE COMPANY WAS DEPENDENT ON STEVE JOBS.
      
      
      I WAS A APPLE FAN BUT APPLE PRODUCTS ARE REALLY GOING DOWN WHEN IT COMES TO INNOVATION. THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN APPLE PHONES. SAMSUNG AND HTC ARE COMING OUT TO BE THE BETTER BRANDS.
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS NOT BAD. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS CHARGING YOU MORE THAN 50K FOR A PHONE, IT SHOULD REALLY BE WORTH IT. THIS PHONE IN THE REAL SENSE IS NOT WORTH MORE THAN 35K. THE BRAND IS JUST TOO OVER HYPED. THE ONLY GOOD THING YOU CAN DO WITH AN APPLE PHONE IS SHOW OFF."
IPhone 5S,1,"71.5K FOR 112 GRAMS OF METAL AND GLASS ...IS POINTLESS
      
      
      YOU CAN BUY AN  IPHONE ON CONTRACT IN THE  US WHICH IS VERY VERY CHEAP COMPARING TO THIS !!
      
      I AM AGAIN SAYING.... DONT BUY"
IPhone 5S,1,"AFTER READING THE FIRST COMMENT ON THE PAGE...""I WORKED 60HRS A WEEK FOR THIS""...!!! 'SERIOUSLY ' !!!
      
      PLS GUYS BEFORE BUYING CONSIDER A PSYCHIATRIST FIRST PLS !!!
      
      
      CZ ITS THE PHONE (IPHONE) ...MEANS TO CONNECT PEAPLE !!!"
IPhone 5S,1,"APPLE HAS BEEN CRAZY BUT DIDN'T THINK THIS BAD....
      
      AT THIS PRICE I WOULD GET MUCH MUCH BETTER PHONE LIKE THE NOTE 3.... EVEN THE GALAXY S4 IS BETTER THAN THIS EVEN THOUGH IT IS OLDER, ALL FLAGSHIP MODELS OF ANDROID OEMS ARE BETTER THAN THIS....
      
      
      AT THIS PRICE WHAT DO THEY OFFER???
      
      
      FIRST OF ALL NO SD CARD SLOT! I CANT EVEN INCREASE THE MEMORY, IF I WANT MORE MEMORY I NEED TO PAY MORE LIKE SOME 9K FOR 32GB N 18K FOR 64GB... LOL THATS CRAZY.
      
      THEN THE CAMERA, IT IS JUST 8MP WITH THE APERTURE BIG AT F/2.2, SERIOUSLY WHAT CAN U GET BY JUST INCREASING THE APERTURE, NOW OTHER COMPANIES ARE OFFERING 13MP FOR THEIR FLAGSHIPS
      
      THEN IS THEIR CLOSED OS.. I AGREE THAT IT CANNOT BE INFECTED BY VIRUS BUT STILL THAT DOESNT MEAN U KEEP IT THAT CLOSED NO CUSTOMIZATION
      
      
      TALKING ABOUT THE HARDWARE IT IS TOO OLD U JUST HV A DUALCORE PROCESSOR N JUST 1GB RAM
      
      THE SCREEN RESOLUTION- 640 X 1136 PIXELS, IT IS VERY LESS, TODAY THE HIGHEST SCREEN RESOLUTION IN SMARTPHONES IS 2K RESOLUTION N THEN FULLHD, THEY ARENT EVEN GIVING 720P RESOLUTION... N THE RETINA DISPLAY IS JUST A MARKETING GIMMICK NOTHING GOOD ABOUT IT, IT IS JUST A LCD DISPLAY WITH A NAME GIVEN TO IT!! WHOM R U FOOLING APPLE?
      
      THIS PHONE DOESNT HAVE MUCH FEATURES AS COMPARED TO ANDROID
      
      THERE R MANY FLAWS IN THE PRODUCT IN FACT ALL IPHONES..
      
      
      RATHER I WOULD SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE WILLING TO BUY AT THIS PRICE SHOULD BUY FLAGSHIPS FROM OTHER COMPANIES LIKE THE NOTE 3, LG G2, HTC ONE, SONY XPERIA Z1, ETC
      
      THIS PHONE IS NOT WORTH BUYING
      
      
      THERE IS NO -5 OPTION SO I SELECTED 1 STAR :P"
IPhone 5S,1,DEAR FRIENDS PLZ DONT BUY THIS IPHONE THEY THINK INDIAN ARE FULLS ( ACTUALLY WE ARE ) RS=71000 IT IS COMADY PRICE
IPhone 5S,1,"GUYS,

AND U ARE GIVING ALMOST 1L TO A STUPID 4 INCH PHONE. REALLY ARE YOU GUYS REALLY LIKE TO BE IDOTS FOR PURCHASING A PHONE FOR THIS MUCH PRICE?"
IPhone 5S,1,HELLO FRIENDS. I HAVE USED THIS PHONE FOR 1 WEEK AND HAVE TO SELL IT. FROM THE FIRST DAY OF PURCHASE I GOT HEATING PROBLEM.AS I START USING INTERNET PHONE GETS FULLY HEATED FROM FRONT AND BACK. I WENT TO SERVICE CENTRE AND THEY TOLD THEY WILL KEPP FOR 1 DAY. AFTER 1 DAY THEY TOLD ME ITS NORMAL. ALL IPHONES GET HEATED BECAUSE OF ALUMINIUM BODY AND UR PHONE GETS SOME EXTRA HEATING PROBLEM. I TOLD THEM THAT I CANT EVEN TOUCH PHONE AFTER 10 MINS. AT LAST I HAVE TO SELL IT IN THE MARKET. 1 STAR FOR THIS PRODUCT. BE AWARE FRIENDS.

IPhone 5S,1,"IPHONE 5S HAS ONLY TWO NEW FEATURE THAT ARE WORTH NOTICING, THE TOUCH ID SENSOR AND THE 64 BIT ARCHITECTURE, THERE ARE PHONES ON THE MARKET WHICH ARE MUCH CHEAPER AND ARE MORE POWERFUL. FOR E.G. THE LG G2 OR THE GOOGLE NEXUS 5.EVEN WITH THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE N5 AND G2 NOT HAVING 64 BIT ARCHITECTURE THEY CAN STILL EASILY MATCH UP AGAINST THE 5S. NOT ONLY IS N5 SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER IT'S ONLY FLAW IS ITS 2300MAH BATTERY, WHEREAS THE G2 HAS 3000MAH BATTERY AND IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL COMPARED TO THE 5S. THE 5S COMES WITH A 1GB RAM DDR3 AND BOTH ANDROID PHONES ARE DOUBLE THIS (AT 2GB DDR3). THIS MAYBE SURPRISING TO HEAR BUT THE ONLY REASON THE 5S IS AS POPULAR AS IT IS TODAY, IS BECAUSE OF THE BRAND NAME, APPLE - APPEARANCE COSTS."
IPhone 5S,1,"IT'S A GREAT DEVICE, BUT YOU SHOULD PRAY THAT IT DOESN'T GO BAD, AND IF IT DOES, YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH SCREWED, AS APPLE SUPPORT IN INDIA DOESN'T CARE, NO MATTER HOW HIGH IN THEIR SUPPORT CHAIN YOU REACH. THEY WILL SIMPLY NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE, AND TRY TO SHRUG YOU OFF, AND GET YOU TO GET IT REPAIRED ON YOUR OWN, LET ALONE REPLACING THE DEVICE, AS THEY DO OUTSIDE INDIA."
IPhone 5S,1,MY GALAXY GRAND IS BETTER THAN THIS. I WILL NOT RATE HALF EVEN 2 THIS I PHONE BLOODY......... THIS IS STILL 4 INCH MY GRAND 5 INCH. ITZ HAVING IOS7 MINE 4.4.2 KITKAT.
IPhone 5S,1,"ORDERED AN IPHONE 5S SPACE GREY, PHONE WAS DEFECTED . LOCK BUTTON WAS PRODUCING RATTLING SOUND AND BUTTON TOO LOOSE. I COMPLAINED AND THEY SUGGESTED TO GO TO APPLE STORE WHICH IS VERY FAR FROM MY PLACE NEARLY 250 KM. THEY AGREED FOR REPLACEMENT OF PHONE. AND I GOT THE REPLACED PHONE. NOW THAT REPLACED PHONE IS WORSE THAN PREVIOUS.
      
      PRODUCES RATTLING SOUND , SPEAKERPHONE PRODUCES SCRATCHING SOUND WHICH IRRITATING WHILE SPEAKING AND BATTERY DRAIN EARLY THAN PREVIOUS.
      
      WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
      
      FLIPKART, YOU HAVE LOST A VERY REGULAR CUSTOMER.
      
      I RECOMMEND TO BUY FROM APPLE STORE, BY PAYING 53.5K RATHER THAN BUYING DEFECTED ONE.
      
      DINT EXPECT SUCH A HORRIBLE SERVICE FROM WS RETAILER AND FLIPKART.
      
      HUGELY DISAPPOINTED TO THE CORE."
IPhone 5S,1,PEOPLE ARE TELLING NOTE 3 WITH ALL ITS MASSIVE SPECS AS A SHIT BECOUSE OF ITS PRICE. BUT THIS MOBILE WITH 16 GB MEMORY COSTS MORE THAN NOTE 3 AS GOOD NEVER BUY A APPLE PHNE

IPhone 5S,1,"THE PRODUCT DELIVERED (30/12/13-EVENING) TO ME WAS DEFECTIVE . IMAGINE SPENDING AROUND 50K AND ENDING UP WITH A DEFECTIVE DEVICE. THE DEFECT WAS THE CALL QUALITY,THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH AUDIO CHIP IN THE PHONE DELIVERED AND HENCE I WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE AND RECEIVE CALLS AS I COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING.I THEN RAISED A REQUEST FOR REFUND ON 31/12/13 - MORNING. THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS THE RETAILER (WS RETAIL) HAS DISAPPROVED THE REFUND AND REPLACEMENT AS WELL. I THE CALLED UP THE FLIPKART SUPPORT ( THE SO CALLED SUPPORT THEY PROVIDE). THE FIRST RESPONSE WAS THEY WILL SET UP A CALL TO GET THE PROBLEM CHECKED AN I WILL RECEIVE A CALL WITHIN 24 HRS. NEXT DAY I DID RECEIVE A CALL AND FLIPKART ASSOCIATE SAID FOR APPLE PRODUCTS THEY CANNOT HELP, I NEED TO CONTACT THE APPLE CUSTOMER AND THUS FROM THE THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED THE ONUS IS ON THEIR CUSTOMER AND NOT THEM TO GET THE FAULTY MOBILE REPAIRED. I HAD THEN REACH TO FLIPKART A NUMBER OF TIMES TO EXPLAIN THAT THEY CAN JUST SELL A DEFECTIVE PIECE AND EXPECT THE CUSTOMER THEN TO GET IT REPAIRED. THERE RESPONSE WAS THAT I WILL RECEIVE A CALL FROM THE TECH SUPPORT WHICH I HAVE NOT RECEIVED TILL DATE. I HAD TO EVENTUALLY GO TO APPLE AND GET THE PHONE REPAIRED AND GET THE PROBLEM RESOLVED.
      
      
      THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS LET THE PROSPECT CUSTOMER OF FLIPKART TO BE AWARE OF KIND OF AFTER-SALE SUPPORT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A VERY PRAGMATIC DECISION BEFORE BUYING.
      
      
      FLIPKART HAS SURELY LOST ONE CUSTOMER AND I HOPE THEY LEARN THEIR LESSON AND DON'T CHEAT THE CUSTOMER GOING FORWARD."

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND WORTH FOR MONEY. IT IS DEFINITELY NOT A BIG UPGRADE FROM THE CANVAS HD BUT DOES HAVE A BETTER BUILD, CAMERAS AND ALSO MORE STORAGE ALONG WITH ALL THE EXTRA SOFTWARE FEATURES.NICE PRODUCT."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"AMAZING PHONE, THE PUNCH FROM MICROMAX HAS HIT THE RIGHT SPOT. AN INDIAN ANSWER TO MAJOR PHONE MANUFACTURERS WITH THE BEST QUALITY &AMP; FEATURES, WITH A TRUE INDIAN PRICING."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"AT FIRST I WAS WORRIED ABOUT BUYING MICROMAX PRODUCT. RECENTLY LOT OF FRIENDS IN MY CIRCLE GOT CANVAS SERIES PHONES AND HAD USING FROM LONG TIME. FINALLY I WENT AHEAD WITH THIS PHONE. PHONE WAS DELIVERED IN 2 DAYS.
      
      
      PHONE DESIGN HAS CHANGED A LOT FROM CANVAS HD. IT'S CAMERA WORKS AWESOME IN DAY LIGHT. YOU MAY FEEL SAD AT PHOTO QUALITY IN DARK / NIGHT. SCREEN IS HIGHER RESOLUTION, TEXT, ICONS AND IMAGES LOOK MUCH SHARPER COMPARED TO QHD PHONES (
      
      VIDEO QUALITY WAS AWESOME). THERE IS NO PIXELATION. IT'S GPS IS BIT SLOW. ONE OF THE THING I LOVE ABOUT MICROMAX IS THEY PROVIDE STOCK ANDROID. BATTERY LIFE IS JUST FINE (NOT FAR GOOD AND NOT FAR BAD).
      
      
      AGAIN THERE IS NEWS THAT MICROMAX WILL ROLL ANDROID KITKAT ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      OVERALL I LOVED THE PRODUCT. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE SOLED IT AT BIT LOW PRICE."

      THE CAMERA AND ALL PREINSTALLED FEUTURES ARE JUST AWSOME......ESPICIALLY THE SMART PAUSE AND THE GESTURE CONTROLS....
      
      BATTERY BACK UP IS ALSO VERY GOOD....
      
      YOU CAN RUN HIGH GRAPHICS GAMES VERY SMOOTHLY LIKE NOVA3,ASPHALT 8,NEED FOR SPEED MOSTWANTED..ETC

      WOULD RECOMMEND BOTH FLIPKART AND MICROMAX CANVAS 4 TO EVERYONE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"CAMERA : IT TAKES A WHILE TO FOCUS. BUT ONCE IT IS DONE, THE PICTURE CLARITY IS JUST AMAZING. IT GIVES PROPER 'DEPTH OF FIELD'. LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. FRONT CAM CANT BE COMPARED TO ANY OTHER. 5MP FRONT CAM GIVES HIGH CLARITY PHOTOS.
      
      
      DISPLAY : ITS SUPER CLEAR AND VIVID, BUT THE SCREEN HAS A BLUEISH TONE. VIEWING ANGLES ARE GREAT.
      
      
      BATTERY : 2000MAH BATTERY IS NOT SUFFICIENT IF YOU USE INTERNET A LOT.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE : OVERALL GOOD. IN FACT, MIND BLOWING AT THIS PRICE RANGE."

ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM AT ALL !! I COMPLETELY LOVE THIS PHONE. I HAVE EVEN DROPPED IT TWICE BY ACCIDENT, NOT EVEN A SINGLE SCRATCH ! BATTERY BACKUP IS OKAY. FOR THE CON FACTORS, IT GETS HOT WHEN I USE IT FOR A LONGER TIME CONTINUOUSLY AND THE BACK CAMERA IS BAD FOR 13MP ESP DURING LOW LIGH CONDITIONS (FRONT CAMERA GIVES MORE CLARITY THAN BACK CAMERA), BUT IT IS MANAGEABLE. FOR THE PROS, IT WILL GO FOR PAGES SO I'M NOT TELLING IT HERE. OVERALL A VERY GOOD SMARTPHONE FOR REASONABLE RATE FROM MICROMAX. CHEERS !"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"FIRST OF ALL THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING THE PRODUCT WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER PLACING THE ORDER.I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM 1MONTH,THE PHONE IS AWESOME AT IT'S RANGE.NO LAGS WHILE PLAYING GAMES.TOTAL GIVEN INTERNAL USER AVAILABLE MEMORY IS 12GB OUT OF THAT 2GB IS FOR APPS AND REMAINING 10GB IS FOR USER.IT HAS A 13 MEGA PIXEL CAMERA WHICH SHOOTS IMAGES CLEARLY BUT IN LOW LIGHT IMAGE CLARITY IS WORST BECAUSE THE LIGHTENING OF THE FLASH LIGHT IS LOW AND 5 MEGA PIXEL FRONT FACING CAMERA WHICH IS GOOD FOR VIDEO CALLING AND SKYPE CALLS.BUT THE ONLY DEFECT IS BATTERY DOESN'T LAST FOR A LONG TIME.ON THE CONTINUOUS USAGE OF PHONE THE BATTERY LASTS FOR 7-8HRS.DON'T USE THE FLIP COVER PROVIDED WITH THE PHONE,IT'S MADE OF PLASTIC AND IT DAMAGES THE WHOLE SCREEN.THE PHONE LOOKS ARE ALSO GREAT AND IT HAS A GORILLA GLASS WHICH IS SCRATCH RESISTANT.AND THERE ARE SOME SMART GESTURES SAME AS LIKE SAMSUNG GALAXY S4.INTERNET SPEED ON DATA CONNECTION IS ALSO VERY FAST THE SPEED OF INTERNET ON DATA CONNECTION IS ALMOST EQUAL TO SPEED OF BROADBAND."

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"HAVING HAD 2 CANVAS MODELS PREVIOUSLY THIS CANVAS 4 IS THE BEST OF THE BUNCH.

I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH ANY OF MY CANVAS PHONES AND MY LOCAL SERVICE CENTRE HAS ALWAYS UPDATED MY PREVIOUS PHONES WITH A INSTANT RESPONSE.
      
      I HOWEVER DISLIKED THE COVER THAT CAME WITH THE PHONE AND REPLACED WITH A STANDARD ONE WHICH PREVENTED DAMAGE TO THE SCREEN AND FELT A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE HAND.
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS FINE A FULL CHARGE LAST THE FULL DAY I USE WI FI UP TO 8HRS A DAY AND FIND NO PROBLEM.

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"HI,
      
      
      THANKS FOR FLIPKART TEAM FOR OFFERING ME THE MICROMAX CANVAS 4. I WAS SUFFERING FLIPKART STORE OVER A MONTH FOR THE REDUCTION OF PRICE FOR CANVAS AND FINALLY I GOT THE PRICE REDUCED ON REPUBLIC DAY. IMMEDIATELY, I ORDERED THE DEVICE AND WITH 3 DAYS I GOT THE PRODUCT DELIVERED TO MY LOCATION. I WAS TOO EXITED...!! TO OPERATE.
      
      NOW ITS BEEN TWO WEEKS, I HAVE USING THE DEVICE FOR GAMES, SURFING THE INTERNET, CHATTING ETC.
      
      WELL I WOULD LIKE TO REVIEW THE PRODUCT FOR REST OF YOU PEOPLE THOSE WHO WHICH TO BUY THE SMARTPHONE.
      
      
      DISPLAY
      
      
      1) GOOD DISPLAY WITH 5 INCH DISPLAY.
      
      2) LOW BUDGET PHONE PROVIDING GORILLA GLASS DISPLAY.
      
      
      PLATFORM
      
      
      1) I HAD A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE WITH ANDROID V4.2.1 JELLY BEAN AND I AM TOO HAPPY CANVAS 4 IS EXPECTED TO GET ANDROID V4.4 KITKAT UPDATE VERY SOON.
      
      2) POWERVR SGX 544 GRAPHICS WHICH GIVES YOU AN UNINTERRUPTED EXPERIENCE WHILE GAMING.
      
      
      CAMERA
      
      
      ONE MORE ADVANTAGE IS THE CAMERA, ITS A BIGGIE WITH 13 MP OF REAR CAMERA AND 5 MP OF FRONT CAMERA WHICH WILL MAKE YOUR VIDEO CHAT VERY CLEAR.
      
      
      STORAGE
      
      
      NOW COMING TO THE STORAGE PART, I DONT HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS BECAUSE 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY OUT OF WHICH 10.02 GB IS USER AVAILABLE AND 2.4 GB IS RESERVED FOR APPS INSTALLATION. AND ALSO CAN BE EXPANDED UPTO 32 GB VIA MICRO SD CARD SLOT WHICH MAKE IT A WIDE STORAGE DEVICE THAN YOU HAVE SPACE FOR YOUR THINGS IN YOUR LIVING ROOM.... :P
      
      
      BATTERY
      
      
      NOW THIS PART MAKES ME QUITE DISAPPOINT BECAUSE AFTER THE BATTERY IS 100% IN THE MORNING, IT LASTS FOR 45-55% IN THE EVENING WHILE COMING BACK FROM COLLEGE. OTHERWISE IT HAS GOT A GOOD STANDBY TIME. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXTRODINARY SMARTPHONE OUT FOR YEAR 2013 IF MICROMAX HAVE PACKED THE DEVICE ABOVE 2000 MAH BATTERY.
      
      
      OVERALL I SCORE THIS PRODUCT 80 OUT OF 100.
      
      
      I RECOMMEND ALL OF YOU PEOPLE TO GO FOR THIS DEVICE, IF YOU ARE DIE HARD FAN OF GAMING.
      
      BEST SMARTPHONE FOR ME..... :)
      
      
      THANKS FLIPKART FOR PROVIDING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR SHARING MY EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      AND THANKS A LOT FOR THE DEVICE, MICROMAX CANVAS 4."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,I AM REALLY HAPPY TO USE IT. ITS REALLY WORKING FINE AS I KNOW TILL NOW. AND HAVING BEST TOUCH WITH ULTIMATE LOOK.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"I AM USING THIS MOBILE &GT; 3 MONTHS, UNTILL TODAY I DIDN'T FIND ANY FLAW IN THIS MOBILE. USING VODAFONE 3G ALONG WITH IT ITS IS MARVELLOUS. MY FRIEND SAID THE VIDEO QUALITY AND PICTURE QUALITY FROM MYSIDE IS EXCELLENT AT THE TIME OF VIDEO CHAT.
      
      NEXT ONE IS AT SEVERAL TIMES I THOUGHT THAT SCRATCH MIGHT HAPPEN ON THE SCREEN DUE TO MY CARELESS. BUT NOT EVEN A SMALL SCRATCH ON THE SCREEN. GORLIILA GLASS IN THE MOBILE IS WORTH. I LIKE THE DESIGN OF THE PHONE META AT FOUR SIDES. EVERY THING IS PERFECT IN THE MOBILE.
      
      16 GB IS MORE THAN ENOUGH AND 1 GB RAM IS GOOD ENOUGH. INSTALLING ALL APPLICATIONS IN THE INTERNAL MEMORY ONLY AND MY MOBILE IS NEVER SLOW
      
      DON'T USE THE POUCH WHICH COMES ALONG WITH THE MOBILE. IT IS NOT LEATHER JUST PLASTIC AND HARMFUL TO THE MOBILE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,I AM USING THIS MOBILE SINCE LAST 5 DAYS AND REASONABLY SATISFIED. I USED MOBILE FOR ITS ACTUAL PURPOSE I.E CALL AND RECEIVE. SCREEN SIZE IS GR8 AND QUITE VISIBLE. ONE NEEDS TO CAREFUL WHILE HANDLING. IT TENDS TO SLIP OUT OF HANDS  MAINLY BECAUSE OF BEING SLIM AND BULKY AS WELL. SOUND QUALITY IS GR8. WIFI SOMETIMES ACTS FUNNY. IT GOES OFF AND COME BACK AUTOMATICALLY BUT IT DO GET ON YOUR NERVES.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST 3 MONTHS. GOOD LOOK, ALUMINIUN EGDES AND GORRILA DISPLAY KEPT MOBILE SAFE, EVEN THOUGH IT FALLS FROM HANDS ON TILE SURFACE. BEST THING IS DISPLAY. NICE RESOLUTION. HD MOVIES EXPERIENCE IS BEST.
      
      NEGATIVE THING IS THAT USE ACCESSORIES CAREFULLY, AS BACK COVER, HEADPHONE AND CHARGER CABLE ARE DELICATE.
      
      USING ONLY ONE SIM, AND BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS VERY NICE.
      
      OVERALL GOOD PHONE.."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE LAST FROM ONE MONTH.

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,I BROUGHT THIS PHONE DURING DIWALI. I BROUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY DAD. I DIDNT USE THIS MUCH BUT I ALWAYS USE TO PLAY GAMES IN THAT. SO NICE PERFORMANCE. BUT RAM NEED TO BE HIGHER FOR THIS MOBILE PHONE. BECAUSE 1GB IS NOT ENOUGH SO MICROMAX NEED TO THINK OVER IT. WHEN COMING TO CAMERA CLARITY IT IS TOO GOOD AND CLARITY IS SUPERB. WHEN COMPARING TO SAMSUNG GRAND THE CLARITY OF THIS MOBILE IS VERY GOOD. FOR BUYING SAKE I AM MENTIONING I HAVE BEEN USED BOTH THE PHONES AND THEN ONLY I AM SAYING GUYS. I GOT A CASH BACK OF 1500 IN FLIPKART SO VERY THANKS FOR THAT. AND I GOT MY PHONE WITH OUT ANY DAMAGE SO THAT THANKS FOR THE FLIPKART. WHEN COMPARING TO OUTSIDE FLIPKART GIVES LITTLE LESSER. PHONE WORKS VERY NICE NO PROBLEM IN THE PERFORMANCE. EXTERNAL COVER WHICH THEY GAVE IS NICE. THEY TRIED DIFFERENT WIRE IN CHARGING AND HEADSET. TOTALLY ITS A NICE ONE FORM MICROMAX AND THANKS FOR THE FLIPKART TO DELIVERED ME WITH OUT ANY DAMAGE. THANKS FOR ALL THE READERS.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"I DIDN'T PURCHASE IT FROM FLIPKART !! I BOUGHT THIS FROM POORVIKA MOBILE STORE WHICH IS IN TAMILNADU,CHENNAI. THIS PHONE JUSTS ROCKS !! JUST WOW WOW WOW !! CAMERA QUALITY IS AWESOME IN DAYLIGHT,BUT DOES NOT PERFORM SO GOOD IN LOWLIGHT AND NIGHT !! CAN RUN SUBWAY SURFERS,TEMPLE RUN AND MANY OTHER GAMES SMOOTHLY !! FRONT CAMERA IS ALSO GOOD !!  THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE BATTERY !! IT DRAINS A BIT FAST WHEN THE RUNNING APPS ARE NOT CLOSED !! YOU ATLEAST HAVE TO CHARGE IT 2 TIMES A DAY !! IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PHONE IN 16K JUST GO FOR IT BLINDFOLDED !! NOTHING LIKE ANYTHING !! MICROMAX ROCKS"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"I GIFTED THIS PHONE TO MY WIFE AND SHE IS LOVING IT. THE PHONE IS GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY AND I HAD NO ISSUES TILL DATE.

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"I ORDERED 2 PIECES LIKE 1 MONTH AGO AND RECEIVED THE PRODUCT WITHIN 20 HOURS.PRICE WHEN I BOUGHT:15,499 RS
      
      I AM REVIEWING THIS PRODUCT AFTER 1 MONTH BECAUSE I WANT TO USE THIS PRODUCT THOROUGHLY.
      
      
      HERE IS MY SHORT AND SWEET REVIEW :
      
      JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THE PHONE.WHAT MORE CAN WE EXPECT FOR THIS PRICE.I'M NOT ABLE TO DESCRIBE IN WORDS.
      
      
      I'VE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ONE MONTH &AMP; I'M A HEAVY USER.&AMP; YOU KNOW WHAT, IT DIDN'T HANG EVEN ONCE.I'M ABLE TO PLAY HEAVY GAMES SUCH AS NFS,REAL RACING,DEAD TRIGGER WITHOUT ANY SORT OF LAG.(GALAXY S4 LAGS LIKE CRAZY,BUT I DON'T WANT TO COMPARE WITH THAT).CAMERA IS ALSO VERY GOOD BUT DON'T COMPARE IT WITH NOKIA N8 OR GALAXY PHONES.I JUST FOUND OUT THIS HAS A SONY CAMERA SENSOR.
      
      PHONE HAS EXCELLENT AUDIO &AMP; VIDEO CLARITY.NETWORK RECEPTION IS ALSO VERY GOOD.I GET 1 DAY BATTERY BACKUP WHEN USED HEAVILY. 2G ON, USE WIFI FOR WATCHING YOUTUBE AND AROUND 2 HOURS OF GAMING &AMP; UPTO 30 MIN TALKING ON PHONE.
      
      OVERALL A GREAT BUY.
      
      PLEASE DON'T UNDERESTIMATE MICROMAX PHONES IT IS STILL A GROWING COMPANY &AMP; NEEDS TIME TO BECOME A BRAND NAME.I DO ACCEPT THE SERVICE OFFERED IS POOR BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO GO THERE AS THE PHONE IS OF GOOD BUILD.
      
      UPDATE: I BOUGTT THE THIRD PIECE TODAY! I WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT THIS PHONE.."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"I PURCHASED THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART ABOUT A MONTH AGO, AND SERIOUSLY, CANVAS 4 IS AWESOME! I JUST HAVE A LITTLE SUGGESTION, THE FLIP COVER THAT COMES WITH THE PHONE HAS METALLIC EDGES, WHICH DO A BIT OF SCRATCHING TO THE LOWER END OF THE DEVICE. REST THE PHONE IS AMAZING WITHOUT ANY COMPLAINTS. IT IS FULFILLING EVERY NEED OF MINE.
      
      AND FLIPKART, I LOVE YOUR SERVICE, DESPITE OF SNOWY WEATHER IN MY AREA, THE PHONE WAS DELIVERED IN ABOUT 3-4 DAYS. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
      
      BEST OF LUCK TO FLIPKART AND MICROMAX"

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"MANY PEOPLE MAY FIND THIS PHONE SLIGHTLY EXPENSIVE AS COMPARED TO PHONES WITH SIMILAR SPECIFICATIONS. THE EXTRA COST IS BASICALLY FOR THE GORILLA GLASS DISPLAY THE PHONE COMES WITH. IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A GORILLA GLASS DISPLAY TO BE SAFE.
      
      
      I HAVE USED THE PHONE AND IT IS PERFECT. NO ISSUES AT ALL.

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"RECENTLY I HAVE BOUGHT THIS MOBILE. THE PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY PAYS OFF TO THE COST. ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THE BATTERY PERFORMANCE OF THE MOBILE. THE BATTERY DRAINS OUT EASILY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTERNAL STORAGE AND THE PROCESSING CAPABILITIES, IT WORKS BETTER FOR THE COST. GAMES ARE WORKING FINE AND THERE N'T ANY LAGS. THE GORILLA GLASS FEATURE IS ALSO A GOOD ONE TO HAVE IN THE MOBILE. IT WILL BE A BETTER MOBILE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT A HIGH END SMART PHONE AT 15K BUDGET."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"SUPERB PHONE.. VALUE FOR MONEY.. REALLY NICE PHONE , GREAT DISPLAY, GREAT PERFORMANCE, AMAZING CAMERA CLARITY WITH 13MP, BUT BATTERY BACK IS BIT LESS OTHER THAN THAT AMAZING PHONE... I LOVE IT.."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"THE PHONE LOOKS EXCELLENT. IN THE BIG GUYS TERRITORY.
      
      WORTH THE BUY. PICKED IT UP FOR 14.5K.
      
      ANYONE SENSIBLE ENOUGH TO COMPARE THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PHONE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS PHONE CAN OFFER AT A MEAGER 14.5K THAT THE 30K PHONES DO NOT OFFER, WILL DEFINITELY BUY IT."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"THE SPEC IS ALREADY OPEN AND UN BELIVABLE WITH REFERENCE TO ITS COST!!
      
      SO JUST DROPPING A REVIEW OF THIS PHONE. THIS IS THE BEST MOBILE OF 2013. INCLUDES ALL MOST ALL THE FEATURES THAT ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE COST. I AM REALLY IMPRESSED BY ITS PERFORMANCE. BEST PLACE TO BUY IS FLIPCART. THEY GIVE BEST PROICE AND PROMPT SHIPPING. I SUGGEST YOU GUYS TO BUY THIS B4 IT GETS OUT OF STOCK."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.
      
      PROS:
      
      1. FEATURES
      
      2. PRICE
      
      3. PERFORMANCE
      
      4. CAMERA
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. I THINK PPI GREATER THAN 300 WOULD BE MUCH BETTER, BUT IS NOT A MUCH CONCERN.
      
      
      MICROMAX IS NOW TURNING INTO A MUCH BETTER BRANCH. IT IS GIVING A GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCTS. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR PAST 20 DAYS AND NO ISSUES TILL DATE.
      
      
      I WAS EARLIER SKEPTICAL TO PURCHASE MICROMAX PRODUCTS DUE TO NOT AWARE OF ITS SERVICE AND QUALITY. NOW I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS AND MAY PLAN FOR MICROMAX PRODUCTS FOR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"THIS IS A MOBILE YOU WOULD LOVE TO BUY,
      
      PROS ARE LOW COST, AND FAST PROCESSOR.
      
      THE ONLY CON IS BAD SERVICE CENTER."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE AND AS FOR ANYTHING I PURCHASE, I DID A THOROUGH RESEARCH (2 MONTHS) BEFORE I ZEROED IN ON THIS ONE. I BOUGHT THIS FOR RS. 16000 THROUGH FLIPKART, THIS WAS THE BEST DEAL AVAILABLE.
      
      
      THE PHONES THAT I HAD IN MIND WERE GALAXY S3, NEXUS 4 &AMP; 5, MICROMAX TURBO. I DID NOT THINK ABOUT SONY XPERIA BECAUSE OF ITS FORM FACTOR, THE PHONE'S QUALITY ALTHOUGH IS UNQUESTIONABLE.
      
      
      A210'S GREAT FEATURES FOR THIS PRICE RANGE FROM MY PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE:
      
      1. GOOD CAMERA BOTH FRONT FIRING AND REAR. GOOD PHOTO SHOOT OPTIONS AND I REALLY LIKE THE BURST MODE. IT IS EASY TO USE. I USE IT EXTENSIVELY FOR VIDEO CHATS THROUGH SKYPE. THE FRONT CAMERA DELIVERS ABOVE AVERAGE PICTURE QUALITY AND AS YOU KNOW THIS GREATLY DEPENDS ON YOUR NETWORK QUALITY &AMP; SPEED.
      
      2. QUAD CORE PROCESSOR MAKES THIS PHONE RUN SO FAST. BEING AN ENTHUSIASTIC FIRST TIME ANDROID USER, I HAVE INSTALLED LOADS OF APPLICATIONS, MOSTLY GAMES. THE HARDWARE IS ABLE TO HANDLE THE LOAD GIVING ME ABSOLUTELY THE SAME SPEED OF USAGE.
      
      3. EASE OF USE: MY 4 YEARS OLD SON USES THIS PHONE LIKE ANY NORMAL ADULT WHO IS A GAME ENTHUSIAST. THIS, I THINK IS A FEATURE OF ALL THE ANDROID PHONES, BUT IT WAS FASCINATING TO WATCH A 4 YEAR OLD KID NOT NEEDING ANY HELP TO LAUNCH AND PLAY GAMES. KUDOS.
      
      4. DUAL SIM: MY MAIN REQUIREMENT WAS DUAL SIM AS I AM A FREQUENT TRAVELLER AND USE A LOCAL SIM MOST OF THE TIME. THE PHONE GIVES ME AMPLE SUGGESTIONS LIKE ""WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO THROUGH LOCAL OR ROAMING"", THIS CAN BE SET. HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOUR CURRENT SET SIM IS IN ROAMING, THIS MESSAGE AUTOMATICALLY POPS UP. IT HELPS YOU MAKE DECISIONS. SIM CUSTOMIZATION IS ALSO GREAT AND SIMPLE.
      
      5. VIDEO QUALITY. I AM A BIG TIME MOVIE BUFF AND I HAVE WATCH SO MANY MOVIES IN THIS PHONE. SUPPORTS LOTS OF FILE FORMATS. AUDIO IS ON PAR AND NOTHING GREAT, BUT STILL SERVES THE PURPOSE. THE HD SCREEN MAKES THE HD MOVIES COME ALIVE IN THIS. I WAS AMAZED.
      
      
      LOADS OF OTHER FEATURES WHICH I HAVE NOT YET USED.
      
      THERE ARE NO MAJOR DOWNSIDES OF THIS PHONE WHICH IS WORTH MENTIONING HERE.
      
      
      BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A DECENT HARDWARE WITH A GOOD ANDROID VERSION WITHIN 20K BUDGET. THIS PHONE DELIVERS WHAT IT PROMISES. IT IS SLEAK, LIGHT, GRAY IS AWESOME TO LOOK AT, MANY PEOPLE HAVE TURNED THEIR HEADS TO SEE THE PHONE, IT HAS MANY CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS AND ITS EASY TO CARRY IN YOUR POCKET.
      
      ONE OF MY FRIEND RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER SEEING MINE.
      
      
      GOOD PRODUCT, GO FOR IT."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,5,"THIS IS REALLY AMAZING MOBILE MODEL. I BOUGHT WITH 16499 INR.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1) GOOD PROCESSOR
      
      2) ENOUGH RAM
      
      3) MEMORY: 42GB = 32 GB EXTERNAL + INTERNAL 10 GB
      
      4) DISPLAY : MODERATE QUALITY
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) ANDROID UI - UI COULD BE LITTLE IMPROVED LIKE ICONS (CAMERA,SETTINGS ETC) AND CONTACT MODULE UI SCREEN.
      
      2) CAMERA QUALITY NEED TO IMPROVE
      
      3) THE SCREEN GUARD WHAT THEY ATTACHED WITH COVERING IS REALLY REALLY WORST."

      NEGATIVE:- 1} I FOUND ONLY ONE NEGATIVE THING IS THAT YOU TUBE VIDEOS REQUIRES LOTS OF TIME FOR LOADING &AMP; STARTING IN THIS MOBILE. BUT I NEVER MIND FOR THIS AS I AM NOT HEAVY USER FOR YOU TUBE"

      3. DEFINITELY A VFM PHONE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"A GUD PHONE WID BETTER SCREEN N MEMORY, NICE CONFUUGERED APPS, ANDROID...LOVED IT"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"ALL OVERALL PHONE  IS GOOD BUT THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS IT GOING TO BE HANG AFTER INTERNAL MEMORY IS FULL.
      
      I HAVE TO WAIT FOR EVERY STEP..........."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"AWESOME DELIVERY BY FLIPKART, I RECEIVED THE PHONE IN 24 HRS.
      
      PHONE IS NICE IN TOUCH AND LOOKS GREAT, FOLLOWING ARE THE PROS AND CONS WHICH I FELT ABOUT THIS PRODUCT TILL NOW :
      
      
      PROS :
      
      PROCESSOR IS AWESOME, IT HAS NEVER STUCKED SOMEWHERE WHILE RUNNING ANY KIND OF GAMES OR APPLICATIOINS.
      
      VIDEO QUALITY IS VERY GOOD, ENJOYED ALOT WHILE WATCHING MOVIES. ALTHOUGH THE GIVEN VIDEO PLAYER DOESN'T SUPPORT SOME OF 720P AND MUCH MORE HIGH DEFINITION VIDEOS AND THESE VIDEOS CAN BE PLAYED BY DOWNLOADING APPS (KM PLAYER).
      
      FRONT CAMERA IS GOOD, BUT REAR (PRIMARY) CAMERA IS NOT AS GOOD AS EXPECTED AS ITS 13MP. MMX SHOULD IMPROVE ON IT AND SHOULD INCREASE MP ONLY AFTER REALLY ENHANCING THE CAMERA QUALITY.
      
      GORILLA GLASSES MAKES YOU FEEL RELAX AS ITS VERY HARD TO MAKE SCRATCH ON THE SCREEN, YOU COULD ALSO SEARCH VIDEO FOR THIS ON YOUTUBE.
      
      SOME BUYERS WROTE ABOUT LOW SOUND BUT I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING LIKE THAT ITS LOUD ENOUGH WITH EARPHONES AND WITHOUT.
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY HAS BEEN GIVEN 16GB THAT IS REALLY GOOD BECAUSE INTERNAL MEMORY WORKS MORE FASTER AS COMPARED TO EXTERNAL MEMORY EVEN OF HIGH QUALITY MEMORY CARDS.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      NOT SATISFIED WITH 13MP CAMERA, IT COULD BE THE BEST PHONE IF CAMERA QUALITY COULD REALLY ENHANCED THEN IT COULD EVEN BEAT PHONES OF RANGE 22000 - 25000.
      
      NEVER USE TRANSPARENT FLIP COVER IT MAKES SCRATCHES WITHIN 2-3 DAYS.
      
      BATTERY DURATION IS A LITTLE SHORTER BUT CAN BE MANAGED EASILY.
      
      
      OVERALL, ITS A GOOD ANDROID PHONE ENJOYING ALOT ! ! !"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,BEEN USING IT FOR SOME TIME.. WORKS GOOD. VALUE FOR MONEY. LOOKS GOOD DUE TO ALUMINIUM BODY.  MICROMAX HAS TO WORK ON THEIR AFTER SALES NETWORK.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"BETTER MOBILE AT GIVEN PRICE POINT.GOOD ONE FROM INDIAN START-UP MICROMAX.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. GOOD PROCESSOR,RAM AND INTERNAL MEMORY.
      
      2. NICE DISPLAY.
      
      3. SMOOTH TOUCH INTERFACE AND GOOD DESIGN.
      
      4. PHONE NEVER LAGGED WHILE MULTI TASKING.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. AUDIO QUALITY FOR CONVERSATIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE BETTER. BUT SIGNAL RECEPTION IS GOOD.
      
      2. PRIMARY CAMERA IS NOT UPTO 13MP IMAGE CAPTURING CAPABILITY.THERE IS NOISE FOR CAPTURED IMAGES.SECONDARY CAM IS GOOD.HD QUALITY VIDEOS ARE GOOD.
      
      
      DELIVERY AND PACKAGING QUALITY BY FLIPKART IS GOOD AS USUAL.
      
      OVERALL FEEDBACK, WORTH FOR SPENT MONEY, IN CASE GOOD CAMERA IS NOT THE PRIMARY REQUIREMENT."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,CANVAS 4 IS A DECENT PHONE. THE FEATURES OFFERED FOR THE PRICE ARE GOOD. BUT THE CAMERA IS A SETBACK. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS MEDIOCRE.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"COMPARED TO MICROMAX CANVAS 2 THIS PHONE LOOKS VERY SMALL,SOMETIME I FELT THIS IS A 4 INCH PHONE...PLS DON'T BUY THIS PHONE IF U R A BIGSCREEN SMARTPHONE LOVER,XOLO Q2000 IS BETTER OPTION THAN THIS PHONE...LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED,2G INTERNET SPEED IS VERY SLOW....NO HANGS YET,CAMERA QUALITY IS WORST,NOT ABLE TO CAPTURE PHOTOS DURING NIGHT,MY SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2'S 8 MP CAMERA IS BETTER THAN THIS..."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"DESIGNING IS GOOD
      
      SO FAR ITS WORKING GOOD.
      
      NO PROBLEM AT ALL.
      
      GOOD FOR THE PRICE PAID.
      
      
      DELIVERY WAS QUICKER THAN EXPECTED.
      
      THANKS FLIPKART."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PHONE IS GOOD .. THE RESOLUTION COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WHEN COMPARED TO CANVAS HD.. BUT ITS WORTH THE PRICE WITH THE CAMERA(13 MP 5MP), GORILLA GLASS, THE METAL FRAME. THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I FACED WAS THE FLIP COVER AS IT IS MADE UP OF FIBER WHICH WILL SCRATCH THE SCREEN. I WOULD SUGGEST TO GO FOR MICROMAX TURBO AS THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE PRICE. MICROMAX PROVIDES MANY FEATURES IN LESS PRICE COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,EVERYTHING IS GOOD UNTIL NOW.. EXCEPT THE COVER..DO NOT USE THE COVER.. IT PUTS SCRATCHES ON YOUR SCREEN GUARD
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"FAST DELIVERY AND CHEAP WHEN COMPARE TO OTHER SHOPPING SITES... USING THIS ITEM FOR PAST 1 MONTH... SINCE BOUGHT, NO ISSUES FOUND AND NO LAGS WHILE USING THE MOBILE... THE COVER WITH THIS PRODUCT MAKING WORSE, PUTTING SCRATCHES..."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"FIRST ALL, WHEN I PLANNED TO BUY A SMARTPHONE, I WAS STUCK BETWEEN SAMSUNG GRAND &AMP; MICROMAX A 210. THEN FINALLY DECIDED TO GO WITH MICROMAX;
      
      THE MAIN CONS I FOUND IN THIS PHONE IS THE BATTERY BACK UP... ITS BAD. I AM A NORMAL USER AND NOT AN INTERNET OR GAMES FREAK.... BUT STILL, I FOUND THE BATTERY DRAINS OUT TO 60% BY 8-10 HRS.
      
      THAT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT.
      
      PROS: THE BEST BUILT PHONE IN THE RECENT PAST... LOOKS SOLID.... FEATURES ARE MIND LURING AS WELL. BUT THE CAMERA 13 MEGAPIXEL DOES NOT IMPRESS ME THAT MUCH!
      
      OVERALL AN AVERAGE PHONE AND FLIPKART PROVIDES AT THE LOWEST PRICE EVEN AT 6-9 MNTHS EMI..."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"FLIP-KART SERVICE IS AWESOME LIKE ALWAYS.
      
      
      PHONE IS VERY GOOD FOR THE PRICE RANGE GIVE IT 5/5 , BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO USE COMPASS FEATURE AS THIS PHONE WILL NEVER SUPPORT COMPASS APPLICATIONS AS THERE IS NO MAGNETIC SENSOR!! THAT'S THE ONLY DEFECT WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      ITS BETTER TO BUY CANVAS TURBO.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE - 5/5
      
      STYLE - 5/5
      
      OVERALL - 4.5 / 5"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"FOR ALL I HAVE READ ABOUT MICROMAX, I WAS A BIT APPREHENSIVE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT, BUT AFTER USING IT FOR ALMOST 4 MONTHS NOW, I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS.  THERE IS THE OCCASIONAL HANGUP AND OTHER SMALL DEFECTS, BUT THE PROS OVERRIDE IT ALL.  I AM NOT GOING TO GO IN FOR A VERY TECHNICAL REVIEW, CAUSE I AIN'T GOOD AT THAT STUFF, BUT FROM A LAYMAN'S PERSPECTIVE, THIS IS ONE GOOD UNDER 20 K PHONE TO BUY.
      
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS QUITE GOOD, THE UI IS GREAT, SOUND COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.  THE MAIN DRAWBACK IS THE STUPID COVER THEY GIVE YOU WITH THE PHONE.  IT SCRATCHES THE SCREEN REAL BAD, BUT I ESCAPED SINCE I HAD A SCREEN GUARD."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"GOOD HANDSET FROM MICROMAX. IT IS WORTH TO BUY THIS PRODUCT,AS IT HAS ALL THE FEATURE WHICH ONE COULD THINK AND THAT TO AT A REASONABLE PRICE.
      
      BUT THE QUALITY OF COVER CASE PROVIDED BY MICROMAX IS NOT GOOD BCZ IT CREATES SCRACHES ON THE SCREEN."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"GOOD LOOKING AND STURDY HAND SET. HAVE BEEN USING FOR PAST ONE MONTH. HAVE DROPPED 2-3 TIMES. NO ISSUES TILL NOW. PRETTY FAST BROWSING THROUGH THE PHONE. CAMERA FRONT AND REAR ARE GOOD. GAMING IS EXCELLENT. VIDEOS ARE SUPERB. OTG IS VERY USEFULL AS PEN DRIVES CAN BE USED. BATTERY IS GOOD FOR A DAY. I DO GOOD AMOUNT OF BROWSING AND GAMMING. USE OF MY LAPTOP HAS GONE DOWN.
      
      
      CONS
      
      NOISE IN LOW LIGHT PICTURES
      
      SLIGHT DELAY TO FOCUS AND CLICK PHOTO
      
      FLIPCOVER THEY GIVE IS USE LESS."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,GOOD PHONE . NO LAGGING AT ALL . ONLY ONE DRAWBACK THE VOLUME KEY EVEN WHEN PHONE IS LOCKED CHANGES THE PROFILE FROM VIBRATING TO SILENT OR GENERAL
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"GOOD PRODUCT IN USING AND GOOD SERVICE BY FLIPKART , I HAVE PURCHASED MANY ITEMS FROM FLIPKART AND ALWAYS ITS GOOD IN TIME OF DELIVERY"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,GREAT PHONE TO HAVE. I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND AND NOW I AM THIKING WHETHER I SHOULD GIVE HIM OR NOT...
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"GUYS,
      
      WHOEVER IS PLANNING FOR THE LOWEST BUDGET AND HIGHEST BUILT IN MEMORY.
      
      CAN GO FOR THE MICROMAX A210 C-4.
      
      STUNNING CLEARITY WITH VIDEOS ..WITHOUT BUFFERING YOUTUBE VIDOES, ULTIMATE TOUCH RESPONSE.
      
      INCREDIBLE DESIGN, BATTERY BACK UP ALSO GOOD.
      
      VERY BEST IN PERFORAMNCE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,HANDSET IS VERY GOOD. CAMERA AND PROCESSOR IS VERY GOOD. HOWEVER FLIP COVER IS NOT AS PER EXPECTATION AND CREATES MANY SCRATCHES ON SCREEN.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"HERE R SOME OF THE PROS AND CONS..
      
      FIRST OF ALL, THE MUSIC APP IS CRAP...
      
      THE HARDWARE SUPORT IS GREAT..
      
      BATTERY LIFE, AS U EXPECT, IS LOW COZ OF 2000 MAH..
      
      TOUCH IS SO SO RESPONSIVE..
      
      DISPLAY...AHH..AWESOME!
      
      'LOOK AWAY TO PAUSE' IS JUST A GIMMICK AND WORKS SOMETIMES..
      
      HOWEVER.. I GIVE 4 STARS BECOZ AT DIS BUDGET .. ITS BETTER DEN ITS COMPETITIORS..
      
      HAIL YE..
      
      ND HELL YES..!!"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"HI,
      
      
      THIS MOBILE IS VERY GOOD, BECAUSE OF MY FAULT THE DISPLAY GOT DAMAGED. I WENT TO SERVICE CENTER THEY SAID IT WILL BE FIXED IN 7 DAYS. AS PER THE SCHEDULE, I GOT A MESSAGE THAT MY MOBILE HAS BEEN FIXED ON 7TH DAY. SO ON 8TH DAY I WENT TO SERVICE CENTER, THEY SAID SPARE CAME FROM HEAD OFFICE THEY NEED TO FIX IT, SO I WENT ON 9TH DAY THEN THEY SAID WE DONT HAVE SPARE WITH US. AFTER SO MUCH TALKING THEY FIXED IT IN 1 HOUR.
      
      
      POINTS TO BE NOTED:
      
      1) SERVICE IS VERY BAD
      
      2) U WILL FIND ATLEAST 50-60 PEOPLE COMING TO MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER DAILY
      
      3) IN THAT 50-60 90% PEOPLE WONT GET PROPER SERVICE AND YOU WILL FIND PEOPLE YELLING AND QUARELLING IN MMX SERVICE CENTERS.
      
      4) MICROMAS TOLL FREE NUMBER ALWAYS BUSY, SERVICE CENTER NUMBER THEY WONT ANSWER THE CALL.
      
      5) IF YOU CHCEK IN GOOGLE, YOU CAN FIND LOTS OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST MMX SERVICE CENTERS.
      
      
      CONCLUSION:
      
      ITS A GOOD MOBILE, BUT IF U HAVE ANY ISSUES, BETTER YOU BUY ANOTHER MOBILE, THE SERVICE IS VERY BAD NO WORST. MMX NEEDS TO IMPROVE THEIR SERVICE AND SERVICE CENTERS. SO IF YOU THINK YOU CAN KEEP THIS MOBILE SAFELY AND USE IT GENTLY THEN BUY IT OTHERWISE DONT BUY IT, NOT BCOZ OF BRAND BCOZ OF SERVICE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"HII FRIENDS.. ITS BEEN OVER A MONTH NOW SINCE I GOT A PROMPT DELIVERY OF MY MICROMAX CANVAS 4. THANK U GUYS AT FLIPKART, LOVED THE BUBBLE PACK. AND YES..

THE CORNING GORILLA GLASS MAKES ME WORRY LESS ABOUT MY FONE GETTING A SCRATCH.. THANK U MICROMAX. U PPL HAVE INDEED COME A LONG WAY.. DEFINITELY UP AGAINST THE MOBILE GIANTS LIKE SAMSUNG OR NOKIA.. KEEP IT UP.. HI 5!!!"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST 20 DAYS AND TILL NOW FOUND IT AMAZING... THE CAMERA QUALITY AND RESOLUTION ARE EXCELLENT..  HIGH RESOLUTION GRAPHICS GAMES RUNS SMOOTHLY COZ OF16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND 1 GB RAM ..NO COMPLAINTS TILL NOW :) :)  REALLY MICROMAX ROCKS!!
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"I AM USING THIS PHONE SINCE ONE MONTH, ITS AWEEESOMMMEE...ONLY ONE THING CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD WHICH SUPPOSED TO BE FOR 13MP."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"I BOUGHT THE PHONE BEFORE 20 DAYS .., ITS A GOOD PHONE.,  BUT THE CAMERA DOES NOT LOOK LIKE 13MP.., AND LOUDSPEAKER GOES ON AUTOMATICALLY .., OTHERS LIKE THE PROCESSOR AND SOUND QUALITY ARE GOOD ..,"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"I GOT MICROMAX CANVAS 4 BEFORE ONE MONTH,GOOD JOB BY FLIPKART, IT IS NICE MOBILE,CAMERA CLARITY IS GOOD.I AM REALLY ENJOY WITH THIS."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"I HAD BEEN PURCHASING EXPENSIVE MOBILES IN THE PAST LIKE SONY P1I, BLACKBERRY BOLD. MOTOROLA.... THESE MOBILES WERE ONE OF THE BEST IN THEIR TIME.. BUT SOON BECAME OUTDATED WITH RATE THE MOBILE PHONES HAVE BEEN IMPROVING. SPENDING LOT OF MONEY ON MOBILE PHONES JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. THOUGH  I WANTED A HD MOBILE WITH LARGE SCREEN AND ADVANCED FEATURES... I DECIDED TO GO IN FOR THE CANVAS 4.
      
      I WAS A BIT SKEPTIC IN THE BEGINNING.... BUT AFTER USING IT FOR 2-3 MONTHS I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY DECISION. THE SCREEN IS EXCELLENT. NO ISSUES WITH NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. SOMETIMES THERE IS A NETWORK DROP WHEN THE 3G NETWORK IS WEAK AND THE MOBILE TRIES TO SHIFT TO EDGE. SO I HAVE SWITCHED OFF THE 3G IN THE MOBILE AND USE EDGE.  WHEN I NEED 3G .. I JUST CHANGE IT IN THE SETTINGS.
      
      THERE SURELY IS SOME ISSUE WITH THE WIFI NETWORK DETECTION !! YOU NEED BE CLOSE TO THE WIFI ROUTER...15  FEETS IN A OPEN ROOM. IF U ARE IN THE NEXT ROOM THE WIFI WEAK OR U'LL NEVER CONNECT TO IT..... MY OLDER PHONE WERE MUCH BETTER IN THAT MATTER.  SECONDLY IT U HAVE A WEAK ROUTER THEN I GUESS U NEED TO SIT SOMEWHERE 4-5 FEET CLOSE....
      
      
      I GOT IT FOR 14K FROM FLIPKART.... AS THERE WAS 15% CASHBACK OFFER .. + I GOT SOME FREE GIFTS .BLUETOOTH HANDS FREE AND A TRAVEL CHARGER....
      
      
      FLIPKART DISPATCHED T THE PRODUCT THE NEXT DAY , BUT I RECEIVED IN 10 DAYS !! HAD TO KEEP CALLING THE COURIER SERVICE !!"

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"I HAVE USED BOTH GRAND DUOS AND CANVAS 4
      
      IN TERMS OF LOOKS, CANVAS 4 IS FAR BETTER THEN GRAND DUOS COZ OF METALLIC BODY.
      
      CANVAS 4 IS QUAD CORE WHILE GRAND IS DUAL CORE.
      
      CANVAS 4 IS CHEAPER THEN GRAND DUOS, QUATTRO HAVING SIMILAR SPECS.
      
      
      VERDICT - GO FOR IT GUYS. ITS CHEAPER IN TERMS OF PRICE AND OFFERS DECENT SPECS."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"I JUST ONLY GOT THIS FROM FLIPKART. I THINK THIS IS THE BEST PHONE YOU CAN GET UNDER 20K.....
      
      THE 1.2GHZ PROCESSOR, 1GB RAM, GELLY BEAN 4.2.1 ,,ETC GIVES EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE....
      
      THE GAMING GRAPHICS AND FULL HD RECORDING  MAKES IT MUCH BETTER..
      
      BUT THE CONS THAT I FOUND ARE  THE BLOW TO UNLOCK FEATURE STOPPED RUNNING JUST WITHIN 1 DAY OF USE...  THE PHONE NEEDS FREQUENT CHARGING  DUE ITS 2000MAH BATTERY..... THE 13 MP CAMERA IS NOT UP TO THE MARK.....
      
      IF YOU ARE EXPECTING MUCH MORE FEATURES SPENT SOME MORE BUCKS AND GET NEXUS 4..."

      CONSIDERING ALL THE FACTORS VIZ. DISPLAY, CHIPSET, RAM, CAMERA, BUILD QUALITY, SERVICE, VARIOUS BENCHMARK VALUES AND OTHER FACTORS; THIS PRODUCT IS BALANCED IN ALL WAYS. NEITHER THE BEST IN ONE OR WORST IN ONE.
      
      
      IF ONE NEEDS AN ALL-ROUND BALANCED MOBILE IN THIS PRICE RANGE AND IS NOT BOTHERED ABOUT BRAND, I WOULD SUGGEST THIS.

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"I ORDERED THIS PHONE IN OFFER FROM FLIP KART AND RECEIVED THIS ORDER IN 2 WORKING DAYS.

(STAND BY TIME AS MENTIONED IS 220 HOURS BY COMPANY).
      
      
      CLICKED FEW SNAPS AND I LIKED THE OUTPUT. I THINK THE PRICE AT WHICH FLIP KART IS SELLING IS ALSO VERY LESS AS COMPARE TO MARKET. THE GRAPHICS ARE GOOD ALONG WITH MICROMAX OWN STORE.
      
      
      THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD (NOT AS AWESOME AS COMPARE TO SONY CELLS) BUT STILL THEY ARE PRETTY GOOD.

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"POSITIVES***
      
      *PREMIUM LOOK AND FEEL. WOW
      
      *AMAZING DISPLAY CLARITY. NEVER EXPECTED THIS MUCH.
      
      *NO LAG. EVEN WITH MULTIPLE APPS IN THE BACKGROUND, IT WORKS VERY SMOOTHLY.
      
      *GOOD USER INTERFACE. VERY USER FRIENDLY.
      
      *SO SLIM. EVEN THOUGH ITS A LARGE PHONE WITH A 5"" DISPLAY, ITS THIN BODY MAKES IT VERY CONVENIENT TO CARRY IN POCKETS
      
      *PRETTY GOOD FRONT CAMERA.
      
      *DECENT LOUD SPEAKER.
      
      
      NEGATIVES***
      
      *POOR BATTERY. THE BATTERY IS NOT AT ALL UPTO THE MARK FOR THIS PHONE. IT DRAINS VERY QUICKLY WITH THE INTERNET USAGE/GAMES. EVEN WITH THE SINGLE SIM USAGE I FOUND IT HARDLY SURVIVES 12HRS. YOU MUST REDUCE THE USAGE OF INTERNET TO SAVE THE CHARGE.
      
      THINKING ABOUT BUYING A BATTERY BANK.
      
      *POOR WIFI. WIFI SIGNAL IS BELOW AVERAGE. HAVE TO BE NEAR TO THE WIFI ROUTER OR ELSE VERY VERY POOR WIFI RANGE.
      
      *13MP REAR CAMERA IS NOT UPTO THE MARK. I THINK MY 8MP NOKIA N86 IS LIL BETTER. ANYWAYS ITS A DECENT CAMERA.
      
      *HANGOUT IS LIL BUGGY AND SOMETIMES THE BROWSER ALSO. BUT STILL ITS NOT VERY ANNOYING.
      
      
      I'M A HAPPY COSTUMER :)"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"PROS -
      
      &GT; LOOKS GOOD.
      
      &GT; LARGER INTERNAL MEMORY
      
      &GT; INBUILT FLIP COVER COMES ALONG BOX
      
      
      CONS -
      
      &GT; SAME PERFORMANCE SPECS AS A116
      
      &GT; SAME BATTERY - BACKUP IS JUST ABOUT 1 DAY FOR NORMAL USERS WITHOUT VIDEO PLAYING OR GAMES"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING WORKS FINE WITH MY LOVELY DIWALI CASBACK OFFER CANVAS 4 SMARTPHONE WITHOUT ANY ISSUES. DIDNOT NOTICE BATTERY USAGE IN PARTICULAR BUT A BIT LOW COMPARED TO THIS RANGE FEATURES SMARTPHONE. FLIP COVER PROVIDED ALONG WITH PHONE PACKAGE WAS EXCELLENT AT LOOKS BUT WORST IN USAGE AS THAT INTURN GIVES SCRATCHES TO SCREENGUARD WHEN KEPT IN POCKETS (TRIED CHANGING SCREENGUARD IT REPEATED HENCE REMOVE FLIP.. :) )
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"SUPERB MOBILE WITH THIS PRICE RANGE, BUT I HAVE FEW CONS ARE
      
      1) SECONDARY CAMERA IS NOT MUCH GOOD, EVEN IT IS 13 MP BUT ITS NOT CAPTURING TO THE EXTENT.  MICROMAX SHOULD WORK ON THE CAMERA SOFTWARE INSTEAD OF JUST INCREASING THE MP.
      
      2) THE FLIP COVER IS TOO BAD, DON'T PUT THIS FLIP COVER WITHOUT SCREEN GUARD, IN 3 DAYS MANY SCRATCHES CAME ON THE MOBILE, THANK GOD THAT I HAD PUT SCREEN GUARD ON IT. NOW I HAVE REMOVED THAT FLIP GUARD GIVEN BY MICROMAX."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"THE CAMERA 13 MP IS NOT AS IT IS.THE PICTURES RESEMBLE TO BE 5MP. BUT EXCEPT CAMERA, THE PHONE IS VERY GOOD FOR BROWSING,SPEED AND ALL OTHER FEATURES. AUDIO IS ALSO GOOD.YOU SHOULD BUY THIS PHONE WHEN THERE ARE SOME OFFERS GOING ON. GOOD WHEN BOUGHT FOR 14K.THE PHONE FEAURES ARE SIMILAR TO THAT OF GALAXY S4. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PHONE WITH ALL FEATURES AND LESS PRICE, THIS IS THE BEST OPTION"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,THE PERFORMANCE IS GOOD. BUT QUITE WEAK IN CATCHING SIGNAL STRENGTH OF WIFI. SOME TIMES RARELY SWITCHES OFF SUDDENLY
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"THE PHONE IS REALLY COOL. I AM ENJOYING EVERY BIT OF IT. I AM HAPPY THAT I MADE RIGHT CHOICE. I AM GREATFULL TO FLIPKART TOO, FOR DELIVERING THE PRODUCT ON TIME. HOWEVER I HAVE TO MENTION ONE THING, I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE FLIP COVER THATS BEEN GIVEN IN THE BOX. ITS MAKING MORE SCRATCHES RATHER THAN PROTECTING THE SCREEN. ELSE EVERYTHING IS SIMPLY AWESOME."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"THE PRICES OF C4 HAVE GONE DOWN. REALLY REDUCED BY 4K. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY C4 IS D BEST MMX PHON TILL NOW. AND BEST PHON IN THIS RANGE. I WAS REALLY WORRIED WEDR PHON WILL BE GOOD OR NOT. WAS CONFUSED BW GREY AND WHITE. BT FINALLY GT GREY. FELL IN LOVE WID D GREY ONE AS SOON I OPENED D PHON. D SCREENS LOWEST BRIGHTNESS IS MORE THAN 50% BRIGHTNESS OF XPERIA SL THAT I OWN. COLOUR PRODUCTION IS BETTER THAN XPERIA SL. AS I HAV BOTH SONY AND MMX SO I KNOW THE DIFFERENC. PEPL MAY SAY ITS NT GUD AS IT MMX BT DO BELIEV ME IT WONT LET YOU DOWN. BUILD QUALITY IS EXCELLENT MUCH BETTER DAN TURBO, MAGNUS, HD OR ANY ODER MMX PHON. GORILLA GLASS SIMPLY IS AMAZING. BEATS NEXUS 4. IN THIS PRIC U CANT GET ANY ODR PHON BETR THAN THIS.
      
      
      NOW THE NEGATIV POINTS. BATTERY BACKUP IS NOT GOOD. WITH 2G NET AND DOWNLOADING IT LASTS FOR ABOUT 10-12 HRS. IF I DONT USE NET DN IT LASTS FOR ABOUT 2 DAYS. MAGNETIC SENSOR COULD HAV BN PROVIDED. IM GIVING 4 STARS BECAUS OF THIS REASON ODRWISE IT DESERVS 5 STARS. AND CAMERA IN LOW LIGHT IS NOT GOOD AT ALL ODERWIS ITS EXCELLENT, STANDS OUT IN ALL. BEING A STUDENT THIS IS SIMPLY BEST FOR MY USAGE WICH INVOLVS LOTS OF EXPERIMENTATION AND ROUGH USAGE.
      
      
      DONT LISN TO ODERS WHO THINK UR FOOL TO BUY MMX. ITS WAY BETTER DAN GRAND AND GRAND 2 AND XPERIA C. YES ONETHING I DO FEAR IS PERFORMANC IN D LONG RUN. HOW LONG THIS PHON PERFORMS WELL, I DONNO. AND WITH MMX POOR SERVIC CENTRS I DO FEAR DES THGS A LOT. HOWEVER DES RISKS I TUK WILLINGLY. I DONT THINK DEY SHOULD TROUBLE ME MUCH....MY SUGGESTION- GO FOR IT.
      
      TURBO IS NT GOOD WID FIXD STORAGE AND MICRO SIM. MAGNUS IS GREAT BUT POOR CAMERA AND LOW INTERNAL MEMORY. C4 LOOKS GREAT AND HAS GORILLA GLASS.....SO CHOSE FOR URSLF"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"THE WIFI RANGE OF THIS MOBILE IS VERY POOR... IT EVEN GIVES ONLY 2-3 SIGNALS IN THE SAME ROOM
      
      OTHERWISE PHONE WILL BEAT ALL OTHER PRODUCTS VERY FAR"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,THIS DEVICE HAVING GREAT FEATURE AND AS AN ANDROID DEVLOPER I AM VERY MUCH HAPPY WITH ITS FEATURE AND COST :)
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE ORDERED SOMETHING THIS COSTLY VIA INTERNET AND THANK GOD I PREFERRED FLIPKART. IT'S DIWALI TIME AND STILL THEY SHIPPED THE PRODUCT WITHIN DAYS!! I ORDERED IT ON 1ST OF NOV(LATE NIGHT), AND ON 4TH NOV(DIWALI DAY) I GOT MY PRODUCT!! IT'S REALLY GREAT. BECAUSE I WASN'T EXPECTING IT TO BE SO QUICK AS PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED FROM DELHI AND I LIVE IN SURAT. THANKS A LOT FLIPKART. I'LL SHOP AGAIN. :)
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PHONE:
      
      I GUESS THOSE READING REVIEWS ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THE FEATURES,PROS AND CONS OF THIS DEVICE SO I'LL NOT GET INTO THAT.
      
      I USED IT FOR A DAY AND THIS IS WHAT MY INITIAL EXPERIENCE IS:
      
      SCREEN RESOLUTION IS GREAT. WORKS FLOWLESSLY. PLAYED ASPHALT 8 2/3 TIMES. SPEED IS SLOW BUT IT DIDN'T LAG. CAMERA NOT SO SHARP.:/ 13 MP IS NOT NEAR TO 5 MP OF SAMSUNG GRAND QUATTRO OR XPERIA NEO L. STILL WORKS GREAT WHEN THERE'S SUFFICIENT LIGHT IN THE ROOM. ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF THE CAM ARE GREAT. ABOUT THE GUI,WELL I MISS XPERIA KEYBOARD AS THE DEFAULT ANDROID KEYBOARD DOESN'T LEARN WORDS. OTHER STUFF IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME.
      
      THE MAIN CONCERN IS BATTERY. IT CONSUMES A LOT OF BATTERY AND IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO FULLY CHARGE THE DEVICE. MY PREVIOUS SMARTPHONE WAS XPERIA TIPO WHICH WAS A SONY PRODUCT AND IT ONLY HAD 3.5 "" SCREEN SO I CAN'T DIRECTLY COMPARE CANVAS 4 WITH IT BUT STILL IT TAKES ""SOME"" TIME TO CHARGE.
      
      
      FINAL WORDS:
      
      BEFORE PLACING THE ORDER,I HAD AN IN-DEPTH CONVERSATION WITH ONE THE MMX CUSTOMER CARE REPRESENTATIVE. AND HE ENSURED ME THAT MMX ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO IMPROVE THEIR CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE BUT IT CAN'T BE DONE OVER-NIGHT. IT'LL TAKE TIME AND FOR LATEST CANVAS SERIES PHONES(DOODLE 2,CANVAS 4 , MAGNUS, TURBO) THEY HAVE A 7 DAY REPLACEMENT POLICY IN WHICH IF THERE'S SOME PROBLEM IN THE DEVICE IN FIRST 7 DAYS,THEY'LL REPLACE THE DEVICE. AND DURING WARRANTY PERIOD,THEY'LL TREAT THIS FOUR PHONES DIFFERENTLY.
      
      FLIPKART IS GIVING 1500 RS CASHBACK ON THIS PHONE ATM,SO FOR 16K,THIS PHONE IS THE BEST YOU'LL GET IN THE MARKET(EXCLUDE XOLO AND OTHER COMPANIES)
      
      EVEN CANVAS HD COSTS 14.5K,THEN IF YOU JUST ADD 1.5K,YOU GET AN IMPROVED VERSION OF CANVAS HD IE CANVAS 4.
      
      I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE AND INDIAN COMPANY GROW GLOBALLY. AND WHEN THEY'RE TRYING,THIS IS MY LITTLE CONTRIBUTION. :)"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"VALUE FOR MONEY! I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FROM LAST THREE MONTHS AND NO ISSUES SO FAR. GORRILA GLASS, DISPLAY AND PERFORMANCE VERY GOOD. BATTERY GOES EASILY FOR ONE DAY."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,VERY GOOD PRODUCT FROM MICRO MAX TO BEAT THE OTHER COMPETITORS.THE ONLY THING I AM NOT SATISFIED IS THE TRANSPARENT POUCH GIVEN WITH IT WHICH LEAVES SCRATCHES ON THE SCREEN IF IT IS USED.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"WELL AFTER A LOT OF R&AMP;D I BOUGHT THIS PHONE, SERVICE FROM FLIPKART WAS OK, PHONE WORKS GREAT, I WOULD SAY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PHONE IN THIS RANGE. ON A FIRST GLANCE BUILD QUALITY WAS OUTSTANDING, BUT AFTER USING IT FOR MORE THAN 1 MONTH NOW, I AM FACING AN ISSUE WITH THE EAR-PIECE OF THIS DEVICE, WELL IT LOOKS AS IF IT IS LOOSING ITS ""COLOR"", YUP ITS CHANGING FROM SILVER COLOR TO BROWN, PROBABLY RUST OR SOMETHING. APART FROM THAT PAR THE DEVICE IS GREAT.
      
      ALTHOUGH IF THEIR IS A SOLUTION FOR EAR-PIECE I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT, AS I AM NOT WILLING TO HAND OVER MY DEVICE TO SERVICE CENTER."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,4,"WORTH BUYING FOR THIS PRICE! GOOD OFFER BY FLIPKART! PHONE SPECIFICATIONS AND CLARITY AND INTERNAL MEMORY , RAM ALL ARE GOOD!"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"@ FLIPKART : GREAT SERVICE.. THE THREE STAR RATING THAT I HAVE GIVEN IS DUE TO YOUR GREAT SERVICE STANDARDS!!
      
      
      @MICROMAX : YOU CAME OUT WITH A PHONE LOADED WITH UMPTEEN FEATURES!! BUT UNFORTUNATELY, YOU COMPROMISED DRASTICALLY ON BATTER"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"2 DAYS BACK I HAVE BOUGHT A MICROMAX A210 (CANVAS 4) AND VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FLIP COVER WHICH YOU HAVE PROVIDED WITH THE BUNDLE. THE USAGE OF FLIP COVER CAUSED HEAVY SCRATCHES ON MY PHONE'S SCREEN AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE I HAVE PAID A HUGE AMOUNT FOR BUYING THIS GREAT SMARTPHONE.
      
      
      EXCEPT THE FLIP COVER PROBLEM, I AM VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED PRODUCT.
      
      
      IT WOULD BE GREAT, IF MICROMAX CAN REPLACE THE FLIP COVER ALONG WITH A GOOD SCREEN CARD."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"BOUGHT CANVAS 4 RECENTLY, 1 DAY AGO ! AND, HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE .. !
      
      WORST BATTERY BACKUP ! GETS DISCHARGED AFTER A SMALL USE ..
      
      CAMERA NOT GOOD AS IT HAS TO BE (13 MP) !
      
      THERMAL WARNING !
      
      NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE ! AND, COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED !!"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"CAMERA IS NOT GOOD...
      
      DISPLAY AND SCREEN  IS ASWM,,,,
      
      PHONE PERFOMANCE IS GOOD...
      
      BUT THE TAG MICROMAX AND IS SERVICE IS BOGUS.."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"CANVAS 2.2 IS FASTER AND BETTER THAN CANVAS 4, RAM GETS FILLED UP QUICKLY, GAMES ARE GETTING STUCK SOMETIMES."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"CURRENTLY I AM USING MICROMAX A90S AND I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE. THERE IS SO MANY PROBLEMS AND FIRST OF THEM IS AFTER SALES SERVICES. EVEN PRICE WAS 12490/- WHEN I PURCHASED (15-JAN-13) WITH SPECIFICATION 1GHZ DUAL CORE, 4"" DISPLAY, 512 MB RAM AND 1600 MAH BATTERY. AND  FEW DAYS(FEB-13) AFTER MMX LAUNCHES CAN HD 1.2GHZ QUAD CORE, 5"" DISPLAY, 1GB RAM WITH 2000 MAH BATTERY AT PRICED 13900/-
      
      HIGHLY CHANGED ITS CONFIGURATIONS WITH MINIMAL CHANGE OF ITS PRICE. NOTE IT PLEASE. MIN CHANGE IN PRICE ( MAX 1500/-)
      
      NOW COMPARE SPECIFICATION OF CAN HD AND CAN4 ALMOST SAME ONLY CAMERA IS CHANGE 8 MP TO 13 MP AND 2MP TO 5MP REAR AND FRONT RESPECTIVELY. OTHER THINGS ARE ALMOST SAME..
      
      YA SOME SOFTWARE GIMMICKS ARE ADDED COPIED FROM GALAXY S4 AND HTC. BUT NOT IN FULL
      
      LIKE IN GALAXY S4 RETINA SENSOR FOR NOT ONLY USED FOR START/STOP VIDEO BUT THERE IS USED FOR SCROLL THE TEXT ALSO...
      
      SO SOFTWARE GIMMICKS NOT SO ATTRACTIVE. BUT PRICE IS TOO HIGH. (DIFFERENCE IS 4000/-  BETWEEN HD AND 4)
      
      SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE AROUND 15000/-
      
      AND MMX MUST IMPROVE AFTER SALES SERVICE. AND FINALLY I WISH IT SHOULD NOT BE LIKE A90S
      
      HOPE OUR INDIAN COMPANY GROW IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET WITH BEST PRODUCT AND BEST SERVICE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"FLIPKART SERVICE AS USUAL ROCKS.
      
      PHONE IS GOOD BUT CAMERA QUALITY WHICH THEY CLAIM AS 13 MEGA PIXEL DOESN'T SEEMS TO BE THAT GREAT. IF ANYBODY WANTS GOOD PHONE AT CHEAPER RATES THEN YOU CAN GO FOR THIS PHONE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"FRIENDS..........
      
      FLIPKART IS CHARGING PRICE BASED ON DEMAND SUPPLY THEORY SO ITS BETTER TO STOP DEMANDING SO AUTOMATICALLY PRICE WILL GO DOWN.
      
      THOSE WHO DOESNT BOTHER ABOUT MONEY I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THEM TO HELP OTHERS TO GET THIS PRODUCT WITH ACTUAL PRICE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"GUYS , I READ ALL THE REVIEWS HERE ON FLIPKART AND EVEN ELSEWHERE AND I WAS SO EGER TO BUY THIS CELL PHONE WHICH "" EVERYONE SAYS IS AWESOME "" ! ITS PROBABLY NOT
      
      
      THE  REASON I AM SUFFERING AFTER READING REVIEWS HERE IS I THOUGHT THE CAMERA IS 13MP BUT WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND CHECKED ITS NOT EVEN 8MP ! BUT , BUT IN DAYLIGHT ITS DIFFERENT THE CAMERA TURNS TO BE BRILLIANT COZ THE APERTURE IS HIGH AND CAN EXPOSE SUN WELL !
      
      
      AND ALL APPS DON'T GET TRANSFERRED TO THE MEMORY CARD * MAKE A NOTE OF THIS !!!!
      
      
      IT HAS GORILLA GLASS AND YOU CAN NOT USE A SCRATCH GUARD OF ANY OTHER MAKE YOU HAVE TO USE THE SUPPLIED
      
      
      ANOTHER MAJOR BACKDROP OF THIS PHONE IS VOLUME AND AUDIO OUTPUT !
      
      
      GUYS BEFORE YOU BUY PLEASE CHECK THIS CELL PHONE USING A EARPHONE OR ATTACH IT TO LOUD SPEAKER , YOU'LL FIND THE DIFFERENCE YOURSELF !!!!!!!
      
      
      THE VOLUME OUTPUT IS PATHETIC... ITS SOUND GOOD ONLY WHEN YOU USE A HIGH-OUT AMP IN CAR OR HOUSE BUT USED WITH A NORMAL STEREO IT DIFFERS !!!
      
      
      FRONT CAMERA HAS FIXED FOCUS !!!!!
      
      
      IF YOU ALL ARE FINE WITH THIS THEN GUYS THIS IS REALLY GOOD PHONE TO USE ! I FIND IT DIFFICULT COZ I NEEDED THIS PHONE FOR CAMERA AND MUSIC PURPOSE AND NOW I AM REGRETTING !!!!!!"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"I BOUGHT CANVAS 4 FROM FLIPKART FOR 18.5K!NOW IT'S AVAILABLE FOR 17K IN THE MARKET.
      
      THE PHONE IS OKAY BUT NOT THAT GREAT..
      
      -CAMERA QUALITY FOR 13MP IS SATISFACTORY
      
      -BUILD OF THE PHONE IS GOOD.
      
      -LOUDSPEAKER SOUND AS WELL AS LISTENING VIA EARPHONE..SOUND IS SATISFACTORY.
      
      -BLOW TO UNLOCK IS CRAP.YOU'LL HAVE TO BLOW YOUR LUNGS OUT FOR IT.
      
      -DONT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU LIKE TO PLAY HIGH END GAMES!!!!
      
      
      -GAMING GRAPHIC IS LOW(I INSTALLED REAL BOXING GRAPHIC IS REALLY LOW!!)
      
      GAME TAKES LOTSSSS OF TIME TO LOAD.
      
      FOR GAMES GO FOR NVIDIA TEGRA  PROCESSORS.(I DON'T KNOW HOW XOLO PLAY IS BUT                       YOU SHOULD HAVE A LOOK )
      
      
      -DISPLAY IT REALLY GOOD (HD)
      
      -LOOK AWAY TO PAUSE THE VIDEO WORKS REALLY WELL.
      
      
      I WOULD SUGGEST WAIT COLLECT MORE MONEY.. YOU'LL FIND A BETTER PHONE.."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"I BOUGHT CANVAS 4 ON 1 NOV 2013. EVERY THING IS VERY GOOD I MEAN VALUE FOR MONEY, GOOD FEATURES IN LOW PRICE EXCEPT BATTERY ISSUES. AFTER FEW MONTHS THERE IS PROBLEM IN THE PHONE THAT IT COULDN'T CHANGE WHEN THE MOBILE IS ON. I HAVE TO SWITCH IT OFF TO CHARGE IT. SECONDARY BATTERY EXHAUST VERY FAST IF YOU 100% FULL CHARGE IT THEN IT FINISH IN LESS THAN 20 HOURS WITH MINMAL USAGE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"I BOUGHT DIS DEVICE,BUT IM NOT SO HAPPY FROM MICROMAX...
      
      
      @ 18 K PRICE POINT THEY GIVE US A MEDIATECH 1.2GHZ QUAD CORE CHIP SET..IF U SPEND 6K MORE MONEY THEN NEXUS 4 IS AVLBL FOR U...NEXUS 4 1.5GHZ QUAD CORE SNAP DRAGON CHIP SET..BEST PERFORMER AT HHIS PRICE POINT..
      
      
      I THINK MICRO MAX MADE A MISTAKE ON PRICE SEGMENT..ITS SHOULD B WITH IN 15K
      
      
      CON OF DIS CANVAS 4- ASPHALT 7 HEAT DIS PARTICULAR GAME ITS NOT WORKING...AND ALL OTHERS HIGH END GAME WORKING IN OK OK MODE...MEANS GPU ITS NOT SO GOOD,..
      
      AND THE MOST DISADVANTAGE OF DIS MOB IS ITS 18K PRICE POINT...ITS SHOULD BE LESS PRICER,WHERE NEXUS 4 IS AVLBL 24K ALMOST
      
      
      PROS..PREMIUM LOOKING PHONE,VERY GOOD BATTERY LIFE"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FRIEND. THE MOBILE IS REALLY GOOD TO USE AT FIRST. IT SHOWED SIGNS OF HANGING AND OTHER PROBLEMS LATER. BUT ALL IN ALL THE PHONE IS WELL AND GOOD.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE &AMP; REPLACED IT 3 TIMES. HATS OFF TO FLIPKART FOR THEIR COOPERATION
      
      &AMP; THUMS DOWN TO MICROMAX'S THIS PRODUCT. IN MY FIRST PHONE CAMERA WAS NOT GUD,
      
      2ND PHONE SPEAKER WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY &AMP; THE LAST PHONE I GOT IS ALSO NOT 100% OK STILL PROBLEM IN HIS MUSIC PLAYER BY BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE MICROMAX CAN DO MUCH BETTER WITH THIS PRODUCT. AS I USED MICROMAX HD A116 ALSO SO I WILL RECOMMEND HD A116 INSTEAD OF A210. THANKS TO FLIPKART WHO REPLACED MY PHONE 3 TIMES."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"I GOT MICROMAX CANVAS 4 A210 THROUGH FLIPKART. FLIPKART SERVICE IS JUST GR8.
      
      MICROMAX SHOULD IMPROVE A LOT TO COMPETE WITH BRANDED COMPANIES
      
      HERE ARE SOME REVIEW ON THIS PRODUCT.
      
      
      LOOK: AWESOME
      
      CAMERA AND FLASH: VERY POOR
      
      BUILD QUALITY: POOR

      PERFORMANCE: GOOD
      
      BATTERY: GOOD (LAST FOR 1-2 DAYS)
      
      VALUE FOR MONEY: NO
      
      SCREEN (GLASS AND TOUCH): GREAT
      
      LESS SERVICE CENTERS"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST ONE WEEK. HERE IS MY EXPERIENCE:
      
      
      1) BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD. SPECS ARE GOOD ON PAPER. BUT SPEED IS NOT SO GREAT
      
      2) AUDIO QUALITY IS POOR.
      
      3) UNABLE TO CONNECT TO WIFI. I AM FACING ISSUES WITH WIFI. AND IT SEEMS WIFI IS NOT FUNCTIONING AT ALL."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"I LIKED TO HAVE ONE! BUT ANY ONE TELL ME IS IT SUPPORT ARABIC LANGUAGE FOR SMS ENCODING, I WANT TO SEND AND RECEIVE ARABIC SMS. BECAUSE MY OLD MICROMAX Q7 DID NOT.

      THANK YOU"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"I THINK ALL YOU WANTS FOR A GOOD SERVICE ALSO. BUT THAT'S VERY VERY POOR IN CASE OF MICROMAX. YOU HAVE TO WAIT 2 MONTHS MINIMUM FOR YOUR PROBLEM RESOLVE. FIRST THEY WILL ASK YOU TO DEPOSIT YOUR HANDSET FOR 15 WORKING DAYS. BUT IN 15 DAYS YOU WILL NEVER GET YOUR SET BACK. LOT OF TIME YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM AND, THAT IS THE TIME WHEN YOU WILL DEFINITELY REALIZE THAT WHY WHY &AMP; WHY YOU TOOK MICROMAX.
      
      
      SORRY I DON'T HAVE A ""CANVAS 4"". BUT I HAVE A ""CANVAS2"". IN A 1 YEAR OF USING OF THIS MOBILE,IT SHOWED PROBLEM 3 TIMES AND WAS IN SERVICE CENTER FOR AROUND 4 MONTH.
      
      
      GO WITH SOME REPUTED COMPANY, WHICH CAN GIVE YOU THE BETTER SERVICE IN MARKET."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"I THINK IT HAS ONLY 5 MP CAMERA MODULE...
      
      
      EVER YOU BUY  A PC WEBCAM  THAT COME WITH 32 MP CAM.. ...
      
      
      DO YOU REALLY  GET A 32 MP CAMERA MODULE , NO..... ALL THAT ARE TRAP.. THEY ARE SOFTWARE INTERPOLATED..
      
      ALL INDIAN MOBILE IMPORTER USING THIS TECHNIC TO MAKE YOU FOOL...
      
      COMPARE WITH A  BRANDED MOBILE HAVING ONLY 5 MP CAMERA, YOU WILL GET YOUR.ANS..
      
      YOU  CAN MAKE ANY CAMERA ( IN ANDROID MOBILE ) TO 13 MP JUST CHANGE UR MOBILE BUILD PROP. OR SEARCH IN XDA FORUM.
      
      RECENTLY I BOUGHT A XOLO A800 MOBILE, HAVING 8 MP CAMERA AND COME WITH ANDROID 4.0 (ICS) OS. BUT AFTER UPDATING TO OFFICIAL 4.1.1 (JB  ) I GOT 5 MP CAMERA ON MY MOBILE..
      
      NOW TELL ME WHEN U CAN DOWNGRADE YOUR CAMERA FROM 8 MP TO 5 MP THEN WHY DONT YOU UPGRADE FROM 5 MP TO 13 MP..."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"IT IS A GOOD MEDIUM RANGE PHONE FROM MICROMAX AND I WOULD  CALL IT A VALUE FOR MONEY ( IF PRICE WAS ARND 15K), HOWEVER THERE ARE COUPLE OF THINGS TO POINT TO WHAT CORNERS ARE CUT TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE
      
      
      1. THOUGH IT IS TOUTED A QUAD CORE AND HAVING PRETTY MUCH SAME PROCESSOR AS SAMSUNGS GALAXY HIGH ENDS AND ITS SIBLINGS ( LG, HTC ETC), IT IS NOT TRUE. PROCESSOR OF ALL MICROMAX PHONES ARE BASED ON OLD CORTEX A7 ARCHITECTURE. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS FAR BEHIND THE PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE TECHNOLOGY USED BY LATEST SAMSUNG,HTC AND OTHER SIMLAR RANGE PHONES. JUST TO LET YOU KNOW EVEN A LOW GZ DUAL PROCESSOR BASED ON A9-ARCH IS MUCH BETTER QUAD CORE PROCESSOR BASED ON A7 ARCHITECTURE
      
      
      2.  SCREEN RESOLUTION - 1280 * 720 WAS DEFACTO STANDARD FOR ALL THE OLD SAMSUNGS FLAGSHIP GALAXY PHONES, AND NOW IT IS A MUCH MUCH BETTER ON LATEST SAMSUNG AND OTHER HIGH END PHONES. HOWEVER CANVAS 4 HAS REACHED THIS DEFACTO STANDARD BUT STILL IT IS NOT TOO GREAT IN TERMS OF SCREEN QUALITY.
      
      
      3. MEMORY - 16GB ON BOARD IS MUCH BETTER OPTION THAN PREVIOUS GENERATION CANVAS
      
      
      4. RAM - COULD HAVE BEEN UPGRADED UPTO 2GB ( WAS HOPING 2GB IN NEW MODEL), 1GB IS QUITE OK
      
      
      5. BATTERY - NOT TOO POWERFUL
      
      
      6. LOOKS - BEAUTY AND DOESNT FEELS CHEAP AT ALL
      
      
      FINAL RECOMMENDATION - IT IS MUCH BETTER DEAL THAN SAMSUNG GRAND( AND LOOK ALIKES) AND OTHER LOW END GALAXY, HTC , LG TOCUH SCREEN SMART PHONES, HOWEVER PLEASE DONT COMPARE IT WITH HIGH END PHONES LIKE S4/S3
      
      PRICE - I THINK 15K WOULD HAVE BEEN A RIGHT PRICE FOR IT"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT BUT LIKE OTHER MOBILES HAVE FEW NEGATIVE POINTS, WHICH MAY BIT IRITATE US.
      
      
      - TRANSPARANT FLIP COVER GIVE AN ATTRACTIVE FEEL, BUT THE COVER ILL NOT FIT/CLOSE PERFECTLY.
      
      - FEW PICS CAPTURED FROM OTHER MOBILE CAM MAY NOT SUPPORT.
      
      - SUGGEST NOT TO GO FOR LIVE WALLPAPERS, BATTERY DRAINS FAST.
      
      APART FROM ABOVE POINTS.... THIS PHONE IS REALLY AWSOME.TRY TO WATCH ANY HD CLIPS, TRUST ME YOU WILL NEVER LOOK FOR OTHER MOBILES."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,NO POINT OF THE GORILLA GLASS...THE SCREEN GETS SCRATCHES VERY EASILY....THE PHONE IS VERY DELICATE....AND ONE MORE CON ABT THE PHONE IS ITS CAMERA....THE LOW LIGHT IMAGING IS VERY BAD....ON THE WHOLE THE PHONE IS QUITE OK...
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,3,"OVERALL THE PHONE IS GOOD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CAMERA QUALITY. IT SUCKS BIG TIME.
      
      THEY ARE SAYING THAT ITS 13 MP BUT I PERSONALLY THINK THAT ITS NOT EVEN 5MP.

      YOU CAN VISIT ANY MICROMAX CHECKPOINT NEARBY YOU AND SEE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE POURING IN WITH FAULTY PHONES AND MOST OF THEM GETTING PISSED OFF TO GET THEIR PHONES BACK ON TIME...

      MY HEADPHONE STOPPED WORKING WITHIN THREE MONTHS.. I SUBMITTED IT IN THIS CHECKPOINT IN PUNE.

NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I'D HAVE TO WAIT.
      
      
      IF THIS IS THE SCENARIO ONLY FOR HEADPHONES... THINK ABOUT THE PHONE.

      - AWESOME GREAT LOOK
      
      - SPECIALLY ALUMINUM SIDE BODY AND FLIP COVER
      
      - LIGHT WEIGHT
      
      - ADDONS LIKE SHAKE UNLOCK AND SMART GUESTURE COMMANDS

      - WORST FLIPCOVER GIVE SCRATCHES ON SCREEN .
      
      - WORST SCREEN GUARD ..NOT COVERING ENTIRE SCREEN
      
      - NO PREINSTALLED APPS LIKE WHATSAPP, FREE GAMES, FACEBOOK ETC.. THT'S OKAY CAN INSTALL LATER .

      THIS COULD BE A SINGLE OPTION IF THEY THOUGHT BIT ON BATTERY AND  FRONT LOOK WITHOUT FLIPCOVER .
      
      
      ALSO PRICE SHOULD NOT BE MORE THAN 12K .. FOR THIS .

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,2,"HI GUYS,
      
      
      DONT GO FOR THIS MOBILE...IT IS NOT WORTH OF IT...ALWAYS TRUST BRAND MOBILES LIKE SAMSUNG,NOKIA,SONY,LG ....IF YOU WANT GO FOR LOW RANGE SMART PHONES..ALWAYS PERFER TO TAKE LENOVO P780 OR PANASONIC P15"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR A FRIEND. THE SPECIFICATIONS ON PAPER ARE JAW-DROPPING AT THE STATED PRICE-POINT. BUT A MICROMAX WILL ALWAYS BE A MICROMAX. HAVING USED SAMSUNG AND SONY ANDROID PHONES, I DIDN'T LIKE THE QUALITY OFFERED BY MICROMAX. MICROMAX IS JUST NOT THERE IN THAT LEAGUE. THE CAMERA, FOR INSTANCE IS OF 8 MP, BUT ITS PICTURE QUALITY IS POORER THAN MOST 5 MP CAMERAS. THE TOUCH INTERFACE ALSO DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH OF AN IMPRESSION MARK. SPEED AND PERFORMANCE IS GOOD. BATTERY BACK UP IS FINE. GO FOR IT IF YOU'RE NOT MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR SOCIAL STATURE AND IF YOU USE APPS AND GAMES MORE THAN CAMERA IN YOUR DAILY USE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,2,I HAD THIS PHONE FOR ABT A MONTH NOW. IT SRTED HANGING AFTER 10 DAYS OF BUYING ITSELF. CAMERA IS OK IN BRIGHT LIGHT BUT IN SHADE ITS LIKE A 2MP CAMERA. AND IN DARK ITS NOT EVEN ABLE TO CAPTURE PHOTOS POPERLY. ITS AL GRAINY. PROCESSOR IS OK LIKE FAST. BUT HANGS SOMETIMES ON STARTUP OF CANVAS 4 AND SOMETIMES ON THE MENU. THE LOOKAWAY PAUSE IS NOT ACURATE. BUT WORKS LIKE A CHARM SOMETIMES. SERVICE CENTRE TAKES 1 MONTH TO REPAIR PHONE. NOW MY PHONE I WWITH THEM ONLY. SO GO FOR SOME OTHER PHONE OF THE SAME CASH. BUT IF U LIKE TO CHNGE UR PHONE EVEEY 4 MONTHS THN THIS PHONE IS OK.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,2,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE 8 MONTHS BACK.AFTER 2 MONTHS IT GOT COMPLAINED(DISPLAY PROBLEM) AND GIVEN TO COCHIN SERVICE CENTER.
      
      AFTER 15 DAYS I GOT MY PHONE BACK.
      
      BUT AFTER 5 MONTHS IT GOT AGAIN COMPLAINED(SAME DISPLAY PROBLEM). I HAVE NOT YET GOT THE ITEM BACK AFTER REPAIR.(30 DAYS ALREADY).
      
      INITIALLY WHEN I CALLED THEM, THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER 20 DAYS TO BE GET REPAIRED.
      
      WHEN I CALLED AFTER 20 DAYS THEY TOLD ME TO PLEASE WAIT FOR ANOTHER 20 DAYS.(OMG!!)
      
      I THINK YOU WONT BELIEVE IT.BUT ITS TRUE!!!!
      
      THEIR BEHAVIOR SEEM TO BE LIKE THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS AFTER PURCHASE.I CANT BELIEVE THIS.SUCH A POOR SERVICE FACILITY THEY HAVE.
      
      THINK 100 TIMES BEFORE BUY MICROMAX.(ONCE YOUR PHONE GET COMPLAINT THEN YOU WILL BE HAVING ONLY TIME TO CALL THEM:-()
      
      
      I'M NOT CURSING MUCH ON THE PHONE.MEANWHILE I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE MISERABLE SERVICE THEY PROVIDE.!!!"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,2,"I JUST ORDERED MICROMAX CANVAS 2 PLUS AS CANVAS 4 AND CANVAS 2 PLUS HAVE SIMILAR HARDWARE, BENCHMARK SCORE FOR CANVAS 2 PLUS IS BETTER THAN CANVA 4, MY FRIEND OWNS A CANVAS 4,  NENAMARK2  RESULTS FOR CANVAS 4 ARE 46.2 FPS WHEREAS FOR CANVAS 2 PLUS ITS 54.6 FPS, MUNLOCK FEATURE IS AVAILABLE FOR ANY ANDROID PHONE ON NET, THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN BOTH PHONES  IS THE CAMERA AND HEARPHONES .."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,2,"I PURCHASED THIS MOBILE FROM OPEN MARKET. AND HERE ARE SOME VIEWS ON IT -
      
      
      CONS -
      
      
      1. 13 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA IS OF NO USE. YOU CAN NOT USE IT IN LOW LIGHT CONDITION AND NIGHT. DISAPPOINTED CAMERA QUALITY
      
      2. FLASH IS PATHETIC. BETTER TO BUY A SAMSUNG PHONE WITH 3 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA AND  FLASH.
      
      3. PROCESSING SPEED IS OK BUT NOT TOO GOOD. MOST OF THE GAMES LAGS MOST OF THE TIMES.
      
      4. PRICE IS TOO MUCH. IT SHOULD NOT BE MORE THEN 12-13K.
      
      5. PHONE'S SIZE IS LARGE. NOT EASY TO USE AND HANDLE.
      
      
      PROS -
      
      
      1. 16 GB INBUILT MEMORY.
      
      
      CONCLUSION - THERE IS NOTHING IN CANVAS 4 THAT COULD BOUND YOU TO PURCHASE IT. IF YOU USE PHONE'S CAMERA PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT. BETTER TO BUY A SAMSUNG OR NOKIA LUMIA. THERE IS NO USE OF 13 MEGAPIXEL IF QUALITY IS POOR. OUTDOOR IMAGES ARE DECENT BUT INDOOR IMAGES ARE WORST AND BELOW AVERAGE. AT THIS PRICE YOU CAN EASILY BUY A GOOD SAMSUNG NOKIA OR SONY PHONE."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,2,"I
      
      I AM USING MICROMAX CANVAS HD &AMP; MICROMAX CANVAS 4 BOTH...

      1- PRICE
      
      2- CAMERA (IN DAY ONLY) RESULT IN NIGHT ITS TOO GOOD IN 4..
      
      ABOVE FEATURES ARE BETTER THAN CANVAS 4 IN CANVAS HD
      
      BUT THE LOOK OF CANVAS 4 IS EXTREMELY GOOD..
      
      STYLISH DESIGN, SLIM &AMP; GREAT FEATURES LIKE SAMSUNG GALAXY 4
      
      BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED ABOUT PROCCESSOR &AMP; RAM ITS SAME AS CANVAS HD
      
      THE FRONT CAMERA OF THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD OF 5 MP.
      
      REAR CAMERA OF 13MP BUT ITS NOT GOOD AS MY EXPECTATION..
      
      OVERALL, 17999 CANNOT BE A FAIR PRICE FOR THIS PHONE...."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,2,"JUST BEFORE THEY GIVE AN OFFER OF X% OFF, THEY HIKE THE ORIGINAL PRICE BY 2X%. LIKE THE GOVT DO WITH PETROL PRICES...FIRST THEY INCREASE BY RS 3 AND THEN TO COMPENSATE REDUCE BY 10P."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,2,"JUST COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK I TOOK THIS MOBILE. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS WAS DROPPED FROM THE TABLE AND THE WHOLE DISPLAY WAS GONE. THE SO CALLED GREAT GORILLA GLASS ALSO COULD NOT PROTECT THE MOBILE FROM THE DAMAGE.
      
      
      COCERN IS THESE KIND OF HIGH END MOBILES SHOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO TOLERATE AND IT IS NOT OF THAT MUCH AS EXPECTED. 1 - 2 METER HIEGHT IS NOT MUCH. I HAD SIMILAR FALLS WITH MY SAMSUNG GALAXY YOUNG AND TILL NOW NOTHING HAPPEND AND NEVER STEPPED INTO THE DOORS OF THE SERVICE.
      
      
      MY EXPERIENCE IS THOUGH WE PAY MORE TO BRANDS, FOR SURE THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS SOME WHAT LIKE GOOD BUILD AND MAKE.
      
      
      I AM NOT AGAINST TO ANY BRAND WHO PROVIDES THE BEST QUALITY.  I BELIVE IN QUALITY AND QUALITY DOESN'T MEAN SIMPLY PROVIDING THE COMPETITIVE FEATURES BUNDLED IN WEEK BODY. IT LOOKS LIKE, THE SOLDIER IN THE WAR WITHOUT ANY SHIELD.
      
      
      AND ALSO THE SERVICE IS SO BAD. I HAD GIVEN FOR THE DISPLAY CHANGE ON 2-NOV-2013 AND TILL NOW THE SERVICE CENTER AT YALAHANKA COULD NOT SERVICE IT. THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY PROF. SERVICE ATTITUDE ALSO. NO ONE CARES FOR A CUSTOMER.

SO IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS PHONE THERE THEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THIS PHONE COMES TO ITS ORIGINAL PRICE I.E. 15K CANVAS 4 SUPPORTS 850/900/1800/1900 MHZ BANDS FOR GSM AND 2100 MHZ FOR UMTS.

IT STARTED GIVING TROUBLE FROM 20TH AUG 2013. AS MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THAT LOCATION THE SAME WAS BROUGHT TO ALLAHABAD ON 27TH AUG AND WAS SUBMITTED TO RADIO CENTER. THEY RETURNED THE PHONE SAME DAY SAYING THAT PROBLEM HAS BEEN RESOLVED. WHEN USED THE PROBLEM WAS NOT RESOLVED AND THE PHONE WAS REBOOTING AT CERTAIN INTERVAL AUTOMATICALLY. THE SAME PROBLEM FACED FROM 20TH AUG 2013. THE PHONE WAS AGAIN SUBMITTED TO MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER ""RADIO CENTER"" ON 28TH AUG. AGAIN THEY RETURNED THE PHONE SAME DAY AFTER FEW HOURS STATING THAT THE SAME HAS BEEN REPAIRED. WHEN USED THE PROBLEM WAS STILL NOT REPAIRED, AND THE SAME PROBLEM ""REBOOTING AT CERTAIN INTERVAL AUTOMATICALLY"" WAS THERE. THE PHONE WAS AGAIN GIVEN TO RADIO CENTER ON 29TH AUG AND ALSO A COMPLAIN WAS LODGED ON MICROMAX HELPLINE (COMPLAIN NO. 2808138525). THE ONLY THING AFTER LODGING THE COMPLAIN ON MICROMAX HELPLINE HAPPENED IS THAT RADIO CENTER DIDNT RETURNED THE PHONE AND KEPT IT THEMSELVES STATING THAT IT WILL TAKE 7 DAYS TO RECTIFY THE SAME.
      
      TODAY IT IS ALMOST 13 DAYS AND WHEN CONTACTED TO MICROMAX HELPLINE, THEY ARE SAYING IT WILL TAKE MINIMUM 20 DAYS MORE FOR REPAIR TO TAKE PLACE.
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT A PHONE FOR RS. 20,000. USED ONLY FOR 5 DAYS AND I HAVE TO SUBMIT IT TO MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER FOR MORE THAN 30 DAYS THATS TO NOT GUARANTEE, AS PER MICROMAX CUSTOMER CARE ITS THE MINIMUM PERIOD."

      LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY CAN NOT BE DONE WITH THIS PHONE,U'LL GET DISASTER RESULTS.
      
      THE FLASH ON THIS CAMERA IS VERY WEAK BUT IT BURNS THE PHOTOS IF CLICKED NEAR THE SUBJECT.
      
      AUTO FOCUS FUNCTION NEEDS TO BE FIXED IN THIS PHONE. SOMETIMES UNDER SUNLIGHT THE AUTO FOCUS WORKS...MOST OF THE TIME ITS A WASTE.
      
      THE FRONT FACING 5MP CAMERA IS ALSO A JOKE. ITS THE SCREEN WHICH MAKES THEM SEEM NATURAL OR VIVID OR SATURATED.
      
      
      THE CANVAS HD HAVING A 8MP CAMERA GIVES BETTER CAMERA PERFORMANCE THAN THIS PHONE.

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,BOUGHT IN JULY 2013. PROBLEMS STARTED FROM SECOND MONTH ONLY. IN DEC END STOPPED COMPLETELY.

NEXT DAY WHEN CONTACTED DEALER TOLD THAT BATTERY HAS SWOLLEN AND THAT IT HAS BEEN MISHANDLED AND ALL. NOW I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WAIT FAR 15 DAYS AT LEAST TO REPLACE THE BATTERY. NOW I HAVE NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO WAIT AND WATCH WHEATHER I GET RESPONSE OR NOT. AS HAVE NO CHOICE AM RATING 1 STAR. TRUELY ITS WORST
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,CANVAS HD IS BETTER THEN CANVAS 4 IF U HAVING CANVAS HD DONT BUY CANVAS 4. THEY JUST FOOLING PPL WITH SOFTWARES THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON HARDWARE NOT ON SOFTWARE AS SOFTWARE IS GETTABLE WITH MANY APPS SO ITS A FAIL PRODUCT BY MICROMAX

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"FLIPKART CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WROST. AND THE SHIPPING OF THE HORRIBLE THING.IT TOOK 10DAYS TO DELIVERY THE UNIT.. AFTER I RECEVIED THE UNIT ,THE HEADSET IS DEFECTIVE ,AGAIN"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO APPRECIATED THIS PHONE SEEN IT'S SPECS? FULL HD HANDSETS LIKE IBERRY NUCLEA N1 AND SPICE FHD ARE AVAILABLE AT THE SAME PRICE. MICROMAX HAS JUST GIVEN AN UPDATE IN LOOKS AND NOTHING ELSE.
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"HI,
      
      
      I WAS USING SAMSUNG NEXUS S (1GZ CORTEX-A8, 512 RAM, JELLYBEAN 4.1), DECIDED TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT SEEING THE SPECS (1.2GZ QUADCORE CORTEX-A7, 1GB RAM, JELLYBEAN 4.2) . AFTER RECIEVEING THE PRODUCT IT HAD SERIOUS ISSUES....
      
      
      A COMPARISON BETWEEN MY OLD PHOVE NEXUS S VS CANVAS 4
      
      
      1. GPS DOESNOT CONNECT FOR 1/2 AN HOUR EVEN IF U STAND ON MIDDLE OF THE READ WITH SKY VIEW, FORGET ABOUT GPS CONNECTIVITY INSIDE THE CAR VS NEXUS AROUND 2 MINS INSIDE THE CAR.
      
      
      2.  GPS ACCURACY VARIES FROM 27-65 MTRS VS NEXUS PINPOINT ACCURACY WITH GOOGLE MAPS.
      
      
      3. NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS OF NO USE, WHEN IM DRIVING ON WEH ANDHERI IT SHOWS AS ME DRIVING ON TELI GALLI.
      
      
      4. GRAPHICS LAGS WITH HIGH SPECS GAME (NFS HOT PURSUIT) AND SCREEN SUDDENLY GOES BLIND TO LOAD THE GRAPHICS BACK AGAIN. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY GAMING PERFORMANCE LAGS EVEN AFTER HAVING DOUBLE THE SPECS.
      
      
      5. SOUND QUALITY IS PATHETIC FOR VOICE CALLING AND FOR SONGS, CANVAS 4 - 100% VOL = NEXUS S - 60%.
      
      
      AFTERALL I TOUGHT IT WAS PRODUCT DEFECT AND GOT A REPLACEMENT FROM FLIPCART :).
      
      HOWEVER I CHECKED FOR GPS, GRAPHICS WITH GAMES &AMP; SOUND QUALITY ITS STILL THE SAME.
      
      
      MY ADVISE SAMSUNG PHONES WITH HALF THE SPECS IS FAR BETTER THAN CANVAS 4."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"HI,

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"I BOUGHT A MICROMAX CANVAS-4 , BUT I AM SUFFERING USING THIS PHONE AS WIFI DOES NOT CONNECT UNTIL UNLESS YOU ARE RIGHT UNDER THE ACCESS POINT. I AM FACING THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
      
      
      1. IT CONNECTS TO WIFI ONLY IF THE ACCESS POINT IS VERY NEAR, IF I MOVE A LITTLE AWAY, IT CANNOT DETECT THE SIGNAL.
      
      2. IT KEEPS DROPPING THE WIFI CONNECTION
      
      
      I UNDERSTAND ITS METAL BODY WORKS AS WIFI ANTENNA BUT I AM EXPERIENCING VERY POOR WIFI PERFORMANCE IN CANVAS-4.
      
      I HAVE USED CANVAS 2 AND CANVAS HD AND DIDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM.
      
      MY WIFE AND SON BOTH ARE USING CANVAS HD AND DON'T HAVE ANY WIFI SIGNAL PROBLEM WITH THE SAME ACCESS POINT, BUT ONLY CANVAS-4 HAS THE WIFI CONNECTION PROBLEM.
      
      
      BE CAREFUL WHEN BUYING A CANVAS-4.
      
      OTHERWISE, IT SEEMS IT IS FULL OF BUGS AND BEHAVES ERRATICALLY.

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR MICROMAX CANVAS A76. BUT WILL SPREAD EQUAL SHADOW ON ALL MICROMAX PHONES
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE APPROX 2 MONTHS AGO FROM LOCAL DEALER AFTER READING THE REVIEWS FROM FLIPKART AND OTHER WEBSITES AND ALSO THE PRICE WAS LOW IN LOCAL MARKET. I WAS ASTONISHED BY THE WAY PHONE LOOKS. I MEAN WHO WOULD NOT. IN MERE 8K YOU ARE GETTING A 5 INCH SCREEN, A 1.2 GHZ PROCESSOR AND WHAT NOT. IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH OTHER PHONES HERE ON FLIPKART, ITS SPECS WILL MATCH WITH GALAXY GRAND WHICH IS 17K APPROX RIGHT NOW.
      
      
      NOW I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS PHONE. AFTER EXACT 16 DAYS OF USE, THE THREE TOUCH BUTTONS OF PHONE STOPPED RESPONDING. NOT EVEN THAT, I HAVE TO REBOOT THE PHONE MAKE THEM FUNCTIONING AGAIN. THEN I FOUND OUT THAT IF I LOCK AND UNLOCK THE PHONE AGAIN, THE BUTTONS AGAIN START WORKING BUT AFTER JUST 3-4 MINUTES OF USAGE, THEY GET UNRESPONSIVE.
      
      NOW I WENT TO THE MICROMAX CARE. WHICH WAS INDEED A TOUGHEST JOB. THE SERVICE HAS NOWHERE WRITTEN A WORD ABOUT MICROMAX. I ASKED NEARBY PEOPLE AND THEY SAID THAT MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER IS ONE WITH THE GREEN DOORS. SO. I FOUND IT AND WENT INSIDE
      
      THE CUSTOMER CARE NOW TOLD ME THAT THE ENTIRE TOUCH SCREEN IS DAMAGED FROM INSIDE AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THEY TOLD ME TO COME BACK AFTER 7 DAYS, BUT I GOT MY PHONE IN 19 DAYS. NOW I WAS AGAIN HAPPY THAT AT LAST IT IS WORKING WELL, BUTTERY SMOOTH ETC.. BUT MY EXPECTATIONS WERE ABOUT TO RISE AND THE CAMERA STOPPED WORKING. I MEAN WHAT THE HELL. I JUST BROUGHT THE PHONE FROM SERVICE CENTER AND THE CAMERA STOPPED WORKING.
      
      NEXT DAY I WENT TO SERVICE CENTRE AGAIN AND ASKED WHAT THE HECK IS PROBLEM AND WHY YOU PEOPLE DON'T CHECK THE PHONE THOROUGHLY BEFORE HANDLING IT BACK! I GAVE MY PHONE, THEY SAID IT WILL TAKE AROUND 1/2 HOUR TO LOCATE THE EXACT PROBLEM. AFTER 1 HOUR, A GUY CAME OUT AND SAID THAT CAMERA MODULE IS DAMAGED AND WILL BE NEEDED REPLACMENT. I GENTLY ASKED HOW MUCH TIME IT WILL TAKE TO REPAIR? THEY SAID, AROUND 10 DAYS. I ASKED WHY SO MUCH TIME? THEY SAID THAT CAMERA MODULE ASSEMBLY IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE NEED TO ORDER IT.
      
      TODAY, 20 DAYS ARE OVER. I CALLED THEM AND THEY REPLY: SIR YOUR PHONE WILL TAKE TIME.
      
      SO, IF YOU CALCULATE THE EXACT DAYS ABOVE, THE PHONE WAS IN SERVICE CENTRE FOR 20+19 = 39 DAYS AND WAS IN MY POCKET FOR ONLY 15 AND 1/2 DAYS.
      
      BEFORE YOU START THINKING THAT THIS PROBLEM MAY OCCUR IN FEW HANDSETS OR I WAS ""UNLUCKY"" WITH THIS PIECE. I WANT YOU ALL TO FIRST GO TO THE SERVICE CENTRE OF MICROMAX AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE STANDING THERE IN QUEUE TO GET THERE PHONES READY. NOT ONLY THAT, I MET 4 GUYS WITH MICROMAX A76 CANVAS WITHE EXACT PROBLEMS AND ONE OF THE GUY WAS SHOUTING BECAUSE HIS PHONE WAS IN SERVICE CENTRE FOR PAST 3 MONTHS.
      
      THE COMPANIES LIKE MICROMAX ARE ONLY BRAND NAME. THEY DONOT MANUFACTURE ANYTHING. WHAT THEY DO IS GIVING LARGE ORDERS TO COMPANIES IN CHINA. THESE COMPANIES ARE ALSO VERY WELL KNOWN AS ""CHINA MOBILE"". THEY MAKE THE HARDWARE WITH CHEAPEST COMPONENT THEY GET AND SEND THEM TO INDIA. ONCE IT DELIVERS TO INDIA, OUR GUYS PUT A MICROMAX LOGO ON THE PHONE AND SELL IT.
      
      
      THE SAME GOES WITH KARBONN, XOLO, MAXX AND OTHER 'GOD KNOWS' BRANDS.
      
      IF SOME GUY WORKING FOR MICROMAX IS READING THIS REVIEW, I WANT TO PUT SOME POINTS THAT MAY HELP YOU:
      
      YOU GUYS ARE LOOTING THE COMMON MAN'S MONEY. YOU SELL THE PHONE AT VERY LOW COST AND THEN MAKES PROFIT WITH THE AFTER SERVICE.
      
      YOU TOO KNOW HOW SHITTY YOUR PHONES ARE SO PLEASE KEEP STOCKS OF THE ESSENTIAL HARDWARE IN SERVICE CENTRE.
      
      STOP HAVING BIG CELEBRITIES LIKE HUGH JACKMAN IN YOUR ADS. YOUR COMPANY SUCKS AT LEAST DON'T MAKE THEM INFAMOUS. I KNOW THAT HE DO NOT EVEN USE YOUR PHONE.
      
      AND PLEASE HIRE SOME GOOD WORKERS AND DEVELOP SOMETHING HERE IN INDIA. DON'T FOOL US.
      
      MY REVIEW IS WHOLEHEARTEDLY HONEST AND TRUE. IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME YET THEN GO BUY THIS AND SUFFER. I DO NOT HAVE ANY TIME TO JEOPARDIZE ANY ONE HERE I JUST WANT TO PUT THE POINTS WHICH ARE ACTUAL REALITY."

Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"THE MMX ARE MAKING FOOL OUT OF PEOPLE HERE,, MANY OF MY FRNDS ORDERED CANVAS 4 ON 8 BUT STILL NOT DELIVERED,,, NO CONTACT NUMBERS MENTIONED IN THE WEBSITE ARE WORKING.
      
      
      NOBODY SHOW RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS TO CUSTOMER,,"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"THE PHONE LOOKS GOOD ON SPECS. BUT I JUST WANT TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE ABOUT A MICROMAX A111 THAT I AM ""NOT"" USING. NOT THAT I DON'T WANT TO, BUT I JUST CAN'T. WHY YOU ASK?
      
      
      1. BECAUSE IT STARTED GIVING PROBLEMS RIGHT AWAY. THE DISPLAY STARTED FLICKERING AND LINES ON THE LCD. MICROMAX AFTER SALES SERVICE IS QUITE POOR. ALMOST NON-EXISTANT. THEY REFUSED TO COMMIT TO ANYTHING AND EVEN REPLACE OR REPAIR THE PHONE.
      
      
      2. I ESCALATED THE MATTER TO THE RETAILER. ONLY AFTER GETTING IN TOUCH WITH THE TOP BRASS, MICROMAX AGREED TO FAST-TRACK THE PROCESS. THEY AGREED TO REPAIR THE PHONE, FREE OF COST. 6 WEEKS AFTER PURCHASE, I RECEIVED THE REPAIRED PHONE.
      
      
      3. THE DISPLAY WAS OKAY. MICROMAX HAD REPAIRED IT, BUT THE TOUCHSCREEN DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE! HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT USING A TOUCH PHONE, WITHOUT A TOUCHSCREEN? MICROMAX DOES NOT BOTHER TO ANSWER.
      
      
      FOR THE FEW DAYS THE PHONE WAS ACTUALLY WORKING, I HAD NOTICED SOME GLITCHES. IT USED TO BECOME SLUGGISH AND SOMETIMES HANG. ONLY WAY TO REVIVE IT WAS TO REMOVE THE BATTERY. AT FIRST I SUSPECTED SOME APP, BUT SEVERAL FACTORY RESETS ALSO DIDN'T SOLVE THOSE ISSUES.
      
      
      I HAVE ALREADY WASTED INR 12K AND 8 WEEKS. I JUST HOPE THAT YOU DON'T. SO SAY A LITTLE PRAYER BEFORE YOU BUY A MICROMAX. BEST OF LUCK!"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"THE PHONE PRICE IS MUCH MORE THAN CITY OUTLETS ITS 17,199 IN CITY MOBILE OUTLETS AND ALSO IN HIPCART.COM
      
      
      FLIRTCART IS POPULAR FOR ITS OFFERS WHERE IT IS NOT PROVIDING FOR MOBILES, DUE TO WHICH THE FLIPCART IS GETTING FOR THIS REASON ONLY IN CASE OF MOBILE BUT NOT IN CASE OF OTHER OFFERS WHAT IT IS PROVING FOR OTHER ACCESSORIES"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"THE RANGE OF THE MICROMAX CANVAS 4 IS VERY POOR ,AND IT NOT WORKS IF U GO OUT OF ROOM,OTHER MOBILES IN MY HOME LIKE SAMSUNG ,NOKIA  ARE WORKING EVEN 5 TIMES THE DISTANCE .
      
      SMART PHONE WITH POOR WIFI IS WAISTAGE OF MONEY."
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"THIS MOBILE I BOUGHT ON 6TH OCT THROUGH FLIPCART  , WS RETAILER , THE PROCESSOR IS QUITE FAST AND DISPLAY IS QUITE GOOD BETTER THAN SAMSUNG GRAND DUOS , BUT THE PROBLEM I FACED IS BATTERY WHICH WAS HEATING UP DURING CHARGING SO IF UR MOBILE IS CONNECTED FOR CHARGING ABOUT ONE HOUR OR MORE AND U TAKE OUT FOR CALLING ITS DIFFICULT TO HOLD IT CLOSE TO UR EAR AND WHILE USING ALSO USING FOR ABOUT 1/2 HR CONTINUOUSLY FOR INTERNET SURFING , U CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE IN MOBILE TEMP. SO THIS WAS MAIN ISSUE AND I HEARD FROM ONE OF MY FRIEND REAGARDING SERVICING ISSUE ALWAYS WITH MICROMAX .....ANYWAY THANKS TO FLIPCART AND WS REATILER WHO HAVE ACCEPTED MY MOBILE FOR REFUND AND CREDITED BACK MY WHOLE BALANCE TO MY FLIPCART WALLET .......THANKS"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"TO MY KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN GET SIMILAR FEATURES IN INTEX AQUA 5
      
      AND ITS CC IS GOOD AND IT HAS A QHD DISPLAY SO ITS COMES WITH IN 11K SO GUYS GO FOR IT
      
      ITS HAS 5 INCH DISPLAY BUT YOU CAN NOT GET THIS MOBIL IN FLIP CART Y THEY ARE NOT FEATURING THIS MOBILE I DON'T KNOW"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"YOU BUY A MICROMAX PHONE IT IS LIKE BUYING A LOTTERY TICKET, YOU MAY GET A GOOD ONE BUT IF YOU GET A BAD PHONE THE SERVICE IS THE WORST. I HAVE PURCHASED A A210 THROUGH FLIPKART IN OCTOBER, ON ITS ARRIVAL WE FOUND WIFI AND BLUETOOTH WERE NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AND SUBMITTED FOR SERVICE AT HYDERABAD(SRI DHATRE MOBILES) THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE RECTIFIED IT BUT WHEN I STARTED USING IT FOUND THAT THE VOLUME KEY IS NOT WORKING AS WELL AS NO IMPROVEMENT FOUND IN WIFI AND BLUETOOTH. THE SECOND VISIT TO THE SERVICE CENTER THEY SAID THEY WILL CHANGE THE MOTHER BOARD. HOWEVER ON RECEIPT OF THE PHONE WE FOUND THAT THE IMIE NO IS MISSING FOR WHICH SERVICE CENTER MANAGER MR. NAGESWARA RAO SAYS IT THE HARDWARE THEY GOT FROM MICROMAX AND THAT I SHOULD NOT RESET THE PHONE.IN THE THIRD VISIT THEY HAVE RECTIFIED THIS PROBLEM BUT I FOUND THE MICROPHONE AND SPEAKER ARE NOT WORKING THE BASIC PHONE ITSELF IS NOT WORKING NOW. ALL THIS TOOK MORE THAN ONE MONTH AND MY PHONE IS STILL WITH THE SERVICE CENTER.
      
      
      WHEN WE TRIED TO CONTACT MICROMAX GURGAON SERVICE CENTER THEY ARE EVEN MORE WORSE THEY DON'T RESPOND AT ALL AND ARE WORSE THAN THE EXECUTIVE AT A PUBLIC SECTOR BANK.
      
      
      HENCE I RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY A LOTTERY(MICROMAX) PHONE ELSE YOU MAY END UP LIKE ME LOOSING RS. 16000/-"
Micromax Canvas 4 A210,1,"YOU DONT HAVE TO READ OTHER PEOPLES OPINIONS...
      
      JUST GO TO MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER AND SPEND 3-4HOURS THERE AND LISTEN TO THEIR CUSTOMERS YELL...
      
      N THEN BUY ONE IF U STILL DARE...
      
      (LAST TIME I WENT THERE I GOT TO SEE POLICE, A LADY DEMANDING TO TALK TO SUPERIORS SUPERIOR, A PERSON WHO HAD BEEN WAITING 4 MONTHS FOR REPAIR OF HIS PHONE...LOL...)"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"AFTER USE OF 6 MONTHS, I FACED ONE MAJOR ISSUE, AFTER USE OF AROUND 20 DAYS, SUDDENLY DER ARE FEW LINES ON THE SCREEN LOWER PART AND WHEN I WENT TO MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER THEY TOOK THE DEVICE AND THEN THEY TOOK 2 MONTHS TO REPAIR MY DEVICE.
      
      
      MICROMAX SERVICE REALLY SUCKS !
      
      
      GUYS PLEASE THINK ABOUT 1000 TIMES ABOUT MICROMAX SERVICE BEFORE BUYING ANY MICROMAX DEVICE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"AMAZING PHONE WITH GREAT FEATURES, AND CHEAPER ON FLIPKART, NOW OTHER VARIANT IS AVAILABLE ON NET, BUT I THINK OLD IS GOLD FOREVER, GO FOR IT BEST AND EXCELLENT IN ITS RANGE."

      SIMPLY AMAZING :D"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"AT THIS PRICE, CONSIDER YOUR SELF EXTREMELY LUCKY FOR GETTING A PHONE WHICH WOULD GENERALLY COST 20K FOR OTHER BRANDS."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,AWESOME PRODUCT..... GREAT SERVICE FROM FLIPKART...... STILL WORKING EVEN AFTER SIX MONTHS WITH NO GLITCHES.... VFM... ONLY GPS NEEDS TO BE STRONGER
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,BOTH PRODUCT &AMP; THE FLIPKART DOES WHAT IT SAYS. VERY HAPPY EXPERIENCE. FLIPKART DISCOUNTS &AMP; THE BANK DISCOUNTS COMBO MAKES THIS THE BEST PLACE TO BUY.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"BOUGHT IT 2 WEEKS EARLIER..A SPEEDOO 24 HRS DELIVERY BY FLIPKART, USED IT VERY ROUGHLY, BUT NOTHINGS SEEMS TO HAPPEN TO IT, IT IS AS SMOOTH AS A NEW DEVICE.. HOPE TO GET THIS KINDA PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT.. AND IF AN INDIAN COMPANY SUCH AS MICROMAX PRODUCES ITEMS LIKE THESE THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO BUY FOREIGN BRANDS.. HAT'S OFF MICROMAX.."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"BOUGHT THIS DEVICE FROM FLIPKART.  FLIPKART'S DELIVERY EXCELLENT.  ABOUT THE DEVICE, EXCELLENT PHONE, EXCELLENT CAMERA, FAIRLY GOOD PROCESSOR.  RAM COULD HAVE BEEN 2 GB."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AND RUNS LIKE A LAPTOP....SMOOTH AND NO GLITCHES..ITS A QUADCORE PROCESSOR.LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SPACE OF RAM...MICROMAX SHOULD INCREASE THE RAM FOR THEIR FORTHCOMING HANDSETS...NO COMPLAINTS..NO BAD FEELINGS...SUPER DUPER MOBILE....
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,CANVAS HD A116 IS A VERY GOOD MOBILE. I HAVE TWO MOBILES. BOTH ARE WORKING VERY SMOOTHLY. FLIPKART SERVICE IS VERY APPRECIATIVE ONE. UNFORTUNATELY THE SERVICE OF THE MICROMAX IS VERY POOR.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,DON'T SAY DON'T GO FOR MICROMAX.. I DON'T KNOW GUYS WHAT KIND OF MMX MOBILES  YOU ARE USING.I STARTED TO USE THIS MOBILE 7 MONTHS BACK.. TILL NOW I DIDN'T GET ANY SMALL OR BIG ISSUE WITH THIS MOBILE.. IT NEVER HANG OR LAG.. OTHER SONY OR SAMSUNG MOBILE BELOW 20000 CANT STAND NEAR TO THIS.. IF YOU ARE FACING A PROBLEM WITH CAMERA IT DUE TO LOW LIGHT ONLY.. CHECK WITH NIGHT MODE..
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"EXCELLENT PHONE UNDER THIS PRICE IF ANYONE PLANNING FOR BUYING , GO AHEAD ONLY ONE PROBLEM WHICH I HAVE NOTICED THAT TOUCH SENSIBILITY IS NOT SO GOOD, OTHERWISE VERY GOOD PHONE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"EXCELLENT PHONE UNDER THIS PRICE IF ANYONE PLANNING FOR BUYING , GO AHEAD ONLY ONE PROBLEM WICH I HAVE NOTICED THAT TOUCH SENSIBILITY IS NOT SO GOOD, OTHERWISE VERY GOOD PHONE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"FIRSTLY I BOUGHT THIS PHONE JUST AS A TEMPORARY PHONE TILL I COULD FIND A BETTER ONE. THE PRICE BEING ABOUT 13500 SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD BUY.
      
      BUT AFTER I RECEIVED THE PHONE I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED, IT LOOKED AND WORKED WAY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.
      
      
      MY EXPERIENCE AFTER USING THE PHONE FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. GREAT LOOKS
      
      2. LIGHT WEIGHT
      
      3. SUPER FAST ( QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AND 1GB RAM)
      
      4. DUAL SIM
      
      5. GOOD BATTERY LIFE ( LASTS 1 FULL DAY WITH 3G USAGE USING ONE SIM, HAVE NOT TESTED THE BATTERY WITH TWO SIMS)
      
      6. EXPANDABLE MEMORY TO 32GB ( I USE A 16GB MEMORY CARD WITH NO LAG AT ALL)
      
      7. AMAZING HD DISPLAY. BEATS THE LIKES OF GALAXY GRAND HANDS DOWN.
      
      8. GOOD SOUND QUALITY AND LOUDNESS
      
      9. HAS A SURPRISINGLY GOOD CAMERA. WORK A LITTLE ON THE SETTINGS AND YOU CAN WILL BE ABLE TO CLICK GREAT PICTURES AND VIDEOS.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      1) 1 GB INTERNAL SPACE FOR INSTALLING APPS. YOU CAN FIND APPS ON THE PLAY STORE THAT MOVE THE APP TO THE EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD. BUT WHEN YOU INSTALL AN APP OR UPDATE AN APP IT IS FIRST INSTALLED ON THE INTERNAL MEMORY. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN THE INTERNAL MEMORY YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EVEN UPDATE YOUR APPS.
      
      
      THIS ISSUE MIGHT BE ADDRESSED IN THE LATEST ANDROID UPDATE.
      
      
      2. THE LOUD SPEAKER DURING CALLS IS VERY CLEAR BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY LOUDER. CAN'T REALLY COUNT THIS AS A NEGATIVE BECAUSE IT COULD BE TO ALSO PREVENT THE SPEAKERS FROM GETTING SPOILED.
      
      
      3.NO TASK MANAGER. YOU HAVE TO INDIVIDUALLY KILL APPS. BUT YOU CAN GET A TASK MANAGER APP.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL IT IS A BRILLIANT PHONE. IF YOU CAN MANAGE WITH THE STORAGE ISSUE THEN THIS PHONE IS FOR YOU. I'M SURE THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF IN THE NEXT SOFTWARE UPDATE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"FLIPKART IS REALLY GOOD IN FAST SHIPPING AND BEHOOVE FOR APPRECIATION.. AS SAME THE PRODUCT WAS ALSO SHIPPED IN WELL CONDITION INCLUDING ALL THE ACCESSORIES MENTIONED AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, WELL PACKED IN GOOD MANNER...
      
      THE BATTERY WAS ALREADY CHARGED, I JUST NEED TO OPEN IT AND START IT WITH MY COMPANY WI-FI NETWORK, ITS STARTED AND WORKED WELL, STARTED DOWNLOADING SOME KNOWN GAMES AND CAPTURING FEW PICTURES WITH OFFICE COLLEAGUES AND ALL THINGS WORKING VERY WELL, PLAYED MY INTERESTED GAMES WITH EFFECTIVE CAPACITIVE TOUCH... EVERYTHING IS WORKING WELL AND MANAGED BEHAVIOR AND THIS PHONE IS AS GOOD AS I'VE LISTEN ABOUT IT AND USED BEFORE IN FRIENDS NETWORK...."

Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"GOOD POINTS-
      
      1. 1GB RAM &AMP; 1.2GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR , AWESOME GAMING, NEVER HANG
      
      2. AUDIO QUALITY WITH EARPHONES IS MIND BLOWING
      
      3. DISPLAY IS CRISP AND HD
      
      4. ALL TYPES OF VIDEOS PLAY WITHOUT ANY DISTURBANCE
      
      5. BATTERY IS A GOOD POINT IN THIS,IT WILL SURVIVE 1 DAY EVEN AFTER CONSTANT GAMING
      
      NOT SO GOOD POINTS-
      
      1. CAMERA IS NOT OF 8MP , IT IS HARDLY ABOUT 6MP, BUT NICE IF IT IS NOT YOUR NECESSARY POINT
      
      2. VIDEO RECORDING IS HD, SO IT CONTAIN MORE SPACE THAN YOU WILL IMAGINE
      
      3. INTERNAL MEMORY IS 1.7GB,WHICH IS LESS, BUT YOU CAN MANAGE THAT WITH EXTERNAL
      
      4. SCREEN GUARD GIVEN IS VERY VERY BAD, YOU WILL NEED A NEW ONE IN 1-2 WEEKS
      
      BESIDES ALL ITS 'NOT SO GOOD' POINT IT IS A GOOD DEAL , YOU WILL NEVER REGRET BUYING IT."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"GOOD RAM, CAMERA AND PROCESSOR.

      GOOD DISPLAY.
      
      GOOD BATTERY BACKUP AS COMPARED WITH SAMSUNG.
      
      
      BAD POINTS ARE CAMERA QUALITY IN HD MODE IS NOT SO GOOD. EAR-PIECE IS VERY DELICATE. WHITE CASE COVER GETS DIRTY IN FEW DAYS. BUT THESE ALL ARE PETTY ISSUES.
      
      
      OVER ALL 5 STARS (*****) TO FLIPCART AND 4.5 STARS TO THE PHONE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"GUYS IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY A SMART PHONE WITH LOW BUDGET GO FOR CANVAS HD.
      
      IT'S REALLY AWESOME. THE CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY GOOD. SO AS THE VIDEO RECORDING.
      
      YOU CAN EVEN THE CHANGE THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES AND VIDEO. BATTERY BACK UP WILL BE REALLY GOOD IF YOU USE LESS NUMBER OF APPS. PERFECT PHONE GAMING. GO FOR IT YOU WON'T REGRET."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE LAST 5 MONTHS, STILL NO PROBLEM. IT HAS A DECENT CAMERA, SPEAKER IS ALSO OK, DISPLAY IS GOOD( AT THIS PRICE). I USUALLY PLAY A LOT OF HD GAMES AND ALWAYS CONNECTED TO INTERNET, BUT THERE IS NO LAG. THE ONLY 2 PROBLEMS I FOUND THAT IT GETS HEAT UP AFTER PLAYING 10-15 MINS, AND BATTERY IS NOT VERY GOOD, HARDLY LAST A DAY. OTHERWISE THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR ME"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"I AM USING THIS PRODUCT FROM LAST 6 MONTHS, COMPARED IT MANY OTHER MOBILES. WORTH THE BUY.

      ITS A GOOD PHONE VALUE FOR MONEY WORKING LIKE CHARM AS IT IS NOW 7MONTH OLD STILL NO PROBLEM ,,AND GUYS IF U HAVE A BUDGET OF 14K THEN BUY MOTO G INSTEAD OF CANVAS HD AND YEAH IF U HAVE &GT;12K THEN GO FOR CANVAS HD A116I WHICH COST 10K IN FLIPKART AND THAT IS SAME AS A116
      
      ONLY THE NEGATIVE POINT OF THIS POINT IS THE BATTERY WORK FOR ONLY 5HOURS IF U USING IT OTHERWISE IT CAN MANAGE 2DAYS BUT IF U USING WIFI/NET CONTINUOUSLY IT CAN BE ONLY FOR 2-3HOURS :/"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY BRO, BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH FLIPKART. INITIALLY WHEN I RECEIVED IT, IT DECLARED ""DEAD ON ARRIVAL"". I GOT IT REPLACED IN FEW DAY AND IT IS WORKING GOOD SINCE THEN."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR OVER 9 MONTHS NOW...
      
      I AM THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. BUILD QUALITY IS AMAZING, DOESNT LAG AT ALL... I HAVE ALL COMMON APPS INSTALLED AND KEEP REMOVING AND ADDING APPS ON REGULAR BASIS, NEVER HAS IT SHOWN ANY ISSUES (FINGERS CROSSED).
      
      THE BEST PART WHICH I LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THAT IT COMES WITH STOCK ANDROID AND NO USER INTERFACE ADDED (WHICH COMMONLY IS DONE BY THE SONYS AND SAMSUNGS, HENCE EATING AWAY A PART OF RAM)... IN COMPARISON TO S3, THIS PHONE BEATS IT HANDS DOWN (I AM TALKING ON PRACTICAL PURPOSES, HAVE DONE MANY COMPARISONS WITH MY FRIENDS' S3S)"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM 6 MONTHS AND TRUST ME I HAVEN'T FACED ANY PROBLEM WITH IT TILL NOW.IT HAS A SHARP DISPLAY WITH GOOD COLOR EFFECTS.CAMERA IF FINE(REAR AND FRONT),TOUCH IS AWESOME,HUGE SCREEN,NICE BUILT.MOST IMPORTANTLY,I AM PLAYING ALL 3D GAMES ON IT WITHOUT ANY LAG,SAY IT NFS MOST WANTED,ASPHALT 7,MODERN COMBAT 4,FIFA 12 OR ANY OTHER GAME,U WON'T FIND ANY PROBLEM AND IT WILL RUN SMOOTHLY.IF YOU CAN GO AWAY FROM A WELL ESTABLISHED BRAND LIKE SAMSUNG,SONY AND OTHERS THEN TRUST ME THIS MACHINE IS FOR YOU(ESPECIALLY FOR GAME LOVERS)."

Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE MORE THAN 2 MONTHS...... BELIEVE ME GUYS THERE IS NO PROBLEM WAT SO EVER.
      
      
      I USE IT FOR NET (2G SPEED ALWAYS ON) / GAMES / FB / WATCH TUTORIALS FOR 1 HR A DAY (IN MY CAB) / GOOD NUMBER OF CALLS  AND THE BATTERY LASTS EASILY THROUGH OUT THE DAY. ITS TRUE THAT U HAV TO CHARGE IT ONCE U REACH HOME BACK FROM OFFICE. BUT IT REALLY KEEPS U ON FOR 10 HRS WITH HEAVY USAGE.
      
      
      AND THERE IS NO PROBLEM WAT SO EVER REGARDING HANGING. I HAVE NOT SEEN HANGING ISSUES EVEN ONCE TILL NOW IN MY PHONE. PHONE COMES OUT WITH JELLYBEAN 4.2.1 VERSION OUT OF THE BOX AND THERE IS RUMORS THAT MMX IS PLANNING TO RELEASE A 4.3 UPDATE FOR THIS PHONE WHICH IS JUST GREAT!
      
      
      IF U ASK ME..... GO FOR IT WITH UR EYES CLOSED. TOTALLY WORTH IT.

Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THIS PHONE BEFORE I WAS ON JELLYBEAN 4.1.2... AND THEN I UPDATED IT TO JELLYBEAN 4.2.1... THE PHONE BECAME A ROCKSTART EVERSINCE...

Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,"MICROMAX CANVAS HD A116 IS AN AWESOME BUY AT THIS PRICE. I LIKED THE PART WHERE IT GAVE ME THE OPTION TO PAY THE TOTAL PRICE IN 12 EMI'S WITH NO EXTRA CHARGES.

IT'S COMPETITOR IS SAMSUNG S3 WHICH IS AROUND 23K BUT THIS IS AROUND 13 TO 15K. SLIM SLEEKY DESIGN, QUIT HANDY. NO PROBLEMS. AND I SHOULD MENTION IT HERE THAT I DID ROOTED IT.

Micromax Canvas HD A116,5,VERY GOOD MOBILE. PRICE IS ALSO GOOD. WORTH THE MONEY SPENT. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THE BATTERY BACK UP.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"AFTER HAVING USED THE PHONE FOR 2 WEEKS, I MUST WRITE A REVIEW TO HELP OTHERS IN DILEMMA. FIRST OF ALL, DON'T PURCHASE IT FROM FLIPKART, AS AFTER GOOD BARGAINING, I WAS ABLE TO GET IT FOR RS 11300. AND OH, IF YOU GET THE OPTION OF EXTRA 1 YEAR WARRANTY, DO TAKE IT. IT MAY COST 1.2K EXTRA, BUT WILL BE HELPFUL LATER IF YOUR PHONE IS DAMAGED. WITH MICROMAX, WE CAN'T REALLY TAKE CHANCES.
      
      NOW I WILL COME TO THE MAIN POINT. CANVASHD IS A REALLY GOOD PHONE FROM MICROMAX, CONSIDERING I GOT IT FOR 11300. WHAT'S EXCELLENT THAT THEY PROVIDE A COMPLIMENTARY FLIP COVER WITHIN THE BOX, SO NO NEED TO SHELL OUT EXTRA 400 BUCKS. ALSO THE TOUCHSCREEN IS 1280X720 IPS LCD WITH GREAT VIEWING ANGLES, AND SHARP CONTRAST. COLORS LOOK ALMOST REAL, AND IT'S SENSITIVE TOO. WHAT'S BETTER, IT IS PROTECTED WITH A GLASS LAYER(NOT GORILLA GLASS...:P), SO IT'S UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU WANT TO BUY A SCREEN GUARD OR NOT. IT HAS A 1.2 GHZ QUAD CORE CORTEX A7 ARMV7 CPU, ON A MEDIATTEK MTK6589 SOC. YEAH I KNOW IT'S NOT SO GOOD BUT SEE THE PRICE GUYS. IT ALSO HAS A POWERVR SGX 544MP GPU CLOCKED AT 286 MHZ. IT SCORES 13600 IN ANTUTU, AROUND 4500 IN QUADRANT STANDARD AND 46.4FPS IN NENAMARK2, ALL UPDATED TO THE LATEST VERSION. BUT THERE'S A CATCH HERE. THE CPU AND GPU ARE CAPABLE OF PLAYING HIGH-END GAMES BUT IT IS THE MEDIATEK CHIPSET THAT BOTTLE-NECKS. HAD IT BEEN A QUALCOMM CHIPSET, THE PHONE WOULD HAVE FLIED.
      
      THE CAMERA IS ABOVE AVERAGE, AND IT IS REALLY WOTH COMPLIMENTING IN HDR MODE. IT CAPTURES 1080P(THAT'S THE FINE MODE IN VIDEO SETTINGS. HIGH STANDS FOR 720P) BUT EVEN A 2 MINUTE VIDEO REQUIRES 110 MB SPACE. THE 4 GB INTERNAL MEMORY, OF WHICH YOU GET 1.7 GB IS TOO LOW. IN LOW LIGHT THE CAMERA JUST MANAGES TO DO AVERAGE WITH THE AVERAGE FLASH. THE FRONT CAMERA IS OKAY FOR SELF PICS AND VIDEO CALLS.
      
      THE PHONE SUPPORTS DUAL SIM. THE CALL QUALITY IS ABOVE AVERAGE, BUT THE PHONE DOES GET REALLY HOT IF YOU TALK MORE THAN 10 MINUTES. THE SPEAKER IS LOCATED AT THE BACK, AND IS NOT VERY LOUD. IN FACT, IT IS REALLY BAD. YOU ARE LIKELY TO MISS SOME CALLS IN MARKETS OR CROWDED PLACES.
      
      MUSIC QUALITY IS NOT SO GOOD, BUT WITH HEADPHONES IT'S NICE. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY MICROMAX HAS PROVIDED WITH SIMPLE ON-EAR EARPHONES, WHEN EVEN A 6K MOBILE COMES WITH IN-EAR.
      
      IT HAS 1GB RAM, SO NO PROBLEM IN DEMANDING GAMES LIKE ASPHALT 7, GTA VICE CITY, NFS MOST WANTED ETC.. HOWEVER ASPHALT 8 IS NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED ON MEDIATEK DEVICES, SO YOU WON'T SEE IT ON PLAY STORE. MEDIUM GAMES LIKE SUBWAY SURFERS, TEMPLE RUN, FRUIT NINJA ETC WORK FLAWLESSLY.
      
      THE BIGGEST PROBLEM HOWEVER, IS THAT IT HAS A MERE 2000MAH BATTERY. CONSIDERING THE 5'' SCREEN AND THE AMOUNT OF PIXELS IT HAS TO RENDER, IT CONSUMES BATTERY LIKE A FAMISHED DOG CONSUMES IT FOOD. ADD TO THAT THE TEMPTATION OF PLAYING GAMES, AND YOUR PHONE WILL BARELY LAST 8 HOURS ON A FULL CHARGE. I RECOMMEND KEEPING THE BRIGHTNESS AT LOWEST IF YOU WANT THE CHARGE TO LAST AT LEAST A DAY.
      
      
      OVERALL, CANVASHD IS A GOOD PHONE, AND I WILL SURELY RECOMMEND IT, CONSIDERING YOU GET IT WITHIN 12000. IF NOT, THEN DO CONSIDER LAVA IRIS 504Q, OR SHELL OUT ANOTHER 1.5K AND BUY XPERIA M."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"ALL SPECS ARE ALREADY DISCUSSED ABOVE.
      
      
      IN A NUTSHELL - FOR AN AVERAGE USER - IF YOU CAN KEEP UR PHONE FROM FALLING DOWN AND CAN LIVE WITH HALF-A-DAY BATTERY LIFE. THIS IS THE BEST DEAL FOR ANDROID PHONES IN 12-14K RANGE.
      
      
      LOOKS FAB AND WORKS FINE. NOT A STURDY BUILD AND PRETTY CHEAP STOCK EARPHONES.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, QUAD CORE+ 1GB RAM AND 5 INCH HD DISPLAY FOR 13.3K WAS A REAL DEAL !!"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"AWESOME MOBILE... EXCELLENT CONFIGURATION AT A LESS PRICE... SOUND QUALITY IS NOT SO GOOD AND IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE ABOUT THE PRODUCT...
      
      
      FASTEST DELIVERY BY FLIPKART. DELIVERED THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER I PLACED THE ORDER. MIGHT HAVE BEEN PACKED BETTER..."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"AWESOME PHONE BUT CAPTURED IMAGES GOT FADE WHILE ZOOM IN..
      
      WHILE PLAYING LIVE CHANNEL, PICTURE IS NOT CLEAR.
      
      EXCLUDING ALL THESE, THIS PHONE IS OUTSTANDING FEAURES.
      
      GO FOR IT..."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"BEEN USING HD FOR 3 MONTHS. WHEN I MADE AN ORDERER, IT HIT A SURPRISING LOW OF RS. 11.5K, MAYBE COZ CANVAS 4 WAS TO BE ANNOUNCED. LATER NOTICED THAT IT HAS A VERY UNNOTICEABLE CRACK ON THE METALLIC LINING AROUND IT, MAYBE THAT'S WHY I GOT IT CHEAP AS THE PRICE WAS AGAIN 13.5K THE VERY NEXT DAY.
      
      EVERYONE ELSE HAS SPOKEN HIGHLY OF ITS CAM, PROCESSOR, GRAPHICS AND LOOKS. I FULLY AGREE EVERY BIT. NEVER SO FAR THIS PHONE HAS DISAPPOINTED IN ANY WAY. NEITHER FOR BASIC FUNCTIONALITY, NOR WHILE MULTI TASKING DID I EVER FACE ANY LAG OR MALFUNCTIONING.
      
      HAVE DROPPED IT A FEW TIMES, STILL NO ISSUES.
      
      I HAVE WHITE MODEL (AS THE BLACK ONE COSTED ME 13.5K), AND IT LOST ITS SHEEN AND LUSTRE PRETTY QUICK (JUST THE OUTER BODY, NOT THE SCREEN WHICH I HAVE WELL PROTECTED BY A SCREENGUARD).
      
      THE MATTE FINISH OF BACK COVER MAKES IT A PLEASURE TO HOLD.
      
      
      IF I FORCIBLY FIND A SHORTCOMING IN THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART PRODUCT FROM MMX, I WOULD POINT OUT TO ITS BATTERY WHICH BARELY LASTS FOR ONE DAY OF EVEN A LOW MODERATE USE IN OFFICE.
      
      AND IF THEY COULD COMPLEMENT THE SUPERB VIDEO WITH EVEN A NEARLY DECENT AUDIO, IT WOULD'VE BEEN A STEAL. ALAS, ONE HAS TO COMPROMISE ON THE LOUDNESS OF THE PHONE. THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT, THE VOLUME ISN'T THAT GOOD.
      
      
      OVERALL FOR ME, IT'S PROVED TO BE A NICE BUY AS I GOT IT A COUPLE THOUSANDS CHEAPER THAN WHAT YOU GUYS WILL HAVE TO PAY ;-)
      
      MY FRIEND USES IT NOW, AND HE'S REAL BAD AT THE TOUCHES (HE PREVIOUSLY USED RECEPTIVE TOUCH PHONES). SURPRISINGLY, IT SURVIVED HIS HARSH APPROACH TOWARDS IT FOR MONTHS.. SO LETS ADD THAT THIS IS ALSO DURABLY DESIGNED TO LAST FOR A WHILE.
      
      
      JUST BOUGHT A MMX PHONE WORTH RS.999!! AND I THINK IT'S A STEAL TOO.."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"BEST BARGAIN AND EXCELLENT DELIVERY TIME.
      
      GOOD PHONE, THOUGH LAGS THE SMOOTHNESS IT SHOULD HAVE.
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS OK OK...BUT SHOULD NOT EXPECT MUCH FROM ANDROID PHONES WITH BIG SCREENS.
      
      
      IN ALL, A GOOD PURCHASE."

      HERE ARE MY QUICK REVIEWS
      
      
      WHY TO BUY?
      
      1. FLIPKART PRICING :- RS.1500 LESS THAN MARKET PRICE (10/10)
      
      2. VERY GOOD BUILT QUALITY ( CHEAP, RIDICULOUS ETC IN OTHER REVIEW SITES ARE BULLSHIT) (9/10)
      
      3. SUPERB SCREEN QUALITY ( WILL STAND TOGETHER OR EVEN BEAT SAMSUNG/HTC/LG 22K RANGE SETS) (9/10)

      5. ONE FLIPCOVER &AMP; A REDUNDANT BACK COVER IN THE BOX (9/10)
      
      
      WHY NOT TO BUY?
      
      1. SPEAKER SOUND IS TOO LOW (1/10)
      
      2. NO MEMORY CARDS COMES ALONG WITH THE BOX (1/10)
      
      3. TOO MUCH OF CUSTOMIZATION DONE BY MICROMAX AND MOST OF THE PRE INSTALLED APPS ARE WASTE AND CANNOT BE UNINSTALLED. (WHICH EATS SOME GOOD PART OF YOUR INTERNAL MEMORY). (0/10)
      
      4. BATTERY BACK UP (CHARGED 6 HRS AND BATTERY SUDDENLY DOWNS TO 75% WITHIN 10 MNS)
      
      5. CAMERA  FLASH (MMX HAS TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY HAVE PROVIDED A FLASH. INFACT YOU HAVE TO LIGHT ANOTHER TORCH TO SEE WHETHER THE FLASH IS WORKING OR NOT) (2/10)
      
      6. CAMERA (REALLY BAD QUALITY) A 5 MP OF SAMSUNG GALAXY ACE DOES 100 TIMES BETTER THAN 8MP CANVAS HD CAMERA"

Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"HELLO EVERYONE... I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER 2 N A HALF MONTHS OF SATISFIED EXPERIENCE WITH THIS STAR OF THE CANVAS FAMILY.
      
      I WON'T DISCUSS THE SPECS AT ALL... I WOULD ONLY LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS PHONE HAS BEEN WORKING GREAT FOR ME N HAS GIVEN ME A SMOOTH PERFORMANCE FOR THE PAST 2 N A HALF MONTHS...BE IT THE PROCESSING SPEED OR THE CRISP DISPLAY, BE IT THE AMAZING RESOLUTION OR THE PICTURE CLARITY, THIS PHONE COMES WITH THE BEST.
      
      BUT YEAH I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER IF THE CAMERA HAD BEEN A TOUCH BETTER...AS I FEEL THIS IS A VERY GOOD 5MP CAM N NOT 8MP ONE(PERSONAL OPINION), PLUS THE SPEAKER SOUND IS A LIL ON THE LOWER SIDE AND YES THE BATTERY....IT SURPRISES ME WITH ITS BATTERY LIFE ON D DAYS IT IS USED MODERATELY N GIVES ME AROUND 10-11 HRS OF PERFORMANCE... U USE IT MORE, AS IN PLAY GAMES CONTINUOUSLY OR WATCH VIDEOS AT A STRETCH THEN U DEFINITELY HAVE TO PLUG IN THE CHARGER SOONER THAN THE SPECIFIED HOURS OF USAGE.
      
      ALL IN ALL CANVAS HD PROVIDES ME PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I EXPECT AND WANT FROM A SMARTPHONE.. N GUYS WHATS BETTER IF U GET IT AT THIS PRICE... TOUCHWOOD...!!!
      
      AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING THE PHONE WITHOUT MAKING ME WAIT MUCH :) :)"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"HI ALL,
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS HANDSET FOR MY WIFE FROM FLIPKART. FLIPKART DELIVERED IT AS EXPECTED. INITIALLY WE WERE SO SCARED TO GO WITH MICROMAX BRAND DUE ITS SERVICE RELATED CONCERNS BUT THEN WE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AS THE COST AND SPECS WERE GOOD. I WON'T PLAY MUCH OF GAMES WITH IT BUT I TESTED EACH AND EVERY FUNCTIONALITY OF THE MOBILE. I WILL JUST COMMENT ON MY USAGE AND OBSERVATIONS.
      
      
      SOME OF THE HANDSETS I USED BEFORE THIS WERE HEATING UP WHEN I USE WI-FI TETHERING. BUT THIS HANDSET OUT PERFORMS IN THIS CONTEXT. CAMERA IS JUST AVERAGE. I DON'T ENJOY THE CAMERA QUALITY OF THIS HANDSET BUT I AM ABLE TO TAKE SOME GOOD SNAPS DURING DAY LIGHT CONDITIONS.
      
      
      MICROMAX SMARTPHONES BATTERY JUST LAST ONE DAY MAX AS I HAVE CHECKED ALL MOST ALL THE SPECS OF MOBILES AND DISCUSSED WITH FRIENDS.
      
      
      I WAS UNABLE TO TEST SKYPE FUNCTIONALITY ON THIS MOBILE AS IT DIDN'T WORK. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS A HANDSET ISSUE. IT MAY BE AN ISSUE WITH CONFIGURATION OR MAY BE MY 3G NETWORK. I WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE OTHER PERSON BUT THEY CAN SEE ME WITH MY 2 MP FRONT CAMERA. HOWEVER IF YOU USE THIS FEATURE HEAVILY, THEN DON'T DEPEND ON MY REVIEW.
      
      
      PROS
      
      
      1) ALL MOST ALL FUNCTIONALITY WORKS WITH NO ISSUES. NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL.
      
      2) BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      
      IMPROVEMENTS (NOT CONS) :
      
      
      1) TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT AS GREAT AS SAMSUNG OR LG BUT NO ISSUES AT ALL. RESPONSE IS GOOD.
      
      2) BATTERY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED. IT LASTS FOR ONE DAY MAX.
      
      3) CAMERA IS AVERAGE. YOU CAN CLICK SOME GOOD PICS IN DAY LIGHT. BUT DON'T COMPARE IT WITH SAMSUNG OR LG 8 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA.
      
      4) I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR ANYTHING. BUT STILL I BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO IMPROVE IN THIS AREA.
      
      
      OVERALL I WILL RECOMMEND THIS MOBILE AS IT IS VALUE FOR MONEY."

      - SOUND SYSTEM :- DON'T COMPARE WITH OTHER SMART PHONE, VIA EAR PHONES IT'S GOOD.
      
      
      - INTERNAL MEMORY :- NOT ENOUGH, HOPE IT WILL BE RESOLVED WHEN I UPGRADE TO 4.2.2
      
      
      - GAMES &AMP; APPS :- NO LOGGING, NO STUCK [BUT YOU CAN NOT INSTALL BIG GAMES OR APPS BCZ USER AVAILABLE INTERNAL MEMORY IS 1.77GB].
      
      
      - OTHERS :- YOU  CAN NOT SYNC CONTACTS WITH FB, BUT IT WORKS FOR GOOGLE+ AND OTHERS.
      
      
      INBUILT MMX APPS SUCK.
      
      
      IF YOU LOVE PLAYING GAMES, DON'T GO FOR THIS PHONE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN APRIL AND IT IS ALMOST PERFECT EXCEPT THAT IT HAS NO MAGNETIC COMPASS, SO ON MAPS, YOU WILL ALWAYS POINT NORTH. ALSO YOU NEED TO USE LOCATION ENGINEER MODE AND ASSISTANT GPS TO LOCATE POSITION.
      
      
      WOULD HAVE MINDED PAYING A THOUSAND EXTRA IF THE PHONE CAME WITH THESE FEATURES."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR 12600 AFTER 10% CASHBACK ON CREDIT CARD WITH 6 EMIS...AND PERFORMANCE OF MOBILE IS GOOD..OVER ALL HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,I BROUGHT THIS PHONE SIX MONTHS AGO AND I FEEL IT IS A GREAT PHONE.  DISPLAY IS AWESOME WITH GOOD BATTERY LIFE.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I FOUND IT FULLY LOADED ONE.. :), HOWEVER BUYING IT FROM FLIPKART WAS ALSO NICE EXPERIENCE, AS I GET DETAILS OF MY PRODUCT IN WEBSITE ITSELF. BECAUSE I GIFTED IT TO ONE OF MY RELATIVE, FLIPKART PROVIDES OPTIONS OF GIFT WRAP ALSO FOR JUST RS. 30.
      
      
      LOOKING FOR NICE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE AHEAD."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR PAST 5 MONTHS. IT'S A GOOD PHONE FOR THIS PRICE RANGE. THERE ARE SOME GLITCHES WHILE USING IT. GPS IS NOT AT ALL NEAR TO ACCURATE. THE TOUCH SCREEN DOESN'T WORK SOMETIMES. THERE IS NO OPTION TO ENABLE 3G/WIFI WHEN THE SCREEN IS LOCKED.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS NEW MOBILE MICROMAX CANVAS HD A116 FOR FEW MONTHS NOW AND I AM HAPPY WITH ITS PERFORMANCE. THERE ARE NO ISSUES AND RUNS SMOOTHLY.
      
      
      ALL HD VIDEOS RUN WELL AND THERE IS NO PIX-ELATION ON FAST MOVING IMAGES.
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS DECENT AND ALSO DEPENDS ON INDIVIDUAL USAGE.
      
      ALL THE FEATURES WHICH WE HAVE ON A HIGH END SMART PHONE, WE GET ALL THOSE IN THIS PHONE AT BEST PRICE.
      
      
      DRAWBACK OF THIS PHONE IS, OTHER EAR PHONES DO NOT WORK WELL, EAR PHONES WHICH COMES WITH THE BOX ONLY WORK AND IT IS NOT OF GOOD QUALITY."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT 3-4 MONTHS NOW AND IT WORKS WITHOUT ANY LAGS/GLITCHES. FULLY SATISFIED WITH PERFORMANCE, THE DISPLAY AND EVEN THE CAMERA QUALITY. BEST PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE WITH MUCH BETTER SPECS THAN RIVALS SUCH AS SAMSUNG/SONY."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR SOMETIME NOW AND I FIND IT PERFECT FOR THE PRICE AND THE USE FOR WHICH THE PHONE WAS BOUGHT. THE PHONE SCREEN IS BIG AND NICE. IT HAS A SLIGHT FLICKER TO IT IF YOU WATCH CLOSELY BUT THAT IS NOT NOTICEABLE AND HENCE VIDEOS AND PHOTOS COME OUT GOOD.
      
      
      CAMERA IS ACCEPTABLE AND THE FRONT CAMERA IS HO-HUM, WHICH I DO NOT USE ANYWAYS. THE PHONE FUNCTION IS QUITE GOOD AND THE VOICE CLARITY IS QUITE GOOD TOO.
      
      
      ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT SOMETIMES THE PROXIMITY SENSOR DECIDES TO WAKE UP THE SCREEN EVEN WHEN THE CALL IS ON AND THIS CAUSES A PHONE DISCONNECT BECAUSE THE CHEEK TOUCHES THE CALL END BUTTON ON THE SCREEN. THIS IS AN INFREQUENT PROBLEM AND MIGHT ALSO BE ATTRIBUTED TO  ANGLE OF HOLDING THE PHONE CLOSE TO THE EAR OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT IS NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM, SINCE FOR IMPORTANT CALLS I CAN MANUALLY SHUTOFF THE SCREEN AND TALK. THE AUTO-BRIGHTNESS MODE DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK VERY WELL SINCE IT IT NEVER SURE WHETHER TO DIM IT A LITTLE OR BRIGHT IT UP A LITTLE AND ENDS UP TOGGLING BETWEEN A LITTLE DIM AND A LITTLE BRIGHT BUT THAT TOO IS MINOR ISSUE FOR ME. A COUPLE OF TIMES THE PHONE FELL ON THE FLOOR BUT HAS NOT SUSTAINED ANY DAMAGE.
      
      
      THE SCREEN TOUCH IS NOT AMONG THE BEST BUT NOT AMONG THE WORST EITHER. IT S QUITE GOOD AND IS IN PERFECT WORKING CONDITION EVEN AFTER PUTTING A SCRATCH GUARD. ONE OF MY MAJOR GROUSE IS THE LACK OF ENOUGH MEMORY WHERE I CAN PUT APPS. 3 OR 4 BIG GAMES CAUSE THE MEMORY TO RUN OUT.
      
      
      OVERALL QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT AT THE PRICE WHICH I BOUGHT."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE ALMOST 8 MONTSH BACK..I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR QUITE LONG..
      
      THE ONLY ISSUE I HAD IS THE BOTTOM OF THE TOCUH SCREEN WAS NOT WORKING..
      
      I WAS LAZY TO GO TO SERVICE CENTER AND NOW IT WORKS ON ITS OWN..
      
      THE PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR DAILYUSAGE..
      
      I WOULD SAY NOW PEOPLE SHOULD GO FOR MAGNUS.. ITS FASTER AND BETTER THEN THIS"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,I HAVE PURCHASE MICROMAX CANVAS HD A116 IS 06/05/2103 AFTER PURCHASE IN SIX MONTH MY FRONT VOICE SPEKAR IS  TWO TIME CREK FRONT VOICE SPEKAR IS BAD QUALITY BUT THIS DEVISE VERY WELL. DEVISE PROCESSOR  AND CAMERA QUALITY  IS VERY GOOD.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I ORDERED IT FROM FLIPKART BY PAYING 13699 THOUGH IT WAS AVAILABLE AT 12999 ON EBAY. ITEM WAS DELIVERED VERY QUICKLY AS EXPECTED.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. AMAZING PERFORMANCE
      
      2. JELLYBEAN IS A MAGIC.
      
      3. VERY SLIM AND GOOD FORM FACTOR.
      
      4. AVAILABLE IN FULL BLACK (FRONT AND BACK).
      
      5. 2000 MAH IS JUST SUFFICIENT TO POWER THE QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AND LIGHT UP 5"" DISPLAY.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. BUILD QUALITY IS NOT UP TO THE MARK.
      
      2. SCREEN COLOR REPRODUCTION IS NOT THAT GREAT.
      
      3. DISPLAY SOMETIMES FEELS FLICKERING (VERY RARE).
      
      4. I HEARD THAT WARRANTY AND SERVICE OF MICROMAX IS PATHETIC.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ANDROID PHONE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 12K TO 13K CANVAS HD IS THE PHONE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I ORDERED THIS MOBILE IN FLIPKART .. THEY DELIVERED IT NEXT DAY ITSELF .. VERY FAST DELIVERY.
      
      
      MICROMAX HAS EMERGED AS THIRD LARGEST MANUFACTURER OF MOBILE PHONES IN INDIA. THEIR CANVAS SERIES HAS BECOME HUGE SUCCESS STORY. WITH CANVAS HD THIS SUCCESS CONTINUES."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I ORDERED THIS PHONE FROM THE WEBSITE AND GOT IT QUICK. NOW, I'VE USED THIS PHONE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND IT HAS RARELY LAGGED.
      
      I HAVE RUN HEAVY APPS LIKE THE ASPHALT 8 OF 1.5GBS AND TEMPLE RUN 2. BOTH THESE GAMES RUM EXTREMELY SMOOTH.
      
      IT HAS AN AWESOME CAMERA WHICH CLICKS HIGH DEFINITION AND CLEAR PICTURES.
      
      THE VIDEO RECORDING IS CLEAR ALTHOUGH THE VIDEOS MAY HAVE A GREATER SIZE.
      
      1080P VIDEOS RUN GREAT ON THE DEVICE WITHOUT LAGGING.
      
      THE MUSIC QUALITY IT OK BUT CLEAR. THE EARPHONES PROVIDED ARE NOT SO GOOD BUT WE CAN ALWAYS HAVE SOME GOOD ONES! A PHILIPS WOULD DO.
      
      THE FIRST TIME YOU RUN GAMES WITH SIZE 1.5GB OR MORE, IT MAY LAG A BIT. BUT THATS ONLY FOR THE FIRST TIME.
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS OK BUT CAN IT FOR ABOUT 12HRS. THIS WAS NOT BAD WITH MY ROUGH USAGE AND IT IS DURABLE.
      
      
      A GOOD EFFORT BY MICROMAX. IT'S ACTUALLY NOTHING LIKE ANYTHING..!!!"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I PURCHASED MICROMAX A116 CANVAS HD MOBILE. IT IS REALLY VALUE FOR MONEY. MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES USE HIGH END SAMSUNG PHONES AND IPHONE. BUT, SEEING THE PERFORMANCE OF MY PHONE, THEY SAY IT IS JUST VALUE FOR MONEY. NO DOUBT, IT'S CAMERA QUALITY IS FANTASTIC. TOUCH SENSITIVE NESS IS SUPERB. QUICKNESS OF CONNECTIVITY WITH WIFI AND NETWORK IS ALSO SUPERB. TOTALLY IT IS A GOOD BUY."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I PURCHASED THIS SMART PHONE BEFORE 1 MONTH,AND I FEEL THIS IS A GOOD SMART PHONE WITH A GOOD BUDGET, TILL NOW I DIDN'T GET ANY SINGLE ISSUE ON THIS PHONE, IF YOU WANT TO GET SAME FEATURES ON HIGHLY BRANDED PHONES

THIS CELL IS UP TO MARK WITH GUD PRICE RANGE. HVNG AWSM HD EXPERIENCE USING IT... ALL FEATURES R GOOD. CAMERA AGAIN IMPROVED BY LAST VERSION WITH LED FLASH... EXCELLENT BATTERY BACK UP.... SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I WANTED TO BUY A DECENT SMART PHONE WITH GOOD HARDWARE WITH LIMITED BUDGET. I IMMEDIATELY ZEROED ONTO THIS PHONE. BUT THE PRICE WAS LITTLE HIGH (13845) FOR MY LIMITED BUDGET.  I WAITED  UNTIL DEEWALI OFFER, GOT 1000 OFF AND THEN ON STANDARD CHARTERED CREDIT CARD GOT ANOTHER 10% OFF. COMING TO PHONE, THE BUILD IS NOT REALLY GOOD, GETTING A CASE WILL HELP YOU OUT. SPEAKERS ARE NOT GOOD, I HAD SEINHEISSER HEADPHONES, SO NOT A PROBLEM. BATTERY DRAINS REALLY FAST WHEN GAMES ARE PLAYED. OTHERWISE, BATTERY BACKUP COMES ATLEAST A COUPLE OF DAYS. EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS PERFECTLY, NO HANGS, VIDEO QUALITY IS GOOD.  I WOULD SAY, IT WAS A DECENT BUY FOR THE PRICE I PAID."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,I WAS USING PHONE AROUND 1 MONTH .REALLY FEATURE OF PHONE IS VERY GOOD .NO ANY PROBLEM FACED . PROCESSOR IS WORKING VERY GOOD. BUT CAMERA AND SOUND IS NOT UPTO THE MARK .IF COMPARE WITH PRICES .ALL THINGS EXCELLENT
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIME USER LIKE ME . THEN I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR 3-4 MONTHS NOW  WITHOUT ANY ISSUE. THE BEST IS THE PRICE IS WHICH IS VERY COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER PHONE .
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,I'M USING THIS FROM THE LAST FEW DAYS...THE PERFORMANCE IS NICE AS OF NOW... I CAN SAY IT'S GOOD PRODUCT FROM THE MICROMAX.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"INITIALLY I WAS CONSIDERING MICROMAX IS NOT A GOOD BRAND TO BUY.
      
      BUT THEN I THOUGHT, THEY ARE GETTING ALL ELECTRONICS HARDWARE FROM SOME STANDARD COMPANIES ASSEMBLING IT, INSTALLING ANDROID AND SELLING. SO, THE PLASTIC BODY IS OF MICROMAX, EVERYTHING ELSE IS BOUGHT OUT.
      
      ITS SAME AS AN ASSEMBLED PC. ALL OF THEM USE STANDARD HARDWARE, INSTALL WINDOWS 7 AND SELL IT. THE ASSEMBLED PC RUNS AS FINE AS A BRANDED PC LIKE DELL OR COMPAQ.
      
      SO I BOUGHT IT. AND TO MY WONDER, THE PHONE RUNS SMOOTHLY, NO LAGS NO DELAY, EXCELLENT DISPLAY, ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUES (NEVER HANGS), THE BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO GOOD (AS I DONT USE 3G) CAMERA IS PRETTY AVERAGE. REST ALL IS JUST PERFECT.
      
      I'M USING IT FOR 3 MONTHS, ABSOLUTELY LOVING IT.
      
      INSTEAD OF INVESTING 30K ON BRANDED MOBILE, I GOT EVERYTHING IN THIS PHONE FOR 13.5K (AND WITH THE REST OF THE MONEY SAVED, I BOUGHT OTHER USEFUL THINGS!!)"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"ITS A AWESOME PHONE
      
      GOOD CAMERA QUALITY

Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"ITS AN AMAZING PHONE BY MICROMAX. AND I WASN'T EXPECTING FLIP COVER ALONG WITH PRODUCT BUT I GOT. THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO BY BRAND THIS IS BEST FOR THEM. I M USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST MONTHS ITS NEVER UPSET ME IT DOESN'T HANG OR LAG AT ALL, NICE VIDEO QUALITY AMAZING SCREEN SMOOTHNESS ONLY EARPHONE I DON'T LIKE ITS VERY CHEAP BUT WE CAN HAVE GOOD 1 FROM THE SHOP I RECOMMEND TO ALL MY FRIEND FOR CANVAS HD A116"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,I'VE HAD THE MMX A116 FOR THE PAST 8 MONTHS TILL IT GOT STOLEN . I FELT IT WAS QUITE GOOD . TRIED A CHEAPER PHONE FROM THEIR COMPETITOR AND HAD A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE . EXTREMELY GOOD PHONE FOR ITS PRICE RANGE EXCEPT FOR CAMERA .
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"I'VE WAITED FOR A MONTH TO WRITE THIS REVIEW AS I WANTED TO MAKE JUSTICE TO THE PHONE.
      
      AT FIRST GLANCE, I LIKED THE PHONE PRETTY MUCH. THE 5'' SCREEN IS AWESOME. THE HD VIDEOS LOOK CRISP &AMP; PLAY WITHOUT ANY HASSLE.
      
      THE SOUND QUALITY OF SPEAKERS IS AVERAGE, BUT ACCEPTABLE.
      
      THE CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT PICTURES LOOK GRAINY ON ZOOM.
      
      ALL IN ALL, VALUE FOR MONEY AS U WILL SELDOM LOOK PAST THAT GLORIOUS BIG SCREEN.
      
      SCREEN 4.5/5
      
      SOUND 2.5/5
      
      CAMERA 3/5
      
      USER FRIENDLINESS 3/5
      
      ALL IN ALL 3.5/5
      
      ALSO HATS OFF TO FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING THE PHONE WITHING 48 HOURS"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"MICROMAX CANVAS HD IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND OFFERS ALL THE CONFIGURATION OF A HIGH BUDGET PHABLET,ITS SCREEN RESOLUTION IS JUST AWESOME BUT LACKS WHEN IT COMES TO THE PLASTIC MATERIAL USED FOR THE OUTER PANEL,I SHALL GIVE IT 8/10."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"MICROMAX HAS A SUCH GREAT PRODUCT DISPLAY IS TO GOOD, INTERNET BROWSING IS TO GOOD,
      
      BATTERY BACK UP IS TO MUCH LOW FOR 3G USE"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,MOBILE IS GOOD BUT NOT TOO GOOD. I AM USING SUMSUNG NOTE 2 . IF YOU WANT THIS MOBILE THEN BUY SECOND HAND SUMSUNG NOTE 2. YOU WILL BE HAPPY
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"MY NEW PHONE MICROMAX CANVAS HD, SUITABLY PRICED, IS THE BEST PHONE I COULD HAVE GOT AND BETTER STILL, FLIPKART WAS SELLING IT WITH AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR ONE YEAR. MY ONLY WORRY COULD HAVE BEEN THE DEPENDABILITY OF THE COMPANY MICROMAX BUT WITH THIS EXTRA OFFER IT HAS MADE UP WELL. QUALITY OF VIDEO IS QUIET GOOD AND PEOPLE GET SURPRISED AND MAKE ME FEEL OVERWHELMED. PHOTO QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD. LIVING MORE THAN EXPECTATIONS UPTILL NOW, I COULD ONLY WISH FOR ITS INCESSANCY"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"NAME: HARSH SINGH
      
      PHONE EXPERTISE: MODERATELY HIGH
      
      INTEREST IN GADGETS: TOO MUCH
      
      
      I HAVEN'T BOUGHT THIS DEVICE BUT MY FRIEND HAS AND I USE IT ON A DAILY BASIS. IT IS A VERY GOOD PHONE AT THIS PRICE AND IS FROM MICROMAX WHICH IS THE ONLY INDIAN COMPANY ON WHICH YOU ARE FREE TO EXPECT QUALITY. BUT MICROMAX IS ALSO THE COMPANY FROM WHICH YOU CAN'T EXPECT ANYTHING EXTRAORDINARY AND THAT'S WHERE THIS DEVICE FALLS BACK.
      
      
      BUILD QUALITY (8/10):
      
      THIS DEVICE HAS EXCELLENT BUILD QUALITY. IT IS THIN AND LIGHT. IT FEELS PREMIUM IN HANDS EVEN THOUGH IT IS MADE OF PLASTIC. ONE THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS DEVICE IS THAT THE CAMERA IS POTRUDING FROM THE BACK DUE TO WHICH WHEN YOU KEEP THE PHONE ON ITS BACK LIKE USUAL, YOU WILL FIND THE PHONE RESTING ON THE CAMERA WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS FEASIBLE, AS THE SURFACE ON WHICH IT IS KEPT, MIGHT BE ROUGH.
      
      
      HARDWARE (10/10):
      
      THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE IT BLOWS MOST OF THE PHONES OUT OF COMPETITION. EXCEPT ONE OR TWO PHONES OUT THERE, THIS BEAST HAS THE BEST HARDWARE YOU CAN GET AT THIS PRICE. A QUAD-CORE CORTEX A9 COUPLED WITH MALI 400 AND 1 GB OF MEMORY MAKES IT A POWERFUL DEVICE WHICH IS CAPABLE OF PLAYING ALL MODERN GAMES SMOOTHLY AND EASILY.
      
      
      SCREEN (10/10):
      
      IT HAS A 720P HD SCREEN WHICH IS AGAIN GREAT CONSIDERING THE PRICE. SO, YOU CAN EXPECT GREAT CLARITY ON THE DEVICE AND NO PIXELIZATION. IT ALSO HAS AN AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR WHICH ASSISTS IN KEEPING THE BRIGHTNESS TO THE BARE ESSENTIALS WHEN REQUIRED AND PUMPING IT UP TO THE HIGHEST NIT, SO THAT IT IS EASILY USABLE UNDER DIRECT SUNLIGHT.
      
      
      OS (7/10):
      
      IT RUNS ON ANDROID 4.1.2 JELLY BEAN, WHICH IS NOT THE LATEST VERSION OF JELLY BEAN ON THIS DEVICE. KEEPING IN MIND THE SERVICES OF MICROMAX, I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE AN OFFICIAL JELLY BEAN 4.2.2 OR HIGHER JELLY BEAN UPDATE AS MICROMAX IS ALREADY LAUNCHING NEW DEVICES IN THIS SEGMENT. ALSO, THIS IS AN INDIA-EXCLUSIVE PHONE, WHICH MEANS THERE IS VERY LITTLE DEVELOPERS UPPORT. THAT MEANS, YOU CAN PROBABLY GET A 4.2.2 UPDATE FROM SEARCHING AT GOOGLE, BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH SCOPE OF DEVELOPMENT ON THIS DEVICE AS THE AVAILABLE DEVELOPERS ARE ONLY FROM INDIA.
      
      
      INTERFACE (6/10):
      
      IT'S INTERFACE IS, PUTTING IT DELICATELY, STUPID. IT IS AS CLOSE TO STOCK ANDROID AS POSSIBLE WHICH SHOULD BE A GOOD THING, BUT SOMEHOW MICROMAX HAS MANAGED TO MAKE IT LOOK UGLY. IT HAS NO PROMINENT FEATURES LIKE PHONES FROM SAMSUNG AND SONY, KEEPING IT LIGHTWEIGHT AND JUST AS FUNCTIONAL AS STOCK ANDROID. I WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY WITH THE NEXUS EXPERIENCE, BUT THE TRUTH IS THERE IS NO NEXUS EXPERIENCE. WHEN PULLING DOWN THE NOTIFICATION PANEL, ONE WILL NOTICE THAT IT HAS THE UGLIEST NOTIFICATION CENTER OUT THERE. ALSO, IT HAS ADDED FEW USELESS APPS WHICH ARE OF NO USE, JUST LIKE SAMSUNG HAS DONE WITH ITS PHONES.
      
      
      CAMERA (CAN'T SAY):
      
      I DON'T HAVE A GOOD KNOWLEDGE ON CAMERAS BUT I KNOW ONE THING FOR SURE, THAT THE 8-MP CAMERA ON THIS DEVICE SEEMS PRETTY NICE. IT IS OBVIOUSLY GOOD ENOUGH FOR DAILY USAGE.
      
      
      BATTERY (10/10):
      
      IT LASTS A WHOLE DAY ON AVERAGE USAGE INCLUDING GAMING, BROWSING, CALLING AND MULTITASKING. THIS IS GREAT POINT OF ATTRACTION FOR THIS DEVICE AS IT PROVIDES POWERERFUL HARDWARE ALONG WITH GREAT BATTERY LIFE.
      
      
      CONCLUSION:
      
      IF YOU ARE A GENERAL USER WHO PLAYS GAMES AND WANTS PRODUCTIVITY OUT OF THEIR DEVICE, IT IS A GREAT PHONE. IT IS GREAT FOR CORPORATE OR OFFICE GOING PEOPLE. BUT, IT IS NOT GREAT ENOUGH FOR ENTHUSIASTS (LIKE ME) WHO LIKE CUSTOMIZING AND WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR THEIR PHONE THROUGH DEVELOPERS. ALSO IT HAS NOT-UP-TO-THE-MARK SOUND QUALITY AND THOSE WHO DEMAND QUALITY, IT IS AGAIN NOT A PHONE FOR THEM. FOR THEM XPERIA M IS THE BEST OPTION OUT THERE.
      
      BUT, IF YOU ARE WILLING TO BUY THIS PHONE XOLO PLAY IS ALSO NOT A BAD OPTION."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,4,"OVERALL A GOOD PRODUCT AT THAT PRICE!

      CONS:
      
      1. NOT SMART: LIKE SAMSUNG'S SMART EYE
      
      2. NO DLNA/NFC
      
      3. NO SNS INTEGRATION
      
      4. PRETTY BAD EXTERNAL SPEAKERS/AUTO BRIGHTNESS FLICKERS/SLOW GPS LOCKS
      
      
      DECISION: RECOMMENDED PURELY FOR A VERY AFFORDABLE YET FAST PERFORMING SMARTPHONE. BUT YES, MICROMAX MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A GREAT PHONE WHICH ENDS UP ""GOOD"""
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"@ RAJ DEEP, THANKS MAN. I HAVE DECIDED TO GO WITH THAT 13MP. I HAVE ALSO READ THE SAME AT MOBILESWHISPER.BLOGSPOT.IN. REALLY IT IS TOTALLY DOUBLE THE VALUE OF CANVAS HD. PRICE IS ALSO COOL. FEATURES ARE SO TEMPTING. I DONT MIND GOING WITH IT. AFTER ALL CA"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,A116 SCREEN IS NOW OLD NEWS. IT WAS GREAT BUY FEW MONTHS BACK BUT WITH LAUCH OF FHD PHONES.1920*1080 RESOLUTION. AND WITH COMPETITOR WICKEDLEAK LAUNCHING WAMMY PASSION Z. AT 15K. IT WILL TOUCH FOR MICROMAX IN THE MARKET NOW. THERE ARE BETTER BUYS FOR SURE. MICROMAX SHOULD REDUCE THE PRICE
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"ALL THE USERS HERE SAYING THAT MICROMAX PHONES ARE DEFECTED. BUT ALL THE REAL GUYS WHICH I ASKED THAT HOW'Z THERE EXPERIENCE WITH MMX CANVAS PHONES AND OTHER MMX CHEAP PHONES, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM. NOT EVEN IN OTHER COMPANIES LIKE SAMSUNG, NOKIA AND KARBONN. AS FAR AS I HEARD ABOUT THESE PHONES.
      
      MORE THAN HALF OF THE REVIEWS SAYS THAT MMX IS NOT GOOD COMPANY. BUT I HAVE READ LOTS OF GOOD COMMENTS AND REVIEWS IN OTHER WEBSITES TOO IN GROUPS IN FACEBOOK. AND ALL DENY THAT THEY HAD ANY BAD EXPERIENCE. GOOD CAMERA , GOOD GPS AND EVERYTHING SMOOTH IN THEIR PHONE.
      
      
      EVEN WHICH MOBILE I AM HAVING (SAMSUNG GALAXY) HAS NOT GIVEN ANY BAD EXPERIENCE. AND I HAVE READ BAD EXPERIENCE REVIEWS ABOUT THEM. WHICH I DON'T THINK THEY ARE REAL.
      
      
      SO GUYS PLEASE DON'T JUDGE THE PHONE ONLY ON THE BASIS OF GAMING ONLY.
      
      AND DON'T EXPERIENCE THE 20 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA QUALITY FROM THE CAMERA OF 3 MEGAPIXELS.
      
      
      AND REALLY FLIPKART IS VERY TRUSTABLE WEBSITE AND VERY QUICKLY DELIVER THE STUFF WITHIN SOME DAYS."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE I WAS AWARE THAT THIS PHONE IS HAVING BAD CMERA EVEN THOUGH MICROMAX SAYS THAT 8MP REAR CAMERA ITS PICTURE QUALITY IS BELOW 3MP CAMERA OF HTC/SONY.AND IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL BIG GAMES LIKE NFS IT IS BIT DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF LOW LIMITED INTERNAL MEMORY.BUT I LIKED THE SCREEN QUALITY AND LOOK. COMPARED TO MOBILES IN THE RANGE 13K I THINK THIS SCORES HIGH.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"BOUGHT MICROMAX CANVAS HD A WEEK AGO AND IT SEEMS IT HAS SOME ISSUES AND PROBLEMS ACCORDING TO MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      MAJOR ISSUES:-
      
      
      1&GT; ITS TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS A MAJOR DRAWBACK. WHILE SCROLLING OR SLIDING OVER SCREEN IT ACCIDENTLY OPENS UP APPS OR DRAGS.
      
      
      2&GT; ITS AUTO ROTATE IS NOT SO RESPONSIVE. WHILE USING AUTO ROTATE IT DOES NOT ROTATE SCREEN IMMEDIATLY AND IT IS REQUIRED TO SHAKE PHONE VERTICALLY AND THEN HORIZONTAL  TO ROTATE THE SCREEN.(WHILE SWITCHING BETWEEN APPS)
      
      
      3&GT; IT HAS NO TASK MANAGER INSTALLED BY DEFAULT.SHOULD BE DOWNLOADED ONE FROM PLAY STORE WHICHEVER ONE YOU LIKE.
      
      
      4&GT; ACCELEROMETER IS NOT EVEN SO SMOOTH. WHILE PLAYING GAME LIKE TEMPLE RUN 2 IT SEEMS THAT I HAVE TO ALSO TILT MYSELF COMPLETELY WITH THE PHONE TO MOVE THE CHARACTER.
      
      
      5&GT;NO UPDATE OPTIONS AVAILABE FOR JELLYBEANS 4.2.(NOW). MAY BE AVAILEBLE IN NEAR FUTURE.
      
      
      6&GT;PHONE UI HANGS WHEN A MESSAGE IS RECIEVED.(FOR 2-3 SECS)
      
      
      7&GT; SOUNDS CUTS OR NOT AUDIBLE ON EITHER SIDES WHEN ON CALL.
      
      ...... AND MIGHT BE MORE TO FIND OUT......
      
      
      MINOR ISSUES:-
      
      
      1&GT; OTHER COMPANY EARPHONES ARE NOT SUPPORTED WITH DEVICE.... TRIED- SAMSUNGS,NOKIA,AND OTHER TYPES OF EARPHONES.
      
      
      2&GT;CAMERA IS NOT LIKE 8MP IN REAR AND 2MP IN FRONT... IT IS JUST OK.
      
      
      3&GT;AUDIO IS OK...NOT SO GOOD.
      
      
      4&GT; REVERSE THREATNING OR INTERNET PASSTHROUGH OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE LIKE HTC PHONES(SAMSUNG AND OTHER PHONSE ALSO DONT HAVE IT.... SO CAN IGNORE IT)
      
      
      5&GT; NOT SO MUCH ROMS,FIRMWARE,TWEKS,FAN-CLUBS,SUPPORT PAGES AVAILABLE DUE TO AN UPCOMING AND NOT REKNOWN WORLDWIDE.....
      
      
      OTHERWISE ITS A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THESE PHONE:-
      
      
      WHAT I LIKE:-
      
      1&GT;CLEAR AND HIGH RESOLUTION SCREEN.ITS 5 INCH BIG SCREEN.
      
      
      2&GT;VIEWING ANGLE ARE PLUS POINTS.
      
      
      3&GT;HARDWARE CONFIG IS THE BEST PART.
      
      
      4&GT;GPU IS VERY POWERFUL.
      
      
      5&GT;GREAT GAMING EXPERIENCE.SUPPORTS AND CAPABLE TO RUN ALL HD GAMES.(SOME GAMES REQUIRE MORE INTERNAL STORAGE TO RUN BUT IT HAS 2GB AVAILABLE..... CAN BE FIXED IF U PREFER TO ROOT UR PHONE)
      
      
      6&GT;CAN PLAY ALL HD VIDEOS.CAN PLAY ALL VIDEO/AUDIO FORMATS WITHOUT LAGS-MKV,FLV,VOB ETC.(REQUIRES AN VIDEO PLAYER OTHER THAN DEFAULT I USE BS PLAYER )WATCHING VIDEOS ON THIS PHONE IS ALSO A GOOD EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      7&GT;CPU IS ALSO A GREAT ADVANTAGE(QUAD CORE CLOCKED AT 1.2 GHZ).ITS REALLLLLY FAST.I CAN INSTALL A APP ABOUT 90 MB IN JUST 5-6 SECONDS.
      
      
      8&GT;DUAL SIM FUNCTIONALITY IS ALSO COOL. SWITCHING BETWEEN SIMS FOR DIFF WORKS IS EASY AND CATCHY(SMS,MMS,INTERNET,CALLS ETC).
      
      
      I AM GOING TO LOVE THIS PHONE IF IT DOES NOT SHOW ME SOME NEW ISSUES AN I GOT FIXES FOR PREVIOUS ISSUES. :)
      
      
      PLEASE SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH ME AND ALSO SUGGEST POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS WITH ME......
      
      
      GOOD LUCK.
      
      
      IT'S A GREAT PHONE OTHERWISE IN SUCH HANDY PRICE,IF THESE ISSUES ARE FIXED. SPECIALLY TOUCH, AUTOROTATE AND UI HANG ISSUE!!!"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"CHEAP PLASTIC USED FOR CASING WHICH IS A HUGE TURNOFF. SOMETIMES GETS PROBLEM WITH NETWORK WHILE TRAVELLING - IT MAY SHOW SIGNAL ON THE SCREEN BUT ACTUALLY IT WONT BE RECEIVING ANY AND IF ANYONE CALLS U THAT TIME, THEY GET PHONE SWITCHED OFF / NOT REACHABLE MESSAGE.

Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,GOOD PRODUCT - WORTH THE MONEY SPENT. MMX NEED TO LOOK AT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE BATTERY CHARGE THOUGH.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,GREAT PHONE ........ INITIALLY HAD SOME TECH ISSUE WITH PHONE ....... HOWEVER IT WAS RESOLVED AND HANDSET WAS REPLACED WITH A BRAND NEW ONE ... GREAT CUST SERVICE .... VERY HAPPY AND APPRECIATE FLIPKART
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"HAD BOUGHT THIS RECENTLY THOUGH WASN'T LUCKY ON FIRST ATTEMPT AND GOT AN DEFECTIVE PIECE. UPON MY REQUEST , THEY REPLACED IT AND THE NEW ONE IS WORKING PERFECTLY SO FAR. THANKS."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"HEY GUYS, ILL KEEP IT SHORT.. ONE OF MY RELATIVES PURCHASED MMX CANVAS HD APRIL 1ST WEEK FROM FLIPKART...NO ISSUES WITH FLIPKART BUT PRODUCT HAD TOO MANY GLITCHES AS ALREADY SPOTTED IN SO MANY YOUTUBE N FLIPKART USER REVIEWS.. AFTER 16DAYS OF USING IT ""NORMALLY"" (ON NORMAL USAGE- NO PLAYING GAMES OR EVEN 3G BROWSING), THE PHONE UI GOT STUCK A LOT OF TIMES, BATTERY GOT DRAINED OFF PRETTY QUICKLY (4-5 HRS) AND SHE COMPLAINED OF A DEVASTATED CAM QUALITY..IT GAVE THE QUALITY OF HER 5233 NOKIA EXPRESS MUSIC CAM 2MP FRONT CAM WAS VGA QLTY... THEN THERE WAS A CREEKING NOISE AT THE BACK AND SHE COULD NOT FIX THE HARDWARE TRIED MANY TIMES.. AND NORMALLY SHEZ AN ANDROID LOVER, SO SHE INSTALLED TOO MANY APPS N HER ROM GOT JAMMED AND PHONE CRASHED UNTIL RESTART 6 TIMES A DAY FOR A WEEK TILL SHE THOUGHT OF GIVING TO CUST SUPPORT... VERY VERY SADLY ENOUGH, SHE TRIED MORE THAN ENOUGH TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ALL THE OFFICES OF MICROMAX IN HER STATE AND ALSO CALLED UP THE NOS GIVEN IN MICROMAXINFO WEBSITE AND ALSO THE DELIVERER IN FLIPKART; BT FLIPKART DIN HAVE THEIR SUPERDEALER NO AND NONE FROM MICROMAX RESPONDED EVER..FORGET ABOUT SUBMITTING THE HANDST FOR RECOVERY...
      
      I WOULD GIVE THE PHONE AN 'OVERALL' RATING OF 2.8/5 OR 2.5/5 BASED ON ITS PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY AND AFTER-SALES PARAMETERS... ITS YOUR PERSONAL CHOICE GUYS, BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THE XOLO Q800 WHICH IS SELLING LIKE WILDFIRE...AVAILABLE IN EVERY ONLINE MALLS(STORES).. FOR A CHANGE, SEE THE NO OF REVIEWS N RATINGS OF THIS PARTICULAR MODEL IN FLIPKART N READ THE REVIEWS IN YOUTUBE..YOU WOULD BE AMAZED WHAT QUALITY XOLO PROVIDES US WITH WHAT KIND OF SPECS AND WHAT MICROMAX GIVES US...XOLO HS ITS OWN CUSTOMER SUPPORT CENTERS ACROSS SUBURBAN LOCATIONS AS I CALLED THEM RECENTLY, AND THEY WERE FRIENDLY ENOUGH TO ENTERTAIN ME ON MY QUERIES QUITE WELL..
      
      SEE THE ""IN-DEPTH REVIEWS"" AND SPECIALLY THE ""CAM"" QUALITIES OF XOLO ""Q800"" IN YOUTUBE..(THERE ARE 2-3 VIDEOS OF THE SAME) N COMPARE IT WITH CANVASHD (THEY ARE RIVALS) N PLEASE THEN MAKE THE PURCHASING DECISION...ALSO THEY SAY IT'S GOT A HANDSOME ""16 HOURS"" OF CONTINUOUS TALKTIME IN 2G WHICH IS MINDBLOWING FOR SUCH A PRODUCT.. I HAVE ALREADY ORDERED THE SAME PRDUCT FROM SNAPDEAL AS THAT TIME THE MRP FROM FLIPKART WAS A GRAND MORE THAN THE ""OFFER"" PRICE THEY ARE GIVING US NOW..SO I ORDERED FROM SNAPDEAL..SCHEDULED TO COME TO ME BY A DAY OR TWO...
      
      Q800 HAS GOOD BUILD UP (SLEEK IPHONE DESIGN), ROBUST BATTERY LIFE, 8 MP CAM WITH CMOS AND BSI SENSORS (WHICH GIVES 10MP QUALITY IN ACTUAL) N FRONT 1MP QUALITY (GIVES 1.3MP QUALITY) N THE BEST THING WHICH I FOUND OUT FROM MANY REVIEWS AT YOUTUBE IS THAT THE INTERNAL MEMORY OF Q800 (WHERE YOUR MAIN APPS AND GAMES GET INSTALLED) CAN BE ""SWAPPED"" TO YOUR EXTERNAL 32GB SD, WHICH MEANS PRACTICALLY YOU CAN AVAIL THE ENTIRE 32GB SPACE FOR INSTALLATION..THATS THERE IN TOO FEW SMARTPHONES AT THE MARKET. ALSO DO NOT FORGET THE BENCHMARKS SCORES... XOLO Q800 BEATS CANVASHD ""HANDS DOWN"" IN EACH SCORE... FOR EX. IN NENAMARK2, Q800 SCORES 54FPS WHICH IS 40FPS IN MMXCANVASHD ..
      
      SO GUYS, THERE'S MY FEEDBACK ABOUT MICROMAX CANVS HD WHICH IS LEAST ADVISABLE TO BUY, INSTEAD, THIS EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR SUCH SPLENDID PRICE OFFERING FROM YOUR OWN INDIAN MANUFACTURER IS A REAL DELIGHT N GIVE IT A THOUGHT OR TWO ON THE DEAL..TC"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"HI..I HAVE A CANVAS 110 FOR 6 MONTHS NOW.  POST JELLY BEAN UPDATE IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY AND AM SUPER IMPRESSED WITH IT. EXCEPT PLAYING HD GAMES...I USE ALMOST EVERY FEATURE AND THEY ALL WORK WELL.  THIS WEEKEND I WANTED TO BUY A PHONE FOR MY WIFE  WHO WANTED A 'BRANDED' AND WAS TILTING TOWARDS THE GRAND SINCE MICROMAX SERVICE IS VERY SO-SO.  BUT I HAVE SEEN FEW EXAMPLES OF GRAND S3 OUTER WHITE COVER BECOME BROWN AFTER 1-2 MONTHS OF USE AND HENCE I WENT WITH MICROMAX HD.
      
      
      MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD AS I AM ALREADY A CANVAS CUSTOMER.  ITS SLIMMER THAN MY 110, SCREEN IS VERY GOOD AND IT IS SUPER FAST.  I GOT THE PHONE FOR 14,300 ON BVK IYENGAR ROAD IN BLORE AND THAT INCLUDED SCREEN GUARD AND INSIDE THE BOX I ALSO FOUND A BLACK FLIP COVER LIKE THE WHILE SAMSUNG FLIP COVER FOR GRAND AND S3.
      
      
      SO THE BAD RATING IS FOR FLIPKART SELLING IT FOR 15999 - THATS 1700 MORE!!!!  IF YOU ARE IN BLORE GO TO GVK IYENGAR ROAD AND BUY THIS PHONE FOR UNDER 14.5K!!"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"I BOUGHT MICROMAX CAVAS HD A116 FROM FLIPKART, GREAT SERVICE FROM FLIPKART, PHONE WAS DELIVERED WITHIN 24 HRS.
      
      ABOUT THE PHONE. INTERFACE IS GREAT, PROCESSOR IS GREAT APPS DON'T HANG, GAMING EXPERIENCE IS ALSO COOL.
      
      CAMERA IS OK, COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR 8 MEGAPIXEL (ACTUALLY IT IS AS GOOD AS A 5 MEGAPIXEL) NIGHT SHOOTING IS A DISASTER.
      
      PHONE CALL RECIEVING ABILITY IS QUITE POOR, SPEAKERS REALLY SUCK AND THE BATTERY LIFE IS MISERABLE.
      
      MY RECOMMENDATION: AT 14K NOT WORTH IT. GO FOR SAMSUNG GRAND INSTEAD."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 1 MONTHS BACK. I WENT FOR THIS PHONE AS I THOUGHT IT IS VALUE FOR MONEY. BUT FEW THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO GO FOR THIS PHONE.
      
      1. PERFORMANCE WISE THIS IS A STELLAR PHONE. THE TOUCHSCREEN IS FAST &AMP; RESPONSIVE WITH CRYSTAL CLEAR DISPLAY AND YOU CAN RUN ANY VIDEOS/APPS WITHOUT ANY LAG. EQUALS SAMSUNG S3 IN THAT FRONT.
      
      2. BATTERY IS DECENT. I HAVE TO CHARGE MY PHONE EVERY 36-48 HOURS BASED ON MODERATE USAGE OF 1 HOUR GAMING 2-3 HOURS WIFI &AMP; APPS AND 1 HOUR TALKTIME. IT GETS FULLY CHARGED WITHIN AN HOUR. BETTER THAN OTHER SMARTPHONES.
      
      3. NETWORK &AMP; CALL QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT LOUDSPEAKER MIKE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. STORAGE IS LOW AND DISAPPOINTED WITH IT. IF YOU DOWNLOAD 6-10 STANDARD APPS AND KEEP AROUND  500MB(~180) OF SONGS, VERY SOON YOU WILL START GETTING LOW STORAGE SPACE POP UPS. THEN YOU HAVE TO CLEAR CACHE OR MANUALLY DISABLE/UNINSTALL CERTAIN APPS. MOREOVER WITH EXTERNAL CARD ALSO THERE ARE ROOTING PROBLEMS FOR APPS. SO HEAVY GAMERS ARE ADVISED TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE. ADDITIONAL COST OF 800 RS FOR CARD!
      
      2. DON'T GO FOR WHITE COLOR PANEL. IT WILL BE DULL IN 3 DAYS! CAUSE OF ITS MATT FINISH IT ATTRACTS DIRT AND BECOMES PALE WHITE VERY SOON. FLIP PANEL QUALITY IS NOT PAR WITH SAMSUNG PHONES. DOESN'T FEEL ROBUST. ADDITIONAL COST OF PANEL CHANGE 300 RS!
      
      3. HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE TO SERVICE THIS PHONE SOON! BUT NOWADAYS ALL COMPANY SERVICE CENTERS TAKES TIME AND DELAYS ARE EXPECTED.
      
      
      THIS PHONE SUITS FOR MODERATE USAGE, COST SENSITIVE BUYERS WHO CAN HANDLE THEIR PHONE PROPERLY. THIS WEIGHED MY OPTIONS AND I CHANGE PHONES IN AN YEAR OR SO, SO I WENT FOR THIS MOBILE. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ROUGH USAGE. CHECK ZOLO FO SUPERIOR BUILD QUALITY."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 15TH APRIL 2013 (NOT IN FLIPKART). CANNOT BLAME ON ITS SPECS AND PERFORMANCE. IT IS AWESOME AND YOU ARE LUCKY TO GET THIS IN THIS LOWER PRICE. IF YOU GET THE DEFECT FREE PHONE THEN YOU ARE THE LUCKIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. YOU WILL GET A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE I ASSURE. BUT IF YOU GET ANY PRBLM THEN EVERYTHING IS OVER!!!
      
      
      HERE IS MY EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      MY PHONE GOT SOME PROBLEMS IN OUTPUT SPEAKER AFTER 5 DAYS ITSELF AND I SUBMITTED IT TO SERVICE CENTRE ON MAY 4TH 2013. THEY ASKED ME TO COME AFTER 15 DAYS. I THOUGHT 15 DAYS IS LONG TIME TO REPAIR A HANDSET BUT THERE IS NO OPTION FOR ME SO I ACCEPTED. BUT STILL IT IS IN SERVICE CENTRE AND WHEN I ASK ABOUT MY PHONE STATUS THEY ARE REPEATING THE SAME DIALOGUE AS AN ANSWERING MACHINE LIKE ""KINDLY WAIT FOR MORE 7 WORKING DAYS'. WHEN I CALL TO MICROMAX CARE ALSO THEY ARE REPEATING THE SAME AND THEY ARE NOT GIVING THE PROPER ANSWER. WHEN I EMAIL THEM (TILL NOW 9 MAILS), THEY ARE REPLYING ME WITH AUTO GENERATED MAIL.
      
      
      NOT ONLY A116 HAVING THESE KIND OF SERVICING ISSUES BUT ALL PRODUCTS FROM MICROMAX. IF YOU CANNOT SELL A DEFECT FREE PRODUCT THEN WHY ARE YOU INTO THE MARKET. YOU ARE HAVING THE NAME LIKE 10TH LARGEST MOBILE PRODUCER IN THE WORLD. BUT I WOULD SAY, YOU ARE THE WORST MOBILE SERVICE PROVIDER AFTER SALES. SURELY I WONT BUY ANY OF MICROMAX PRODUCT AFTER THIS BAD EXPERIENCE, AS WELL I WONT SUGGEST ANYONE TO BUY THIS CRAP BRAND.
      
      
      YOU ARE READY TO SPEND MUCH AMOUNT IN SERVICING THE HANDSET THEN GO FOR MICROMAX.
      
      
      GUYS, IF YOU HAVING THE PHONE IN GOOD CONDITION THEN YOU ARE THE LUCKIEST... CONGRATULATIONS...!"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"I FOUND ONE PROBLEM IN THIS PHONE IS
      
      WHILE CHARGING THE PHONE, SOME APPLICATIONS RUN AUTOMATICALLY AND TO STOP THAT APPLICATIONS I HAVE TO REMOVE THE CHARGING CABLE THEN ONLY I CAN STOP THEM
      
      AND CHARGING INTERRUPTS MY WORK ON PHONE IT SLOW DOWNS PROCESSES AND LOAD TO OPEN ALL FUNCTIONS

Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"I GO THIS PHONE 2 MONTHS BACK JULY 26TH 2013 TO BE EXACT. WORKED FANTASTIC, BATTERY LIFE WAS TOO GOOD MUCH BETTER THAN SAMSUNG GRAND WHICH I USED IT FOR FEW WEEKS BEFORE MISPLACING THE PHONE. I WAS USING MICROMAX A116 FOR EMAIL AND REGULAR CALLS
      
      
      THE MOTHER BOARD FAILED FOR NO GOOD REASON, I WAS OKAY AS IT IS AN ELECTRONIC GADGET. GAVE IT FOR SERVICE ON 6TH SEPTEMBER 2013 TO CELL TECH THE AUTHORIZED SERVICE PROVIDER OF MICROMAX IN CHENNAI. TODAY IS 19TH SEP 2013, NO ONE PICKS UP THE CALL IN THE NUMBER GIVEN, THE KIND OF COURTESY PROVIDED IN THE SERVICE CENTER MAKES YOU FEEL LOW, NO PROACTIVE UPDATES NEITHER RESPONSE.
      
      
      ON CONTRARY I HAVE SEEN SAMSUNG SERVICE, THEY GIVE A GOOD SERVICE WITHIN 2 DAYS THEY REPAIR THE PHONE. NET NET WATCH OUT FOR MICROMAX SERVICE, PHONE AS SUCH IS GOOD.
      
      
      FLIPKART DELIVERY IS FANTASTIC &AMP; OTHER EXP HAS BEEN GOOD, FLIPKART GIVES A VOW FACTOR IN DELIVERY EXPERIENCE."

I HAVE TO MANAGE WITH MY OTHER SMARTPHONE CHARGER."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS MOBILE FROM THE SELLER WS RETAIL  (DELIVERED FROM BANGALORE CENTER) AND REALIZED THAT THE BATTERY SLOT HAS GOT SEVERAL SCRATCHES AND THE STICKER WAS ALSO TAMPERED.

      01.PRODUCT FINISH IS POOR AS COMPARE TO SAMSUNG/HTC.

BODY OF PHONE CAN BE MADE BETTER, IT LOOKS VERY CHEAP QUALITY PLASTIC BODY SIMILAR TO CHINA MADE PHONE, SO BETTER TO GO WITH SOME DECENT FLIP COVER.
      
      ALSO, TILL DATE I HAD NOT RECEIVED THE CASHBACK, SO DON'T KNOW HOW GENUINE ARE THESE OFFERS WHICH FLIPKART MADE FOR CASHBACK. BCOZ OF CASHBACK ONLY I PURCHASED FROM FLIPKART ELSE I WAS GETTING SAME PHONE FROM ON DIFFERENT SITE AT SOMEWHAT 300 BUCKS LESSER."

      I DID GET IT REPLACED BUT THE TRUST ONCE GONE CANNOT COME BACK!!
      
      ON THE BRIGHT SIDE THERE WERE NO LAGS OR ANY GAMING PROBLEM IN THE TWO DAYS IT WAS WITH ME IT WON MY HEART BUT THE TOUCH PAD SCREWED IT UP!!"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"MICROMAX HAS LAUNCHED MANY DECENT PHONES NOW A DAYS BUT I BELIEVE CANVAS HD IS NOT ONE OF THEM. I HAVE SEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE PHONE AS IT IS UNABLE TO ACCEPT 2 SIM CARDS AT A TIME. IT ACCEPTS ONE SIM AND FOR ANOTHER SIM THERE ARE NO SIGNALS AT ALL. THEN WHAT IS THE USE OF PURCHASING A DUAL SIM PHONE?
      
      
      2ND ISSUE IS WITH THE BATTERY BACK UP. I BELIEVE AS IT HAS A 1080P DISPLAY  ITS CONSUMING BATTERY AS DRINKING WATER.
      
      
      CAMERA IS OK BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AS IT IS 8MP.
      
      
      SOME PROS REGARDING THE PHONE ARE GOOD IPS DISPLAY, 5 INCH TOUCH SCREEN, AND USER FRIENDLY ANDROID INTERFACE.
      
      
      I WOULD SUGGEST CANVAS 2 OR CANVAS 2 PLUS AS A BETTER OPTION TO PURCHASE...."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"MICROMAX HEAD PHONES ARE GETTING FUNCTION WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEK. THIS WAS HAPPEN TO MY MICROMAX HD HEADSET ALSO.
      
      ABOUT PHONE I WILL GIVE ONLY 3 STARS AS NEGATIVE POINTS ARE LIKE BELOW-
      
      RINGING VOLUME IS VERY LOW.
      
      GETTING STUCK SOME TIME.
      
      WE CAN'T ANY OTHER CHARGER (DIFFERENT DISPLAY WILL COME AND GO)
      
      CAN'T SHOOT THE VIDEOS IN ORIGINAL SIZE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"NO OFFENSE FLIPKART. YOU PRICED IT VERY HIGH. I GOT THIS MOBILE FROM LOCAL SHOP FOR 15K AND I FEEL 15K ALSO BIT HIGHER.
      
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT A WHITE COLOR ONE. PERSONALLY I DID NOT LIKE THE BACK PANEL OF THE WHITE MODEL BECAUSE ITS NOT GLOSSY LIKE THE BLACK MODEL AND FEEL BIT CHEAP.
      
      
      SECONS THINK I DO NOT LIKE IS THE COLOR REPRODUCTION OF THE PHONE. ITS HD, YES BUT I FEEL THE CONTRAST IS SET BIT HIGH AND SOME COLORS ARE WASHED OUT.
      
      
      THIRD AND LAST THINK I DO NOT LIKE WITH THE HANDSET IS THE LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY. THE LED LIGHT SEEMS TO BE NOT CAPABLE OF ANYTHING. CAMERA IS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE A110. I OWN BOTH THE SETS AND PERSONALLY FEEL MICROMAX SHOULD HAVE INCREASED THE LED LIGHT QUALITY OF THE PHONE CONSIDERING THEY PRICED IT BIT HIGH.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE OKAY WITH THE CONS THEN ITS REALLY A GOOD PHONE. MICROMAX BLOATWARES ARE TAKING SOME DECENT AMOUNT OF RAM. UNFORTUNATELY TILL NOW NOBODY HAS TRIED ROOTING THIS PHONE SO THAT ALL THE BLOATWARES CAN BE REMOVED."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"POOR BATTERY, AND LOW SCREEN RESOLUTION.
      
      HOWEVER THE PRICING IS COMPETETIVE.
      
      YOU CAN GO FOR SAMSUNG CORE INSTEAD OF THIS PHONE FOR RELIABILITY"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"PROS -
      
      1. AMAZINGLY NICE DISPLAY
      
      2. NICE PROCESSOR AND SNAPPY PERFORMANCE
      
      3. AESTHETIC DESIGN AND ERGONOMICS
      
      4. PLEASANT UI ( I PREFER IT OVER SAMSUNG'S CARTOONISH TOUCHWIZ BLOATWARE)
      
      5. N YES IT'S GPS WORKS FOR SURE. EVEN USED IT WITHOUT ENABLING A-GPS ENHANCEMENT.
      
      
      CONS -
      
      1. CAMERA IS DOWNRIGHT DISAPPOINTING
      
      2. SPEAKERS R TOO FEEBLE
      
      3. BATTERY DRAINS QUICK
      
      
      REMARK - WIFI HARDWARE IS BAD...DOESN'T CATCH SIGNALS AND CONNECT EASILY
      
      NO RESPONSE IF U ENTER WRONG PASS CODE TOO. (KEEP GUESSING WHAT WENT WRONG)
      
      I ORDERED A REPLACEMENT COZ IT'S WIFI SIMPLY REFUSES TO CONNECT.
      
      
      TO FLIPKART - YOUR SERVICE MAYBE GOOD IN METROS/TIER 1 CITIES, BUT NOT UP TO THE MARK FOR TIER 2/3 CITIES N TOWNS. KINDLY TAKE IMMEDIATE NOTICE AND IMPROVE YOUR LOGISTICS."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"PROS:
      
      1. 5' INCH PHONE IF ARE LOOKING FOR BIG SCREEN
      
      2. DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD
      
      3. 1 GB RAM
      
      4. CAME WITH PROPRIETARY FLIP COVER
      
      5. PERFORMANCE IS CRISP. NO LAGS SO FAR.
      
      6. TOUCH IS ALSO VERY SMOOTH
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. DISPLAY IS GOOD BUT NOT AMOLED. I TRIED XOLO Q800 IN CROMA AND SAME LEVEL AND PRICED LESS THEN MMX BUT XOLO HAS ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE.
      
      2. THE BACK COVER IS MAT FINISH OF VERY POOR QUALITY. MINE IS WHITE AND IT HAS ALREADY TURNED PALE WHITE AFTER 15 DAYS OF CAREFUL USE. THE BORDERS OF THE COVER HAS TURN RED COLOUR.
      
      3. BATTERY IS NOT LONG LASTING WITH LIMITED USE. BATTERY DRAINS QUICKLY IF YOU GOT WIFI OR 3G ENABLED.
      
      4. NO GORILLA GLASS
      
      5. ONLY 4 GB INTERNAL SPACE. OUT OF WHICH YOU GET ONLY 1.77 GB. SO BETTER GET IT ROOTED FOR OPTIMUM USE.
      
      6. BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD, NOT GREAT, BUT GOOD
      
      7. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUTSOURCED TO THIRD PARTY MOBILE RESELLERS. HENCE, NOT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE OF MMX EITHER.
      
      8. SOUND QUALITY SUCKS TOO. YOU WILL NEED A REALLY GOOD QUALITY HEADPHONES TO COMPENSATE THE LOSS. I GOT SAMSUNG CHAT @335 WHICH PRODUCES BETTER SOUND QUALITY.
      
      9. PHONE SPEAKERS ARE ALSO NOT GOOD.
      
      10. VOLUME FROM EAR PIECE IS LOW. CALL QUALITY IS BETTER AND LOUDER WITH HEADPHONES.
      
      FOR THE PRICE QUOTED HERE IN FLIPKART OR ANY OTHER SITE IT IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE. IF YOU ASK ME ITS NOT WORTH MORE THAN 12000.
      
      
      FLIPKART WAS AS USUAL TOP NOTCH WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR SERVICE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"PROS:
      
      IT SET THE BENCHMARK WITH THE PRICE TAG OF 14K.
      
      IMPROVED DISPLAY QUALITY
      
      
      CONS:
      
      FLIPKART SHOULD HAVE FIX THE PRICE BELOW 15K....
      
      RAM SIZE IS STILL LOW @1GB.
      
      WHAT EVER THEY HAVE MENTIONED CAMERA QUALITY ON SPEC WE MIGHT NOT GET IN ACTUAL."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"THE BUILF QUALITY OF THIS PHONE IS PRETTY DEDENT.COMPANY HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL PROVIDE UPDATES FOR ITS UPCOMING MOBILES.
      
      I FIND THAT MICRO MAX SERVICE IS BAD BUT I AM SURE IT WILL IMPROVE.THE CAMERA IS NOT WHAT WAS EXPECTED BUT IS MANAGEABLE.DISPLAY IS GOOD , PROCESSORT IS FAST, LOTS OF GAMES INVOLVED...SO ALL IN ALL DECENT PHONE"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"THE GOOD:-GAMING,BROWSING,WATCHING MOVIES,TOUCH,CALL QUALITY AND KEYBOARD
      
      
      THE BAD:-CAMERA,DISPLAY(OK OK), BATTERY,SPEAKER
      
      
      OVERALL:-IF U DON'T SPEND WANT TO ABOVE 15K ON A SMARTPHONE THIS BY FAR IS THE BEST BUY"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"THE MAJOR PLUS POINT ABOUT THIS HANDSET IS THAT IT HAD THE LATEST SOFTWARE UPDATE OF THE TIME.
      
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO SOMEONE MOVING FROM A NOKIA OR LG SMARTPHONE.  IF YOU OWNED A SAMSUNG OR HTC SMARTPHONE, THEN YOU MAY BE DISAPPOINTED SINCE THE UI OF THOSE PHONES ARE AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL ALTOGETHER."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,THE PHONE FEELS PLASTICY AND BODY IS ALSO NOT WELL BUILT BUT IT PACKS A GOOD QUADCORE PROCESSOR AND 1GB OF MEMORY WHICH IS AMPLE AND THE PHONE NEVER LAGS.THE SCREEN IS NOT THAT GREAT BUT RESOULTION IS FULL HD AND DECENT ENOUGH.THE CAMERA BOASTS 8MP BUT DOESNT PERFORM LIKE ONE THE QUALITY IS VERY POOR.THE SCREEN IS NOT PROTECTED BY GORILLA GLASS. REST ALL IS VERY GOOD PHONES PRICE IS GREAT AT 16K GO FOR IT IF U JUST WANT A BIG SCREEN AND LOTS OF HORSEPOWER.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"THE PHONE HAS REALLY GUD SPECIFICATIONS ACCORDING TO D PRICE BT I WISH ITS CAMERA QUALITY WAS BETTER...ND THE SPEAKERS...ND INTERNAL MEMORY!!!!
      
      IT LUKS REALLY GUD!!! BRIGHTNESS IS BETTER DAN CANVAS 2.."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,THE PHONE IS SUPERB AND WONDERFUL (AS YOU WILL KNOW FROM OTHER REVIEWS). THE PROBLEM ARISES WITH THE LONGEVITY. IF YOUR PHONE DOES ENCOUNTER A PROBLEM THEN IT MIGHT TAKE QUITE A LONG TIME TO GET THE ISSUE FIXED. THE SPEC SHEET IS AMAZING. ANOTHER THING YOU NEED TO THINK OF IS WHETHER THIS PHONE WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE WEAR AND TEAR IN THE LONG TERM. SO KEEP THESE IN MIND BEFORE YOU GO FOR IT. LUCKILY THE PIECE I USED CAME OUT PRETTY GOOD. BUT SOME MIGHT NOT BE LUCKY.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"THE PROSUCT BUILD QUALITY NOT SO MUCH WORTH, WITH IN TWO MONTHS NORMAL USE THE THE FRAME SLIGHTLY CRACK. DONT GO FOR MICROMAX  SERVICE ALSO VERY PATICIC."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"THIS PHONE IS MADE BY CHINESE COMAPANY 'BEIDOU CHI ' ,IN INDIA SET NAME WAS MICROMAX A116 HD , AND IN PAKISTAN ITS NAME WAS Q-MOBILE A16 HD .....SO BAWARE THIS SET IS TOTTALY MADE BY CHEAP PARTS LIKE ITS MOTHERBOARD ,RAM QUALITY IS POOR &AMP; PROCESSOR IS GOOD BUT LAG AFTER SOME TIME , BAD CAMERA QUALITY DUE POOR LENS , LED NOT GOOD AS MENTIONED ,BODY LOOK CHEAP ,DONT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS SET , I KNOW ITS INDIAN COMPANY &AMP; THERE LOW PRICE PHONES ARE GOOD BUY ,BUT 15 TO 20K IS TOO MUCH FOR THESE CHINESE SET..... EVEN SAMSUNG USE CHEAP HARDWARE
      
      SO  GO FOR NOKIA ,SONY OR APPLE FOR BEST QUALITY HARDWARE QUALITY (THESE COMPANIES ASSEMBLE PHONES IN CHINA BUT USING GOOD QUALITY HARDWARE) AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE OR WAIT FOR NOKIA LUMIA 720 ..............."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,THIS PHONE IS VERY POWERFUL YET SO STYLISH THAT WE JUST CAN'T TAKE OUR EYES OFF. IT'S MASCULINE SHARP EDGES MAKES IT LOOK STYLISH PRODUCT..!! GUYS THERE ALSO OFFERS GOING ON PANASONIC PRODUCTS..
Micromax Canvas HD A116,3,"WHY NEW GIONEE MOBILES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN FLIPKART? THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN LOCAL STORES ALL OVER THE INDIA. THE PHONES FROM GIONEE ARE REALLY GOOD QUALITY. EVERY MODEL HAS VERY STRONG HARDWARE I.E RANGES STARTS FROM MINIMUM 512MB RAM AND 4GB INTERNAL MEMORY WHICH ARE REALLY NEEDED FOR A SMARTPHONE, WHERE SOME MANUFACTURERS LIKE MICROMAX LACKS. I HAVE A MICROMAX A87 AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN CHEATED, ONLY 160MB RAM, PATHETIC FOR GENERAL USE ALSO. ALL THE MODELS OF GIONEE LIKE CTRL V1, V2, V3, GPAD G1 ARE OWSOME. DREAM D1 CAN EASILY BEAT MICROMAX CANVAS HD WITH ITS SUPER AMOLED HD 316PPI SCREEN, GORILLA GLASS2, 8MP HD CAMERA, CORTEX QUAD CORE CPU, 4GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND 5 SENSORS. ALL THE MODELS ARE BETTER FROM CAMERA PERFORMANCE FROM MICROMAX AND MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS.
      
      CTRL V3 PRICING RS. 8700, THE CAMERA OF THAT PHONE WAS 5MP AUTO FOCUS, THE PHOTOS SHOOT BY ME WERE FAR BETTER THAN SONY MIRO 5MP OF A FRIEND PRICING 13000/-
      
      PERFORMANCE WAS BUTTER SMOOTH. G1 ALSO A PHONE TO BEAT CANVAS 2.
      
      SO GIONNE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN FLIPKART.
      
      VIRDICT- GIONEE IS A CHINESE MANUFACTURER. SO I RESEARCHED ON IT. WHAT I FOUND WAS REALLY GOOD. THEY ARE AWARD WINNER OF ""BEST QUALITY MANUFACTURER OF CHINA"". THEY DESIGN THEIR PHONES THEMSELVES, THEY HAVE OWN R&AMP;D, AND THEY MANUFACTURE THEIR PHONE THEMSELVES. TRULY A PHONE MAKER, NOT ONLY A PROFIT MAKER TO BUY PHONES FORM CHINA AND SELL IN INDIA."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,2,BEEN USING THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE. THE CAMERA SUCKS BIG TIME. SCREEN KEEPS YOU LONGING FOR MORE. OVERALL AN OK PRODUCT.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,2,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE A MONTH BACK , ITS A GREAT BUY FOR THE SPECS IT OFFERS FOR THE LOW PRICING.
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY IS BAD  THOUGH. CHARGING PORT BECAME DYSFUNCTIONAL AFTER  3 WEEKS.
      
      HAD TO RUN TO A SERVICE CENTER( THEY ARE VERY FEW AND IN REMOTE LOCATIONS) ,HAVE TO WAIT 2 WEEKS AT LEAST ."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,2,"CHECK THE LUMIA 520 &AMP; 620 (WINDOWS 8) AND IT'S PRICE MORE THEN BOTH. IN QUALITY MICROMAX IS CHEAPER THEN NOKIA.
      
      
      IF YOU GOT PROBLEM WITH MICROMAX THEN YOU WILL DEFINITELY NOT GET IT SOLVED EASILY. I CAN'T CLAIM SAME WITH NOKIA TOO.
      
      
      BUT NOKIA PRODUCT IS LESS PROBLEMATIC. THIS DEVICE CAN BE FALL DOWN OR STOP LOOSING FUNCTIONALITY AND FEATURES IN UPCOMING MONTHS.
      
      
      SOME PEOPLE ARGUE SAME. BE CAREFUL BEFORE PURCHASE MICROMAX. I HAVE A MICROMAX PHONE WHO HAVE ACTIVATED SPEAKER AND FROM THAT TIME IT'S NOT WORKING :("
Micromax Canvas HD A116,2,"HI ALL
      
      
      I HAD ORDER THIS MOBILE ON SEPT 4TH FROM FLIPKART, I MUST SAY ITS SERVICE IS FANTASTIC. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT WITH IN 3 DAYS &AMP; THEY DELIVERED IT ON SUNDAY.
      
      
      ABOUT THE PHONE, THE MOST DIS HEARTENING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT
      
      * BATTERY DRAINS A LOT FASTER EVEN THOUGH ITS 2000MAH BATTERY.
      
      * HEAD PHONE IS OF LOW QUALITY (CHEAP QUALITY)
      
      *CAMERA QUALITY AT NIGHT IS NOT GOOD AT ALL.. AT DAY LIGHT IS PRETTY OK.
      
      
      I WOULD PREFER TO GO FOR THE OTHER BRANDED PHONE RATHER THAN THIS AT THIS PRICE RANGE..
      
      
      PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING IT.."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,2,"I AM AN EXPERT USER AND I HAVE USED THIS PHONE. LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, I WAS ALSO CONFUSED BETWEEN MICROMAX CANVAS HD AND SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND. I HAVE CANCELLED MY BOOKING AND PURCHASED THE GALAXY GRAND. THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY ONE SHOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE:
      
      
      1. CUSTOMER SERVICE:- MICROMAX IS AN EMERGING COMPANY AND HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM IN YOUR PHONE, THEN FORGET YOUR PHONE FOR 2-3 MONTHS BECAUSE THIS MUCH TIME THE COMPANY TAKES TO REPAIR YOUR PHONE. (THIS IS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS I HAVE FACED THIS PROBLEM FROM MICROMAX)
      
      
      2. BUILT QUALITY:- THE BUILT QUALITY OF THIS DEVICE IS VERY POOR. SCREEN AND BACK PANEL IS HIGHLY PRONE TO SCRATCHES. THE SCREEN QUALITY IS SO POOR THAT ONCE YOUR PHONE FALLS DOWN BY MISTAKE, THE SCREEN WILL CRACK. AND ALSO THE SPARE PARTS OF THIS DEVICE ARE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE.
      
      
      3.SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT MICROMAX:- MICROMAX IS NOT A CHINESE COMPANY, ITS AN INDIAN COMPANY. BUT THE COMPANY PURCHASES THE SPARE PARTS OF THE PHONE FROM CHINA. YOU MUST BE AWARE HOW THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT OF CHINA ARE. THE PHONES ARE MADE IN INDIA IN GURGAON BUT THE PARTS OF THE PHONE ARE PURCHASED FROM CHINA.
      
      
      4. BATTERY :- THE BATTERY OF THIS PHONE IS ONLY 2000 MAH. IT IS VERY LOW BECAUSE IT IS A QUADCORE PHONE AND 4 CORES OF THE PHONE DRAINS A LOT OF BATTERY. ALSO DUE TO HD DISPLAY, IT WILL BE VERY BRIGHT AND IT WILL DRAIN A LOT OF BATTERY. AS MICROMAX HAS MENTIONED THERE IS ONLY 5HRS OF TALKTIME AS IN GALAXY GRAND THERE IS 10HRS OF TALKTIME. 2000 MAH BATTERY IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR A QUADCORE HD PHONE. IT WILL NOT LAST EVEN HALF A DAY.
      
      
      5.PROCESSOR :- MICROMAX HAS USED MEDIATEK PROCESSOR IN THIS PHONE. MEDIATEK PROCESSORS ARE VERY CHEAP IN QUALITY AND PRICE AND ARE EASILY AVAILABLE IN CHINA MARKET. SOME USERS COMPLAINT THAT MEDIATEK CHIPS JUST BURNED IN THEIR PHONE.
      
      
      6.INTERNAL MEMORY :- EVEN IF INTERNAL MEMORY IS 4GB, ONLY 1.7 GB IS ACCESSIBLE AS THE REMAINING MEMORY IS USED BY THE SYSTEM APPS. AND IN JELLY BEAN, YOU CANNOT MOVE APPS AND GAMES TO MEMORY CARD. SO HOW MUCH THINGS YOU CAN STORE IN 1.7 GB ?
      
      SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND HAS 8 GB INTERNAL FROM WHICH 4.5 GB IS USER ACCESSIBLE WHICH IS ENOUGH.
      
      
      7. SOFTWARE UPDATES :- THERE IS NO OPTION OF SOFTWARE UPDATES IN THIS PHONE. SO YOU CANNOT UPDATE YOUR ANDROID TO LATEST VERSION. ALSO THE COMPANY HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE UPDATES TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH SERVICE CENTERS AS THERE ARE VERY LESS NUMBER OF SERVICE CENTERS. SO IT IS A MAJOR DRAWBACK OF THE PHONE.
      
      
      P.S.- THE PHONE HAS MANY RANDOM CRASHES GLITCHES AND BUGS. AND DUE TO LACK OF SOFTWARE UPDATES, YOU CANNOT REMOVE THEM. SO YOU WILL FACE MANY SOFTWARE PROBLEMS ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      8. CAMERA - THE CAMERA ON THIS PHONE MAY BE 8 MP BUT THE QUALITY IS VERY POOR. YOU WILL FIND YOUR PHOTOS VERY PIXELATED. THE IMAGE QUALITY AND CLARITY WILL BE POOR. AND ALSO THE FRONT CAMERA OF 2MP IS OF VGA QUALITY WHICH IS ALSO VERY POOR. WHERE THE CAMERA OF SAMSUNG GRAND IS VERY GOOD AND ALSO BETTER THAN S3.
      
      
      9. SOUND QUALITY :- THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE LOUDSPEAKER ANS WELL AS THE EARPHONES IS VERY POOR. SOUND OF THE LOUDSPEAKER IS VERY LOW THAT WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF THE HOME YOU CANNOT RECIEVE CALLS. AND ALSO FOR MUSIC LOVERS, THE 3.5 MM JACK IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE COMPANY EARPHONES AND NOT WITH ANY OTHER EARPHONES. SO YOU WILL REGRET LISTENING TO THE SOUND.
      
      
      10. NETWORKS :- THE PHONE HAS ONLY DUAL BAND 2G NETWORK (GSM - 900, 1800) AND SINGLE BAND 3G NETWORK (UMTS - 2100). HENCE, YOU CANNOT USE YOUR PHONE AT MANY PLACES WHERE THESE NETWORKS ARE NOT SUPPORTED. ALSO THE NETWORK COVERAGE AND CALL QUALITY WILL BE VERY POOR. YOU WILL LOST NETWORK AT DISTANT PLACES MANY TIMES. WHILE SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND HAS QUAD BAND 2G (GSM - 850, 900, 1800, 1900) AND TRI BAND 3G (UMTS - 850 / 1900 / 2100).
      
      
      11. OTHER PROBLEMS :- THE OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH THE USERS COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THAT THE GPS IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. IT SHOWS WRONG POSITIONS. ALSO THIS PHONE SUDDENLY AUTOMATICALLY RESTARTS ANY TIME OR WHILE PLAYING GAMES. IT ALSO CRASHES AND HANGS A LOT WHILE USING CERTAIN APPS.
      
      
      12. PRICE - ALTHOUGH THE PRICE WAS GOOD BUT NOW IT IS 16K. WHY SHOULD YOU SPEND 16K ON MICROMAX WHEN YOU CAN GET THE GALAXY GRAND FOR 19K (FROM A LOCAL STORE NOT FLIPKART). IF ONCE YOUR DEVICE GETS BRICKED THEN YOUR 16K WILL GO WASTE FOREVER. DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS CRAP AND GO GET A GOOD PHONE FROM A GOOD BRAND LIKE SAMSUNG WHICH IS THE WORLD LEADER IN SMARTPHONES OR ANY OTHER LIKE SONY, HTC, LG. I AM PERSONALLY USING GALAXY GRAND AND IT IS A VERY GOOD PHONE THAN CANVAS HD.
      
      PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS ONE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,2,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM THE AUGUST 1ST 2013. THE PHONE HAD ALL THE FEATURES AND WAS VERY 100% USEFUL FOR ME. THIS PHONE MADE CHECKING MAILS,FB, WHATSAPP, BROWSING EASIER.
      
      
      BUT
      
      
      THEN ON THE 1ST OF FEBRUARY (EXACTLY 6 MONTHS) THE PHONE STARTED TO REVEAL ITS TRUE SELF. THE TOUCH SCREEN BECAME UNRESPONSIVE AND IS AUTOMATICALLY REBOOTING.
      
      
      HAVE TO TAKE IT TO THE SERVICE CENTRE. GIVEN THE INFO ABOUT THE SERVICE CENTRES I HOPE TO GET IT FIXED SOON.
      
      
      HOPE THIS MAKES YOUR DECISION EASIRE WHILE MAKING YOUR CHOICE. MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT MICROMAX IS COMPROMISING ON QUALITY TO SELL THEM CHEAPER.
      
      
      A LESSON FOR ME AND I AM GOING TO BE STICKING TO MY APPLE AND SAMSUNG BRANDS NOW."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,2,I BOUGHT A116 HD CANVAS FOR MY WIFE AS GIFT  ON 25TH MAY 2013 AND MOBILE FOUND DEAD ON JUNE 4TH 2013. IMMEDIATELY I REPORTED WITH UNIVERCEL AND THE.Y DIRECTED TO SERVICE CENTER. AFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTER LONG WAITING PERIOD IT FOUND MOTHERBOARD PROBLEM AND THE MOTHER BOARD REPLACED AFTER ONE MONTH. CUSTOMER CARE IS VERRRRRY VERY POOR. DON'T BUY MICROMAX PRODUCT.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,2,"I BUY THIS PRODUCT IN AUG,2013. SERVICES OF THE FLIPKART IS GOOD BUT QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT AT PAR WITH THE PRICE THEY ARE CHARGING SPECIALLY QUALITY OF CAMERA. MICROMAX OFFER THIS PHONE WITH 8MP CAMERA BUT IT WORK LIKE VGA CAMERA.
      
      
      NOT WORTH TO BUY"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,2,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE 8 MONTHS BACK.AFTER 2 MONTHS IT GOT COMPLAINED(DISPLAY PROBLEM) AND GIVEN TO COCHIN SERVICE CENTER.

      BUT AFTER 5 MONTHS IT GOT AGAIN COMPLAINED(SAME DISPLAY PROBLEM). I HAVE NOT YET GOT THE ITEM BACK AFTER REPAIR.(30 DAYS ALREADY).
      
      INITIALLY WHEN I CALLED THEM, THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER 20 DAYS TO BE GET REPAIRED.
      
      WHEN I CALLED AFTER 20 DAYS THEY TOLD ME TO PLEASE WAIT FOR ANOTHER 20 DAYS.(OMG!!)
      
      I THINK YOU WONT BELIEVE IT.BUT ITS TRUE!!!!
      
      THEIR BEHAVIOR SEEM TO BE LIKE THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS AFTER PURCHASE.I CANT BELIEVE THIS.SUCH A POOR SERVICE FACILITY THEY HAVE.
      
      THINK 100 TIMES BEFORE BUY MICROMAX.(ONCE YOUR PHONE GET COMPLAINT THEN YOU WILL BE HAVING ONLY TIME TO CALL THEM:-()

      PHONE WORKED REALLY WELL ALL THESE TIME, THE CAMERA QUALITY IS JUST EXCELLENT..
      
      THE PROBLEM STARTED AFTER I UPGRADED THE MEMORY CARD FROM 8GB TO 32GB.. WORKED WELL FOR A MONTH WITH 32GB MICRO SD CARD.. THEN OUT OF THE BLUE PHONE STARTED 'UNMOUNTING' THE MEMORY CARD FOR NO REASON.!! FIST I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE VIRUS, I FORMATTED THE SD CARD, BUT PROBLEM DIDN'T GET FIXED.. AFTER MANY TRIES I GAVE TO TO MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER, THEY GAVE IT BACK THE NEXT DAY TELLING THE PROBLEM IS FIXED WHICH WASN'T.!! I GAVE IT BACK 2 DAYS LATER, ALL THEY DID WAS RESET THE PHONE TO FACTORY SETTINGS AND RETURN.. WHICH DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.!!
      
      
      NO THE PROBLEM IS NOT WITH THE MEMORY CARD, BECAUSE THE SAME MEMORY CARD WORKS WELL WITH OTHER DEVICES AND THE PHONE REJECTS EVERY MEMORY CARD I PUT IN.!! SERVICE IS REALLY BAD.!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANY MICROMAX PRODUCTS UNTILL THEY IMPROVE THEIR SERVICES..!!

      PLEASE BEWARE OF MICROMAX PHONES PARTICULARLY THE COSTLIER PHONES ,,, IT MAY BE OFFERING  GOOD PRODUCTS IN THE RANGE OF RS.1000 TO 3000. PLEASE SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY BY BUYING SOMETHING ELSE THAN A MICROMAX.. I BROUGHT A116 HD IT'S EARPIECE STARTED TRANSFERRING VIBRATED SOUND BY THE NEXT AND FINALLY STOPPED WORKING ONE MONTH LATER. THE SERVICE CENTRE WAS LIKE OPD OH ANY GOVT. HOSPITALS EVERYONE WHERE CRYING AND SCREAMING.
      
      THEY ASKED ME TO DROP MY PHONE FOR 15 DAYS FOR THE CHANGE OF EARPIECE, I REFUSED AND STARTED USING HEADPHONE. AFTER ONE MORE MONTH IT FINALLY STOPPED ANY COMMUNICATION WITH ALL AVAILABLE MODE AND FINALLY I SHIFTED TO MY OLD SAMSUNG PHONE WHICH WAS PUT A SIDE AFTER BUYING THIS ANYTHING LIKE NOTHING PHONE...!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY...."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"DON'T BUY MICROMAX PHONES. NO SERVICE WARRANTY. DON'T BUY MICROMAX PHONES. NO SERVICE WARRANTY. THE SERVICE CENTRE GUYS WILL NOT NOT REPAIR YOUR PHONE.

I WILL REQUEST YOU GUYS TO CHECK THEIR OFFICIAL FACEBOOK PAGE HOW THEY ARE PLAYING WITH THEIR "" VALUED CUSTOMER"". PLEASE VISIT THEIR ONCE BEFORE BUYING ANY MICROMAX MOBILE OR BE READY FOR HARASSMENT. YOU CAN EVEN CHECK THE FLIPKART REVIEWS ON MMX SERVICE CENTERS."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"DON'T DARE TO TRUST MICROMAX ANYMORE, I TRUSTED GOT RESULT WITH CHARGING PROBLEM.
      
      
      NOT ONLY UPTO THIS I  SUBMITTED MY MOB TO MICROMAX CARE FROM LAST 2 MONTHS. STILL DID NOT GET ANY REPLY.
      
      
      ANOTHER THING I OBSERVED IS RUSH AT MICROMAX CARE IS INCREASING RAPIDLY AS I HAD MANY ROUNDS.
      
      
      YOU MAY BE THE NEXT VICTIM !!!"

WHEN I TRIED TO CONTACT MICROMAX, NON OF THEIR CUSTOMER CARE NUMBERS WORK WHICH IS MENTIONED ON THEIR WEBSITE. AND FINALLY WHEN I GOT HOLD OF THEM, THEY GAVE ME BANGALORE'S CUSTOMER CENTER NUMBERS WHICH DON'T EXIST AT ALL. AFTER REPEATEDLY CALLING UP THE CUSTOMER CARE NUMBER I FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE SERVICE CENTER IN THE WHOLE OF BANGALORE (RICHMOND ROAD). FIRST OF ALL, THEIR ATTITUDE IS RIDICULOUS, AND THEY SAID THAT IT WILL TAKE A MONTH IF ITS ANY THE PHONE HAS ANY HARDWARE ISSUE, AND MORE THAN A WEEK FOR ANY SOFTWARE ISSUE... AND I WILL ALSO NOT GET ANY SPARE PHONE FOR THAT WHOLE MONTH UNTIL ITS READY. STILL IF I AM GOING FOR ANY 2ND MICROMAX MOBILE, I WOULD BE THE BIGGEST FOOL EVER!!"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,DOODLE 2 BEATS THIS PHONE AT EACH AND EVERY STAGE AND THIS PHONE IS LITTLE OVERPRICED THAN DOODLE 2. I PERSONALLY FEEL DOODLE 2 IS FAR BETTER THAN THIS. THIS IS ALSO A GOOD PHONE. BUT COMPARE BEFORE YOU BUY
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,FIRSTLY I DID NOT BUY IT FROM FLIPKART. I BOUGHT IT FOR 14K.IT DOESNT HAVE PANAROMA.AS PER AS CAMERA IT HAS 8 MP CAM BUT SAMSUNG'S 3.2 MP CAM HAS MORE CLARITY THAN IT.COMPASS DOESNOT WORK IN IT.IT HAS VERY LOW INTERNAL STORAGE 1.77 GB.WHEN MY CANVAS HD HAS EVEN A FREE SPACE OF 1 GB IT'S SHOWING THAT STORAGE INSUFFICIENT SO APPS R UNBALE TO DOWNLOAD.MOST OF THE FORMATS R NOT PLAYING IN IT.WHEN FILE SHARING IS COMPLETED WITH BLUETOOTH THE FILE IS NOT BEEN SUPPORTED.FOR NAME RAM 1 GB BUT I THINK IT EVEN DON'T HAVE A RAM OF 512 MB.AT LAST I WANTED TO TELL IS DONT BUY CANVAS HD AT ALL I THINK WITH13K THERE R MANY MOBILES HAVING BETTER FEATURES THAN THIS.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,GOT DISPLAY PROBLEM AFTER 10 MINS WHEN I POWER ON THIS PHONE..   BLANK DISPLAY WITH COLOR LININGS LIKE BARCODE. THEY SAID TO DO FACTORY RESTORE. I CANT IMAGINE THAT HOW  SOME ONE IS SO STUPID TO SAY ALL THESE THINGS. HOW CAN U USE ANY FEATURE OF PHONE WITHOUT DISPLAY???
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"GOT THE PRODUCT WITH A SMALL SCRATCH ON SCREEN WHICH SOON EXPANDED TO WHOLE SCREEN, THEN THE PHONE STOPPED RESPONDING , BUTTONS STOPPED WORKING, CAMERA NOT WORKING!

      NOW AFTER 2 MONTHS, THE 2ND ISSUE CAME UP AGAIN. THIS PHONE LOOKS GOOD AND FEELS LIKE VALUE FOR MONEY. BUT THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU HAVE TO GO TO SERVICE CENTER KILLS IT. NEVER A MICROMAX AGAIN."

Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,I PURCHASED THIS MOBILE SET ON 06.08.2013.

PEOPLE TO BE CAREFUL.
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"I PURCHASED YOUR PHONE MICROMAX CANVAS HD A116 FROM FLIPKART.COM ON THE 5TH OF AUGUST 2013.
      
      
      ON THE THE 45TH DAY OF THE PURCHASE, WHILE I WAS SETTING UP THE PHONE FOR CHARGING USING THE USB CABLE FROM MY LAPTOP ON MY WORK DESK, THE SCREEN STARTED FLICKERING. I DECIDED TO REBOOT MY PHONE AND THE DISPLAY WENT DARKER AND STARTED FLICKERING EVEN MORE. I TOOK THE PHONE TO THE MICROMAX MOBILE ZONE, DWARKA, DELHI THE SAME DAY. THE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT SCREEN NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND THAT THE PHONE HAS BEEN PHYSICALLY DAMAGED; HENCE THE REPAIR WOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED UNDER WARRANTY. THE PHONE HAD BEEN DELICATELY HANDLED AND HENCE I DECIDED TO PURSUIT IT FURTHER WITH HIGHER AUTHORITIES. AFTER A LOT OF MAIL EXCHANGES AND TRIPS TO THE SERVICE CENTER THE PHONE WAS FINALLY TAKEN-IN BY THE SERVICE CENTER TO BE REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY. THERE WAS NO DURATION OF SERVICE MENTIONED AND HENCE I HAD NO IDEA WHEN TO EXPECT MY PHONE BACK.
      
      
      AFTER A LOT OF ENQUIRIES, I WAS ASKED TO RECEIVE MY PHONE AFTER 2 WEEKS. THE 1ST STRIKING OBSERVATION WAS THAT THE PHONE HAD LOST ITS NEW TOUCH AND FEEL AND THERE WAS AN EVIDENT GAP BETWEEN THE NEW SCREEN AND THE FRAME OF THE PHONE. WHEN I CHECKED THE PHONE AT THE SERVICE COUNTER, I FOUND OUT THAT THE NEW SCREEN WAS DAMAGED AND DYSFUNCTIONAL, AND WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER SCREEN REPLACEMENT.
      
      
      I WAS QUITE DISHEARTENED AND REQUESTED MICROMAX TO EITHER REFUND ME THE MONEY OR AT THE LEAST REPLACE THE PHONE BUT THERE WERE NO FURTHER REPLIES OR CORRESPONDENCE FROM THEIR END. I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE TO PURSUIT THIS FURTHER WITH THE CONSUMER COURTS.
      
      
      FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I UNDERSTAND THAT, THOUGH MICROMAX IS AN UPCOMING INDIAN BRAND WHICH HOLDS A LOT OF PROMISE, IT MAJORLY LACKS QUALITY PRODUCTS (PHONES AND EVEN SPARE PARTS). THE COMPANY REALLY FALLS SHORT ON COUNTS OF CUSTOMER AND SERVICE SUPPORT. THOUGH THE PRODUCTS HAVE SOME OF THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY PROPOSITIONS, THE QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE SUPPORT SYSTEMS APPEAR TO BE COMPROMISED."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"I RECEIVED THIS PHONE IN 20 HOURS AFTER PLACING THE ORDER. SUPER FAST AND AMAZING DELIVERY SPEED. I SET UP THE PHONE AND OPENED CAMERA. IT STARTED ADDING COLORS TO PICTURES AND VIDEOS ON ITS OWN. I HAVE BEEN USING ANDROID FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND BEING A TECH GUY I UNDERSTAND THINGS UP TO A GREAT EXTENT. I CHANGED ALL CAMERA SETTINGS BUT NOTHING WORKED. I WAS NOT SURPRISED AS I RED THE REVIEWS ON CAMERA OF THIS PHONE. I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I CONNECTED THE CHARGER TO THE PHONE. GUESS WHAT ? IT STARTED LAUNCHING APPLICATIONS ON ITS OWN VERY RANDOMLY. I KNEW THAT THERE ARE FEW BUGS IN THIS VERSION OF ANDRO AND IT WILL GET RESOLVED ONCE IT IS UPDATED TO JB 4.2. I WENT TO SERVICE CENTER NEAR MY LOCATION (ADDRESS WAS GIVEN BY FLIPKART WITH INVOICE COPY) AND FOUND THAT IT WAS CLOSED TWO YEARS AGO. SERVICE CENTER (IN RAJAJI NAGAR, BANGALORE IN CASE IF YOU KNOW) WHICH IS MENTIONED ON MICROMAX WEBSITE IS NOT OFFERING SERVICES TO MICROMAX ANYMORE. I WAS FRUSTRATED AND ASKED FOR A REFUND FROM FLIPKART. THEY SAID THEY WILL PROVIDE ME A REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT AND IF SECOND IS ALSO GIVING THE SAME ISSUE THEN THEY WILL RETURN MY MONEY. I GOT THE SECOND PHONE AND IT WAS DEFECTIVE TOO. WELL, I WILL NEVER BLAME FLIPKART AS THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY DURING THIS ENTIRE DRAMA AND THEY RETURNED MY MONEY BACK.
      
      TO CONFIRM THIS I ASKED ONE OF MY FRIEND IF HE IS FACING SAME ISSUE ON HIS SAME PHONE. HE SAID YES BUT HE IS SIMPLY IGNORING THOSE PROBLEMS AND USING IT.
      
      BEWARE OF MICROMAX MY FRIENDS."

I HAVE NEITHER RECEIVED THE REPLACEMENT NOR ANY UPDATES ON THIS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW FLIPKART FUNCTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO REPLACING ITEMS. ALL THE GOODWILL THAT FLIPKART HAS EARNED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS BEING MARRED NOW BECAUSE OF THIS UNBELIEVABLY SLOW RESPONSE AND ""I-DON'T-CARE"" ATTITUDE BY SOME SENIOR PEOPLE AT FLIPKART. SAD TO SEE THIS ENTERPRISE WHICH WAS SO PROFESSIONALLY MANAGED AND WAS PEOPLE'S FAVOURITE SHOPPING PORTAL NOT SO LONG AGO IS NOW NOT A PREFERRED PLACE WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO BUY STUFF, ESPECIALLY ELECTRONIC ITEMS. REALLY, IT'S A SHAME FOR FLIPKART!

Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"MICROMAX CANVAS 3:
      
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
      
      DEAR MMX DEVELOPERS DON'T DEVELOP SUCH HELL PRODUCTS. IT IS A PAIN FOR USERS PLEASE HAVE SOME QT ALSO IN YOUR TEAM. DON'T JUST JUST DEVELOP AND SELL IT. AND YES PLEASE PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES.
      
      DEAR USERS PLEASE DON'T GO FOR MMX PHONES OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE CURSING YOURSELF LIKE ME."

IN NO TIME THE CONDITION IS THAT IT CANNOT BE USED EVEN FOR TWO MINUTES, AND THE BATTERY DRAINS OUT.IT IS A USELESS PIECE OF JUNK NOW....SASTA ROYE BAAR BAAR, MEHNGA ROYE EK BAAR...NOT RECOMMENDED BY ME."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"NEVER EVER GO FOR THIS PHONE...I BEG YOU...I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO FACE THE PROBLEMS I AM FACING...
      
      FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST FLIPKART...IT IS AN AWESOME WEBSITE WITH LEAST RATES AMONG THE ONLINE WEBSITES...BUT HERE ARE MY GRIEVANCES AGAINST MICROMAX:-
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART ON 3RD JULY'13.....I RECEIVED MY PHONE ON 5TH JULY'13 (AWESOME FLIPKART DELIVERY SERVICE).....I PAID THE MONEY AS COD....BUT MY PHONE TURNED OUT TO BE FAULTY...IT WASN'T STARTING UP...I CALLED UP FLIPKART AND ASKED FOR A REPLACEMENT.......AND THE REPLACEMENT REACHED MY HOUSE THE NEXT DAY (AGAIN...AWESOME SERVICES)......
      
      
      BUT THEN THE TRAGEDIES STARTED.....THAT PHONE WAS OKAY IN THE BEGINNING FOR THE FIRST MONTH...BUT THEN THERE WAS SOME PROBLEM IN ITS SCREEN....I TOUCHED IT ON ONE PLACE AND IT GOT TOUCHED ON SOME OTHER.....I TOOK IT TO THE SERVICE CENTRE BECAUSE IT WAS STILL IN WARRANTY.....THEY KEPT MY PHONE FOR 4-5 DAYS AND THEN RETURNED IT BACK TO ME....
      
      
      THEN IT WORKED FINE FOR ANOTHER MONTH UNTIL THERE OCCURRED A PROBLEM IN ITS CHARGING POINT.....IT STOPPED GETTING CHARGED...I TOOK IT AGAIN TO THE SERVICE CENTRE.....I STILL HAVE THE JOB SHEET DATED 18TH SEPTEMBER....THEY SAID IT WOULD BE 20 DAYS TILL I GET MY PHONE BACK....GOD KNOWS WHEN THOSE 20 DAYS WOULD BE OVER...BECAUSE AS OF TODAY, 21ST JAN'14 , I HAVE STILL NOT GOT MY PHONE BACK....
      
      
      I CALLED THEM ON 10TH OCTOBER...THEY SAID 18 MORE DAYS.....
      
      I CALLED THEM ON 5TH NOVEMBER....THEY SAID 15 MORE DAYS....
      
      I CALLED THEM ON 18TH DECEMBER...THEY SAID 20 MORE DAYS....
      
      I CALLED THEM ON 14TH JANUARY...THEY SAID 10 MORE DAYS....
      
      I CALLED THEM TODAY ON 21ST JANUARY...THEY SAID 8 MORE DAYS....
      
      
      I AM TIRED OF CALLING THEM UP...I ASKED THE CUSTOMER CARE GIRL TO TRANSFER MY PHONE TO HER SENIOR...SHE SAYS SHE ISN'T AUTHORIZED TO DO THAT...I ASK HER WHEN WOULD THOSE 20 DAYS END??...SHE SAYS- ""HUM KUCH NAHI KR SKTE...AAPKA PHONE SERVICING K LIYE GYA HAI....CUSTOMER CARE WALE BS AAPKO REMAINING DAYS BATA SKTE HAIN ( WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING...YOUR PHONE IS GONE FOR SERVICING...WE CUSTOMER CARE PEOPLE CAN ONLY TELL YOU THE REMAINING DAYS)""
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE BECAUSE IT WAS PRICED 13000 AND IT HAD THE SAME SPECIFICATIONS AS SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND WORTH 16000-18000......BUT ALL THIS HEADACHE AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE HAS COST ME MORE THAN THOSE 4000 RS.
      
      
      I ASK MICROMAX PEOPLE....""WHAT IS THE USE OF A ONE YEAR WARRANTY IF OUT OF THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF MY PHONE, U HAVE KEPT IT WITH URSELF FOR 4 MONTHS..??...I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER I GET MY PHONE BACK....BUT ONE THING IS FOR SURE, I AM NEVER BUYING MICROMAX AGAIN..!!!....AND IF MY PHONE GETS ANY MORE PROBLEMS AFTER I GET IT ( I STILL HAVE SOME HOPES LEFT OF GETTING MY PHONE BACK, SO MUCH FOR BEING HOPEFUL...GOSH..!! ), I AM GONNA THROW IT DOWN THE GUTTER.....
      
      
      NOKIA PHONES WORK FOR YEARS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS...AND THIS ONE WORKED FOR A FEW WEEKS...MICROMAX SUCKS..!!...GO FOR MICROMAX ONLY IF YOU WANT TO BUY PHONES WORTH 2000-3000 WITH LARGE BATTERY BACKUP.......OR GO FOR MICROMAX IF U HAVE ENOUGH MONEY THAT U DONT CARE IF 13000 OF IT GOES DOWN THE GUTTER.....BUT I DO CARE FOR MY MONEY...
      
      
      IF U WANT ANDROID, GO FOR SONY/SAMSUNG/HTC....
      
      IF U WANT WINDOWS, GO FOR NOKIA LUMIA.....
      
      IF U WANT YOUR MONEY TO GET WASTED AND YOUR HEAD TO BLOW UP, GO FOR MICROMAX...!!!!
      
      
      P.S.: I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GIVE 1 STAR TO THIS...BUT I CAN'T HELP IT....GIVING NEGATIVE STARS IS NOT AN OPTION HERE....."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"NO DOUBT MICROMAX IS MAKING GOOD PHONE BUT I STILL ADVISE NOT TO BUY THESE PHONE BECAUSE AFTER SALE SERVICE BY COMPANY IS A BIG ZERO.IF YOU DON'T BUY I PHONE FROM GREY MARKET WITHOUT WARRANY YOU SHOULD AVOID BUYING THIS ALSO OR ELSE GO AHEAD AND SEE THE CONSEQUENCES. I AM SAYING THIS BECAUSE MY PHONE (CANVAS HD) IS IN SERVICE CENTRE SINCE I BOUGHT IT IN APRIL2013 ,AND I SAW THERE THAT ALL THE CANVAS OWNER ARE SHARING THE SAME PROBLEM.I THINK MICROMAX FAILED TO LIFT SERVICES OF SMART PHONES.I ,THEREFORE, WARN YOU TO THINK AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN BEFORE BUYING IT."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"ONE OF THE WORST PHONES THAT I HAVE PURCHASED.IT WAS A WATE OF RS.15,000 THAT I HAD SHELLED OUT IN BUYING THE PHONE.THE SERVICE CENTRES ARE WORST AND HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL.BESIDES,PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING THAT THEIR PHONES HAD PROBLEMS AFTER 10-15 DAYS OF PURCHASE.PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT.GO FOR SAMSUNG OR NOKIA."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"SERVICE FROM MICROMAX IS REALLY WORST.U GIVE UR MOBILE FOR SERVICE AND U WILL GET THE MOBILE AFTER A MONTH AND THAT TOO PROBLEM NOT RECTIFIED.FRANKLY SPEAKNING ,I BOUGHT THE A116 FROM FLIPKART NOW REALLY SUFFERING ALOT WITH DISPLAY PROBLEM.I HAVE GIVEN IT TO SERVICE CENTER AT AMEERPET,HYDERABAD 3 OR 4 TIMES.TODAY ALSO MY PHONE IS AT SERVICE CENTER.WHEN U SUBMIT UR PHONE THEY JUST ASK U TO ""WAIT FOR OUR MESSAGE TO UR MOBILE NUMBER.WHEN IT COMES COLLECT IT FROM OUR SERVICE.""OUT OF UR CURIOSITY IF U ASK FOR HOW MANY DAYS IT TAKES AND FOR FORMALTY THEY SAY U A WEEK....BUT A MINIMUM OF 20 DAYS WILL TAKE....JUST SAYING U ONE THING IF A PROBLEM ARRIVES ...FOR MICROMAX..JUST THROW IT IN DUSTBIN..."

      THAT IS WHY I DO NOT PREFER THESE CHEAP ALTERNATIVES LIKE MICROMAX"
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"THE CELL PHONE IS VERY SLOW AND IT HANGS OFTEN DOES NOT HAVE COMPASS HENCE NO NAVIGATION NO MAP USE IN NAVIGATION NO DETECTION OF DIRECTION. ALSO READ BELOW POINTS BASED ON EXPERIENCE. DISPLAY ? IT HAS HD IPS DISPLAY, YET THE DISPLAY QUALITY AS NOT AS GOOD AS FEATURED HIGH-END SMARTPHONE. IT IS NOT A DUAL ACTIVE, BUT DUAL STANDBY HANDSET. YOU CAN SET CALL FORWARD - WHEN SIM1 BUSY, FORWARD CALL TO SIM2 AND VICE VERSA. THIS WAY YOU WILL GET INCOMING CALL ALERT WHEN YOU ARE USING ANY ONE OF THE SIM."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"THE MOST DISGRACE THING IN INDIA IS TO BUY MICROMAX PRODUCT OF CELL PHONES AND TABLETS.
      
      BECAUSE OF ITS LOWER PRICE AND SIMILAR FEATURES OF RENOWNED COMPANY PHONES,INDIAN  CUSTOMERS ARE CROWDING TO BUY THESE PRODUCTS JUST AFTER ONE MONTH BUYING THE PHONE AS THEY CROWDED THE SHOP FOR PURCHASING THEY ARE CROWING AT REPAIR CENTRE, THESEBEAUSE THE  CHEAP PRODUCT WILL NOT STAND GOOD AT MARKET.THESE MICROMAX CAN BE EAQUALLY COMPARED TO OUR OWN DELHI MADE ELECTRONIC GOODS PURCHASED AT CHANDNI CHOWK MARKET.
      
      I REQUEST FELLOW INDIANS NOT TO ENCOURAGE SUCH A CHEAP PHONE  TO  APPEAR  IN THE  MARKET.
      
      THESE HARSE REVIEW  IS DUE TO SELF EXPERIENCE BY BUYING TWO MICROMAX A116 WITH THE GAP OF 45 DAYS AND VANISHING OF DISPLAY BECOME COMMON COMPLAINT. 2 TIME AFTER PURCHASING THE PHONE FLASHING WAS NECESSARY. THE WAY THE LITTLE STUDIED TECHNICIANS BE HAVE AT THE REPAIR SHOP AT AMBATTUR,CHENNAI IS UNBEAREABLE. THE BEHAVE MORE THAN THE LIFE SAVING SURGEONS IN GOVT. HOSPITALS. WHWN I HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT MYNEWLY PURCHASED PHONE
      
      IRRITTANTINGLY, THE TECHNICIAN AT THE MICROMAX OWNED REPAIRING SHOP SAYS""GIVIT AND GO AND COME AFTER 15 DAYS WE WILL  TELL YOU THE PROGRESS"" THEY NEVER GIVE ANY THING IN WRITING AS NO ORDER IS ISSUED AS SUCH.
      
      
      WHY I AM WIRTING THIS IN THE REVIEW MEANS, ONE SHOULD BE AWARE HOW THE AFTER SALES SERVICE IS BY THE CHINA  OWNED MICROMAX COMPANY.I GAVE MY COMPLAINT TO THE
      
      CUSTOMER CARE  AND AWAITING FOR THEIR REPLY

      I DECIDED TO BUY A MICROMAX A116 ON 5TH OF THIS MONTH BECAUSE I LIKED THE PHONE VERY MUCH. I WAS ON MY BUSINESS TOUR SO DECIDED TO GO AND BUY THE PHONE FROM THE NEAREST STORE IN HARIHAR, KARNATAKA. I WAS HAPPY USING THE PHONE AS THE CLARITY WAS AMAZING.
      
      
      ON 13TH OF JULY I WAS BACK IN BANGALORE AND I DECIDED TO CHARGE MY PHONE. TO MY SHOCK THE PHONE WAS NOT CHARGING. ALL OF A SUDDEN IT STOPPED CHARGING FOR NO REASON. I GAVE THE PHONE TO YOUR SERVICE CENTER IN BANGALORE, OVER COMMUNICATION ON THE SAME DAY. HOW CAN A PHONE STOP CHARGING WITHOUT ANY REASON??? JUST 8 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE??
      
      
      THE PROBLEM STARTED WHEN THE SERVICE CENTER WAS SO CROWDED AND THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO HAD GIVEN THEIR PHONES FOR SERVICING 25 DAYS TO 30 DAYS AGO!! THE LADY IN THE OFFICE TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD TAKE 25 DAYS FOR ME TO GET MY PHONE BACK!!! I DID NOT GET THE PLEASURE TO USE THE PHONE FOR 10 DAYS AND THE SERVICE STATION WANTS IT FOR 25 DAYS??

      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON MAY21-2013...IT WAS WORKING AWESOME....BUT SUDDENLY AFTER 25 DAYS OF USE...SOME LINES CAME UP ON SCREEN. AND WHEN I WENT TO SERVICE CENTER THEY SAID IT WILL TAKE 20-25 DAY, THEY KEPT MY PHONE FOR 10 DAYS AND THEN RETURNED IT TO ME AND SAID WE WILL CALL YOU ONCE WE RECIEVE THE DISPLAY SCREEN FROM MICROMAX, AND NOW IT'S ALMOST 1.5MONTHS I DIDN'T GOT A SINGLE CALL FROM THEM, AND WHEN I CALL THEM THEY SAY ""SIR IT WILL TAKE SOME MORE DAYS BUT THEY DON'T SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF DAYS MORE .....
      
      
      I HATE MICROMAX SERVICE....
      
      
      TELL MICROMAX ..LAUNCHING GOOD PHONES WILL NOT WORK....THEY NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING CALLED AS ""CUSTOMER SATISFACTION"""
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"TRUE FROM MY EXPERIANCE THE PRODUCT IS GOOD IN TERMS OF PRICE BUT NOT MORE THAN CHEAP CHINESE TOY AND THE WORST PART IS SERVICE . I NEVER IMAGINE SUCH A UNORGANISED AND ILLLITERATE MANPOWER ANY HANDSET COMPANY CAN OFFER.
      
      
      OVERALL GO FOR SOME GOOD BRANDED PRODUCT LIKE SAMSUNG, NOKIA,BB BUT NOT MICROMAX.
      
      
      ITS REALLY MICRO IN TERMS OF QUALITY."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"UNACCEPTABLE BATTERY LIFE, ISSUES WITH SIGNAL STRENGTH. MY OTHER OLD PHONE SHOWS AND WORKS WITH 3G, BUT AT THE SAME PLACE/TIME, THIS PHONE DOES NOT SHOW 3G NETWORK. THIS CAN BE POSSIBLE ONLY WITH INTERNAL ISSUES WITH THE PHONE. LOOKS ARE ATTRACTIVE, PHONE FEELS GOOD.. BUT I THINK WE USE PHONE TO USE AND NOT JUST FOR FASHION. STAY AWAY FROM LOW COST PHONE.. BETTER SPEND FEW THOUSAND MORE AND BUY BETTER PHONES EITHER FROM SAME BRAND/MANUFACTURER OR ANOTHER, YOUR CHOICE."
Micromax Canvas HD A116,1,"WAS USING THIS PHONE FOR THE PAST 9 MONTHS AND SUDDENLY, THE TOUCH SCREEN STOPPED WORKING.
      
      
      COUPLE HARD REBOOTS LATER, I AM STUCK AT THE LOGO.
      
      
      TRIED CHECKING THE WEB, NO INFORMATION ON THE RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE. GUESS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU BUY A CHEAP PHONE THAT NO ONE CARES ENOUGH TO MAKE CUSTOM ROM.
      
      
      DREADING THE VISIT TO THEIR SERVICE CENTER, WHICH, IN A CITY LIKE BANGALORE, IS JUST ONE!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"1 MONTH AGO I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AND THIS PHONE IS FAR BETTER THEN OTHER BRANDS, WORKING FINE..  GREAT LOOKS, FAST, VERY GOOD DISPLAY.. DON'T THINK TWICE, TRUST ME YOU'LL NEVER GONNA REGRET THIS DEAL."

Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"ANYONE PLANNING TO BUY A SMARTPHONE, JUST GO BY MY RECOMMENDATION. SIMPLY EXCELLENT PHONE. DO NOT GO FOR THE COMBO OFFER CARRY CASE AND SCRATCH GUARD. THEY BOTH WERE OF POOR QUALITY. JUST A WOOW EXPERIENCE"

      FOR THE PHONE.... I WOULD SAY ITS AWESOME.. AND GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT... I DIDN'T FIND ANY PHONE WHICH IS SO GOOD IN LESS THAN 30K BUDGET..."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"AT TIME OF WRITING, THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PHONES IN THE SUB-20K RANGE WITH 2GB RAM. PRACTICAL USAGE IS EFFORTLESS. APART FROM THE SPECS AND PRICE, THE BEST PART WAS THE LOOKS. GO FOR THE WHITE COLOUR."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,AWESOME PHONE ... NO ONE CAN BEAT THIS MOBILE IN THIS RANGE OF PRICE.. AWESOME LOOK WITH NICE BATTERY BACKUP.. FLIPKART GIVES YOU THE BEST PRICE FOR ANY PRODUCT .. I M FULLY SATISFIED..
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"AWESOME SCREEN AVERAGE BATTERY BACKUP WITH NET (COMES MORE THEN 14HRS WITHOUT NET).
      
      WITH NET STAYS ON FOR ABOUT 6-7HRS.
      
      NO LAG IN GAMING, ALTHOUGH FOUND ABIT LAG IN CAMERA BUT GUESS ITS A SOFTWARE BUG N MIGHT GO WITH UPDATE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"BEFORE BUYING THIS MOBILE I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH AND I FINALLY CAME DOWN TO THIS PRODUCT.
      
      ITS BEEN A MONTH AND I HAVE GOT NO PROBLEMS WITH THE PHONE WHATSOEVER.AND MICROMAX HATERS PLS USE THIS PRODUCT BEFORE COMMENTING. I DONT UNDERSTAND THE REASON FOR THEIR HATENESS. COMMON JUST BECAUSE OF THE NAME U CANT SAY ITS BAD.
      
      
      PHONE BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD AND OVERRALL PERFORMANCE IS ALSO GOOD.(KINDLY DONT COMPARE IT WITH S4 OR APPLE).I LIKE DS PRODUCT AND WILL NOT TYPE THE SPECS AND PROS ABOUT IT.
      
      
      WELL I JUST FIGURED OUT SOME CONS WHICH U MIGHT WANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
      
      1.I HAVE INSTALLED SOME GAMES LIKE DEAD TRIGGER,REAL RACING,TEMPLE RUN2 ,SUBWAYS SURFERS,CLASH OF CLANS,ETC.AND THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE TOUCH AND ALL EXCPET FOR A MINOR LAGS HERE AND THERE.ITS NOT DAT U CANNOT PLAY BUT SOMETIMES IT LAGS IN HIGH GRAPHIC INTENSIVE GAMES LIKE REAL RACING 4 AND DEAD TRIGGER 2.
      
      
      2.INTERNAL MEMORY ONLY 1GB FOR APPS--YES YOU CAN MOVE STUFFS TO INTERNAL SD CARD BUT SOME APPS REMAINS IN THE PHONE MEMORY.
      
      
      3.REAR CAMERA IS NOT UPTO THE MARK FOR 13MP.
      
      
      OTHERWISE ITS WORTH A DEAL IN 17K(I BROUGHT IT DURING GOSF OFFER).
      
      HOPE THE PHONE CONTINUES TO WORK WELL EVEN AFTER MONTHS OF USAGE.
      
      HEARD THAT 4.4 UPDATE ALSO COMING TO ALL THE CANVAS SERIES PHONE.
      
      
      AND YES PEOPLE WILL SAY  DONT GO FOR MICROMAX BUT I SAY U ATLEAST GO AND CHECK IN  STORE AND THEN DECIDE.ATLLAST ITS MONEY YOU DECIDE WHAT TO DO .AND ITS NOT WORTH GOING FOR A MOBILE WORTH 30 OR 40K.AFTER ALL ITS JUST A MOBILE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"BOUGHT DURING XMAS SALES... FLIPKART SERVICE WAS SUPERB..
      
      
      PHONE IS GREAT... GOOD PERFORMANCE... BATTER IS NICE... NO LAG.
      
      STEAL IN PRICE"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"BOUGHT THE PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART ONLY, GOT IT IN 3 DAYS.. USING IT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS NOW.. THE BEST PH BELOW THE 20,000 RANGE.. FRONT CAMERA IS SUPERB.. BACK CAMERA IS ALSO VERY GOOD.. MICROMAX HAS IMPROVED THEIR CAMERAS AND IT SHOWS IN THE TURBO.. SUPERB DISPLAY QUALITY..
      
      DONT GO FOR BRAND NAMES AND BUY S3 OR OR NEXUS4 WHICH R OF  25,000 INSTEAD GO FOR THIS PH.. ITS WORTH YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.. :)"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"BOUGHT THIS MOBILE A MONTH BACK AND I WOULD SAY AFTER A MONTH, I'M DELIGHTED TO OWN THIS SMARTPHONE.
      
      
      POSITIVES:
      
      
      1) TURBO AS THE NAME SUGGESTS ITS REALLY FAST. THANKS TO 2 GB RAM.
      
      2) BATTERY IS ALSO GOOD, IT LASTS 2 DAYS (AVERAGE USAGE) AND 1 DAY WITH HEAVY USAGE (PLEASE NOTE THAT I ALWAYS KEEP 3G SWITCHED ON)
      
      3) I COULDN'T SEE ANY LAGS WHILE PLAYING GAMES (EVEN A 50 MB GAME). YET TO CHECK WITH SOME MORE BIG GAMES.
      
      4) EVEN AFTER LOADING SO MANY APPS, I STILL HAVE 1 GB RAM MEMORY FREE, WHICH IS EXCELLENT.
      
      5) SLIM AND SLEEK BUILT, WHILE HAVING MOBILE IN YOUR HAND, YOU COULD NEVER FEEL THAT IT ACTUALLY IS.
      
      6) EVEN THOUGH THE MEMORY FOR INSTALLING APPS IS ONLY 1 GB, YOU CAN MOVE THE APPS TO INTERNAL SD CARD.
      
      7) 13 MP CAMERA IS EXCELLENT. IT ALSO HAS THE CAPABILITY TO FOCUS EXACTLY THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO.
      
      
      NEGATIVES:
      
      
      1) GETS HEATED A BIT WHILE WATCHING VIDEOS OR PLAYING GAMES (EVERY PHONE DOES, BELIEVE ITS DUE TO THE ALUMINIUM BODY)
      
      2) IF THE MEMORY COULD HAVE BEEN 32 GB INSTEAD OF 16 THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF THIS WORLD PHONE.
      
      
      VERDICT: OVERALL ITS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT THIS MOBILE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MOBILE WITH 15 K BUDGET, THEN PLS PUT AN EXTRA 2 K AND GO FOR THIS. TRUST ME, YOU WOULD BE DELIGHTED :) CHEERS!!"

Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,EXCELLENT MOBILE WITH REASONABLE PRICE. FEATURES OF THIS MOBILE SAME AS SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE-III. VERY SLIM AND LOOKS AWESOME.
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"FIRST IMPRESSION WHEN I OPENED THE BOX WAS WOW. ITS REALLY GOOD LOOKING PHONE. I BOUGHT WHITE COLOR, IT HAS SILVER COLOR BODY. LOOKS PREMIUM. ALL THE ACCESSORIES ARE GOOD QUALITY WHITE COLOR. HEAD PHONE, CHARGER ETC LOOKS PREMIUM WITH FLAT STYLE CABLE.
      
      
      I HAVE SAMSUNG NOTE 1 SO I ALWAYS KEEP COMPARING THIS WITH NOTE 1. IT IS MORE POWERFUL AND GOOD LOOKING THANK SAMSUNG NOTE 1.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      AWESOME SCREEN. REALLY GOOD, FULL HD SCREE. COLORS ARE AWESOME, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT.
      
      POWERFUL PROCESSOR
      
      GOOD SOUND. VERY CLEAR VERY CRISP.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      ONLY 1 GB MEMORY FOR APPLS INSTALLATION, I AM VERY HEAVY USER AND AFTER INSTALLING 25 TO 30 APPS THE MEMORY WAS FULL. THEN I MOVED SOME OF THE APPS TO INTERNAL SD MEMORY WHICH IS APPROX 15GB. BUT NOT ALL APPS CAN BE MOVED. SO ONE DAY WILL COME WHEN I WILL HAVE TO UNINSTALL SOME APPS WHICH ARE NOT NEEDED OR OF LESS PRIORITY.
      
      
      INTERNAL 2000MAH BATTERY. HOPE AFTER ONE YEAR OF USAGE MICROMAX WILL NOT CHARGE HUGE AMOUNT FOR REPLACEMENT OF BATTERY :)
      
      
      NO LAG IN GAMES LIKE SUBWAY SURFER, TEMPLE RUN ETC. ABOUT MORE ADVANCE 3D GAMES I AM NOT SURE YET.
      
      BATTERY: I HAVE USED IT FOR 3 TO 4 HOURS HEAVY USAGE, INSTALLED 1GB OF APPS IN 3 HOURS ON WI-FI AND BATTERY WAS EXHAUSTED. IF YOU ARE HEAVY USER OR GAMER YOU WILL NEED POWER BANK FOR SURE IF YOUR ARE TRAVELING.
      
      
      ALL  IN ALL GOOD PRODUCT FOR AROUND 17K.
      
      LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, I GIFTED THIS TO MY WIFE AND SHE WAS HAPPY AFTER SEEING THE PRODUCT QUALITY.

Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"FIRST OF ALL I DON'T WANT TO THANK FOR FLIPKART, IT TAKES 5 DAYS TO DELIEVER THE PRODUCT(I DONT GET IN 2 DAYS LIKE OTHERS GET)
      
      NOW THE PRODUCT REVIEW
      
      MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS
      
      1: HOW CAN THE PHONE WHICH IS 5 INCH SCREEN CAN BE AS LIGHT WEIGHT! (MY FRIENDS ALSO SHOCKED BY ITS WEIGHT).
      
      2: THOUGH IT GOT LARGE SCREEN BUT, IT FITS COMFORTABLY IN YOUR PALMS.
      
      3: ITS GOT STUNNING FULL-HD DISPLAY, AND ALSO FEELS THE SAME(I AM ENJOYING VIDEOS, GAMES AND BROWSING ALSO)
      
      4:PERFORMACE LIKE BATTERY AND CAMERA ARE DECENT
      
      5: GIVES GREAT SPEED FOR BROWSING(IF U USE 3G)
      
      6: AND ONE LAST THING (VALUE FOR MONEY)
      
      CONS:
      
      1: DONT PURCHASE THIS PHONE IN EXAM PERIOD (BECAUSE IF U BUY THIS, THEN U WILL GET ADDICTED TO THIS)"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"FIRSTLY I WAS BIT APPREHENDED FOR BUYING MICROMAX, BUT AFTER PURCHASING THE SAME, IT IS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE TILL NOW. THE LOOKS, SIZE, WEIGHT, POWER AND ITS DISPLAY, ALL ARE BRILLIANT IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH ITS CONTEMPORARIES LIKE SAMSUNG. 1.5 GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR  SUPPORTED BY 2 GB RAM RUNS SMOOTHLY.OVERALL AWSOME PHONE AT THIS PRICE.

NO NEED TO OPEN PHONE FOR INSERTING NEW SIM CARDS."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"HI EVERYONE,
      
      THIS IS MY FIRST EVER EXPERIENCE WITH MICROMAX &AMP; UNTIL BEFORE I ALSO THOUGHT JST LIKE ANY OTHER 2ND/3RD GUY THAT MICROMAX IS NOT A BRAND &AMP; ITS A LOCAL CO.

I SEARCHED LOTS OF PHONES &AMP; AT LAST THIS PHONE GAVE ALL THE THINGS THAT I WANTED &AMP; ALSO THANKS TO FLIPKART THAT DELIVERS THE PHONE WITHIN 2 DAYS. VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE.
      
      NOW ABOUT PHONE...
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD. IT LASTS FOR ABOUT A DAY WITH MEDIUM TO HEAVY USE.
      
      
      2GB RAM NEVER MAKES UR PHONE TO LEG. U CAN DO BROWSING, PLAY GAMES &AMP; LISTEN SONGS TO GATHER W/O ANY PROBLEM.
      
      
      SOUND IS SWEET TO UR EARS, NOT SO LOUD &AMP; NOT SO LOW.
      
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY IS FIX(16GB) BUT THATS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME.I HAVE AROUND 200 SONGS &AMP; 3-4 HD MOVIES(EACH ~700 MB) BUT STILL I HAVE 3-4 GB SPACE IS AVAILABLE WHICH IS SUFFICIENT.
      
      
      5"" SCREEN IS AWESOME WITH ~440 PPI, ITS ALWAYS NICE TO SEE IMAGES, VIDEOS &AMP; OUTSIDE IN A SUNNY DAY, BRIGHTNESS IS AWESOME.
      
      
      FEATURES LYK I-FLOAT IS AWESOMEEE. I LV THIS FEATURE.

      SO AT THE END I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS PHONE WITH THESE FEATURES IS A VERY VERY GOOD DEAL UNDER 20K RANGE. DONT MISS TIS &AMP; IF U HV A MIND SET OF BRANDED PHONE, THN WITH THESE FEATURES U HV TO PAY ABOVE 30K. I GAURANTEED."

      BATTERY : IT COMES FOR A WHOLE DAY WITH MEDIUM USAGE ( 2G/3G/WIFI IS ON THE WHOLE DAY WITHE PLAYING FOR LIKE 45MIN TO A HOUR,AND NORMAL USAGE INCLUDING WATS APP ETC) BUT IF U R A HEAVY USER U CAN ALWAYS BUY A EXTERNAL BATTERY CHARGER FOR LIKE 1K

Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"I BOUGHT THE PHONE ON FLIPCART FOR 16.3K AND IT IS AMAZING :D .THIS PHONE DIDN'T RAN OUT OF BATTERY FOR EVEN A DAY. THE ONLY CON I FOUND ON THIS DEVICE IS THAT IT MAKES A SLIGHTLY BUZZING SOUND WHILE WE PAUSE THE MUSIC WHEN THE GIVEN HEADPHONE IS CONNECTED(PHONE DOSENT MAKES IT WE HEAR IT THROUGH THE HEADPHONE),THIS IS ONLY WITH THE MICROMAX HEADSET.I USE SONY MDR-XB400 AND AM A BASS ADDICT, THE INBUILT MUSIC APP IS GOOD.LET ME TELL U YOU CANT FIND THESE SPECS IN SAMSUNG ,NOKIA,NEXUS LG,FOR A BETTER PRICE"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"I FIND FOLLOWING TWO LIMITATIONS AND REST ALL FEATURES ARE OKAY.
      
      IT LOOKS LIKE BRIGHTNESS DISPLAY IS SOMEWHAT LESS COMPARE TO OTHER SMART-PHONES.

      FLIPKART ROCKS, THE SHIPMENT WAS DELIVERED IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. I PAID 90RS FOR EXPESS SHIPMENT. BUT ITS WORTH. 10/10 TO FLIPKART.
      
      ABOUT PHONE: ITS WORKING AS FAST AS LIGHTINING. NO LAG AT ALL. AWSOME MEMORY SPACE 16 GB. THE MOST IMPORTANT FETURE OF THE PHONE IS THE ON THE GO USB CONNECTION. YOU CAN CONNECT YOUR PEN DRIVE AND NAVIGATE IT THROGH YOUR PHONE. BRILLIANT.

      2) I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH  THE BUILD QUALITY OF THE PHONE ,CAMERA IS REALLY GOOD BOTH REAR AND FRONT.. FRONT COULD VE BEEN BETTER.
      
      3) YEAH IT HAS .001 OF LAG IN SOME CASES OF HEAVY MULTITASKING... OTHERWISE DEVICE IS AWSOME AND SMOOTH ...VERY HANDY....LOOKS GOOD IN HAND
      
      4) THE INBUILT AAPS ARE GOOD AND THE GAMES THEY COULD AVE GIVEN  A FULL VERSION INSTEAD OF TRIAL..
      
      5) EARPHONES ARE GOOD IN QUALITY BUT SOUND COULD VE BEEN MUCH BETTER.. BUT WE CANT ACCEPT EVERYTHING FROM ""MICROMAX"" .. STILL UP TO THE MARK.. U CAN USE SKULLCANDY OR OTHER HEADSET IF U R A SOUND FREAK..
      
      6) IN ALL AMAZING PHONE WITH ALL IN ONE PACKAGE ...
      
      I'LL RATE THIS PHONE 4.5/5 AS IT HAS SOME QUALITIES THAT COULD VE BEEN BETTER...

      PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE,I HAD COMPARED ALMOST ALL THE BRANDS LIKE INTEX,XOLO,GIONEE GIVING THE SAME FEATURES SUCH AS FHD,1.5 GHZ PROCESSOR,2 GB RAM,13 MP CAMERA.BUT THE LOOK AND FEEL OF MMX TURBO IS FAR BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS.
      
      THE BATTERY NEEDS TO BE CHARGED ONCE EVERYDAY WHICH IS NOT A ISSUE.THE CAMERA TAKES CRISP PICTURES IN FULL LIGHT AND A LITTLE GRAINY IN LOW LIGHT.SMOOTH GAMING EXPERIENCE.NO LAGS IN TOUCH.
      
      I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."

I BOUGHT IT FROM FLIPCART FEW DAYS BACK. EARLIER USING SONY AND SAMSUNG AFTER MANY RND ON NUMBER OF SITES AND REVIEWS, THEN I CAME TO THE POINT THAT MACROMAX TURBO 250 IS THE BEST.
      
      
      SOME POINTS WHERE SOMEONE WILL NOT SATISFY BECAUSE OF IN-BUILD MEMORY. RATHER THAN THAT IT?S FANTASTIC. WHAT ELSE IS REQUIRED IN THIS SEGMENT WITH THIS MRP??"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,5,"IT'S A GOOD SMARTPHONE.... AS SUCH AM ALL ABOUT SONY...YET DUE MY PRICE CONSTRAINTS I HAD TO CHOOSE A PHONE WHICH SERVES MY HOBBY OF 'CLICKING' AND ALSO ALLOWS ME TO DO MY DAILY NOTES AND UPDATES.

      EVEN IF IT HANGS, IT COULD BE BOUGHT TO NORMAL BY PRESSING THE POWER BUTTON FOR 15-20 SECONDS
      
      ONLY THING THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT LIKE IS ITS UN-EXPANDABLE MEMORY.. BUT FOR ME 12GB IS ENOUGH!!
      
      1000X BETTER THEN SPENDING MONEY ON OTHER BRANDS WHO SELL THEIR MODELS FOR A RS.40,000+ FOR SAME ALMOST FEATURES

Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"1) FLIPKART DELIVERED THIS IN A DAY. GREAT JOB.
      
      2) GOT THE PRODUCT IN EXCELLENT CONDITION
      
      3) FEELS LIKE A HIGH END SMARTPHONE EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE PAYING ALMOST HALF OF THE PRICE.
      
      4) NICE BIG SCREEN SIZE OF 5 INCH.
      
      5) LIKED THE WHITE COLOR AS IT FEELS LIKE A IPHONE THAT USUALLY ARE SEEN IN WHITE. CAPACITIVE BUTTONS (HOME, SETTINGS, BACK) NOT SHOWING UP NICELY AS IT GETS OVERSHADOWED BY THE WHITE COLOR OF THE PHONE. THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN BLACK COLOR. MAY BE IT IS A DEFECT IN MY PHONE.
      
      6) INTERNAL SD MEMORY OF 16 GB IS MOSTLY SUFFICIENT FOR ME TO STORE VIDEOS, APPS AND PHOTOS. WOULD HAVE PREFERRED EXPANDABLE MEMORY TO STORE MORE.
      
      7) PROCESSOR IS VERY GOOD. I CAN PLAY MOST OF THE POPULAR GAMES WITHOUT ANY DELAYS.
      
      8) CAMERA PHOTO QUALITY IS GOOD. COLORS ARE VIBRANT. IT BECOMES HAZY WHEN USING FLASH. MAY BE IT IS A DEFECT IN MY PARTICULAR PHONE.
      
      9) VIDEO PLAYBACK QUALITY IS EXCELLENT ESPECIALLY FOR HD VIDEOS. COLORS ARE VIBRANT.
      
      10) NON-REMOVABLE BATTERY IS A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY IF IT HANGS AND IT DOES NOT REBOOT WITH POWER KEY. BATTERY DRAINING OUT FASTER THAN EXPECTED. NOT SURE IF IT IS BECAUSE OF TOO MANY RUNNING APPS.
      
      
      OVERALL HAPPY WITH PHONE EXCEPT FOR FEW ISSUES/DEFECTS. IT IS VALUE FOR MONEY. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STAR RATING IF THESE ISSUES/DEFECTS WERE NOT THERE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"100% DISAPPOINT IS WITHOUT MICRO SD CARD SLOT
      
      
      NOT WORTHY CLARITY ON 16MP CAMERA IMAGES.
      
      
      LITTLE BIG, NOT COMPACT WITH HAND."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"ABOUT FLIPKART- NICE SERVICE...
      
      ABOUT PHONE- WELL..!! IT IS AWESOME MEDITAKE IS DOING GOOD UNDER THE HOOD..."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"AS OF NOW IT IS WORKING FINE WITHOUT ANY GLITCHES OR HANGING HOWEVER WITH THIS PROCESSING SPEED IT REQUIRES MORE BATTERY POWER. WHEN THE SCREEN IS ON IT CONSUMES BATTERY QUITE FAST. EXCEPT THIS, OTHER OVERALL PERFORMANCE IS VERY GOOD,FOR THE PRICE PAID. GO AHEAD AND PURCHASE THIS PHONE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AS SHE NEEDED A DUAL SIM AND I DID PLAY AROUND WITH IT FOR COUPLE OF HOURS AND I HAVE TO SAY, I WAS IMPRESSED. THE PHONE AS THE NAME SUGGESTED WAS QUICK AND HAD NO LAGS, THE DISPLAY WAS GOOD, FEEL WAS PREMIUM, OVERALL A GOOD EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      ONLY ISSUE MY WIFE HAS BROUGHT OUT IS THE BATTERY, NOT SURE IF THAT IS DUE TO HER FLUCTUATING MOBILE NETWORK (SHE WORKS IN RURAL AREAS) OR THE PHONE BATTERY ITSELF.
      
      
      FINALLY, MICROMAX HAVE IMPROVED LEAPS AND BOUNDS AND THIS PHONE IS INDEED A GOOD PRODUCT AND THE NEW PRICE CLOSE TO 14-15K, IT IS A GREAT BUY."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"BUYED IT FOR 16.3K. I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR LIKE 2 WEEKS. THERE HASN'T BEEN THE NEED OF SUPPORT SERVICE YET. AND THE PHONE LOOKS AND FEEL ARE LIKE PREMIUM PHONES GIVING 1080 DISPLAY, ETC. IT HAS A METALLIC COVER SO YOU KNOW THE FEEL.. THE ANDROID USER INTERFACE PERFORMS FAST AND GAMES ARE RUNNING FINE TILL NOW.
      
      THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE IS THAT IT DOES NOT SUPPORTS EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD. BUT I GUESS YOUR MUSIC AND PHOTOS AND APPLICATION DATA WILL ALMOST FIT IN THE 12GB. FOR EXTRA ENTERTAINMENT YOU CAN USE THE OTG AND PENDRIVES TO HAVE MORE STORAGE ! {[NOT SURE, HAVEN'T THE OTG USED YET. BUT SINCE ITS THE FLAGSHIP, I GUESS IT WILL SUPPORT]}
      
      .
      
      BOTTOM LINE - IT IS A GOOD AND BEST BUY OPTION IF YOU WANT TO BUY A PHONE AROUND RS 15,000 OR +1,000 .. ENJOY !!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"BUYED IT FOR 16.3K. USING IT FOR LIKE 2 WEEKS.. TILL NOW EXPERIENCE IS VERY GOOD. NO TIME LAGS SEEN YET WHILE GENERAL USE OR GAMING.. THE INTERFACE IS SMOOTH AND THE BODY LOOKS AND FEEL LIKE PREMIUM WITH METAL COVERS.
      
      THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE I DISCOVERED IS THAT, - THERE'S NO SUPPORT FOR EXTERNAL MEMORY SD CARD. BUT I GUESS IT WILL FIT YOUR PHOTOS, MUSIC, APP DATA IN THE 12 GB PROVIDED. AND FOR EXTRA ENTERTAINMENT DATA LIKE MOVIES YOU CAN USE YOUR OTG AND PENDRIVE.. [[ HAVEN'T USED THE OTG YET, BUT I GUESS ITS THE FLAGSHIP OF MICROMAX AND WILL HAVE THE SUPPORT ! ]]
      
      !! BUT DON'T BUY IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KEEPING A LONG LIST OF APPS AND GAMES EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT USING THEM AND IF YOU WANT ALL YOUR DATA ON THE PHONE ITSELF !!
      
      ..
      
      BOTTOM LINE- IT IS A GOOD AND NEAR' BEST BUY OPTION IF YOU WANT A PHONE AROUND RS 15,000   1,000.."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"CONS - BETTRY BAKE UP IS TOO MUCHH MUCH MUCHH LOW.ONLY 3 HR IF FULLY CHARGE.
      
      
      I USE TURBO LAST TWO WEEK....IT BODY IS SLEEK N SLEEM,DISPLY QUALITY COMARE TO OTHER BRAND IS GOOD CONSIDER TO MONEY.....GAMING PERFORMANCE IS GOOD I RUN ASPHALT 8 (1.5 GB).....THRER WAS NO ANY BUG OR LAG WHILE PLAYING GAME.AND RAM IS HALF EMPTY...SO WE ENJOY DIFFERENT APPS.SPPED IS FAST AND NO STICK."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"EXCELLENT PHONE IN THE PRICE RANGE. BATTERY IS SAME AS OTHER ANDROID PHONES CONSUMING LOT OF BATTERY .FLIPKART WAS AWESOME AS IT HAS BEEN IN DELIVERING SAFE PRODUCT.

Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"EXPERIENCE AS OF NOW IS GOOD ESPECIALLY THE CAMERAS, BUT THERE ARE ONLY TWO PROBLEMS. THE MOB BECOMES SLOW WITH MORE APPS INSTALLED AND AT TIMES IT GETS HANGED.
      
      
      SOME QUERIES, HOW DO I INSTALL A GOOD ANTIVIRUS(NOT PIRATED ONE BUT ORIGINAL) AND WHICH ONE SHOULD I INSTALL AMONG VARIOUS OPTIONS THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET. CAN I GET CONTACT DETAILS OF MICROMAX SHOWROOM CENTERS IN MUMBAI AND NAVI MUMBAI."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"FAST PROCESSING, BEAUTIFUL SCREEN, LOOKS GOOD AND FEELS BETTER. BOTH CAMERAS ARE EXCELLENT. NO HANGING PROBLEMS.
      
      BATTERY BACK-UP IS VERY LOW. IT CAN BE TOUGH TO SQUEEZE OUT EVEN ONE FULL DAY. ALSO, TAKES AN ETERNITY TO CHARGE AGAIN."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"FIRSTLY HATS OFF TO FLIPKART DELIVERY AGAIN. I HAVE PURCHASED A LOT OF ITEMS FROM THIS SITE, AND ALWAYS I FOUND ITS DELIVERY QUICKEST.

      FROM MY POINT OF VIEW ONLY DRAWBACKS ARE ONLY 12.4 GB IN BUILT MEMORY FOR USE, NO EXTENDABLE MEMORY PORT AND MICRO SIM PORTS.
      
      
      ALTHOUGH SOUND IS ALSO NOT OF VERY HIGH STANDARD BUT IT'S ALSO NOT VERY BAD.

      NOT EXPANDABLE MEMORY ONLY 16GB
      
      BATTERY NOT REMOVABLE ITS FIXED ONE"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"GOT MY PHONE FOUR DAYS AFTER PLACING THE ORDER,
      
      THE PHONE COMES IN SMALL COMPACT CONTAINER AND LOOKS AND FEELS GREAT.
      
      THE PHONE IS LIGHT AND SLEEK. THE BUILD QUALITY IS AMAZING.
      
      THE PROS,
      
      1) THE CAMERA IS SIMPLY AMAZING.. THE PICTURES ARE SHARP AND CLEAR.. THE HD RECORDING IS ALSO OF BRILLIANT QUALITY.. IT ALSO COMES WITH A BUILT IN EDITING APP THAT HELPS LIVEN UP THE IMAGES.
      
      2) THE COMBINATION OF THE QUADCORE PROCESSOR AND THE 2GIG RAM MAKES IT VERY SMOOTH, THE TOUCH INTERFACE IS VERY NICE. NO OTHER PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE OFFERS A 2 GIG RAM.
      
      3) PRICE - NUFF SAID. NOTHING PACKS SO MANY FEATURES FOR SUCH A PRICE.
      
      4)SOUND QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD.
      
      
      THE CONS,
      
      
      1) COMES WITH THE 4.2 JELLYBEAN OS EVEN THOUGH THE ANDROID KITKAT 4.4.1 IS IN THE MARKET. THOUGH ITS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THIS PHONE WILL BE GETTING AN UPDATE, THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN OFFICIAL WORD FROM MMX.
      
      2)THIS IS A DUAL SIM PHONE IN STAND BY MODE. THAT IS WHEN ONE SIM IS BEING USED FOR MAKING A CALL OR GPRS, THE OTHER SIM WILL BE ""NOT REACHABLE"".
      
      3)THE SPACE ALLOTTED FOR INSTALLING APPS IS ONLY 0.98GB WHICH OF COURSE CAN BE OVERCOME WITH ROOTING. BUT THERE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN OPTION TO EXTEND THE MEMORY.
      
      4) BATTERY - WITH MEDIUM TO HEAVY USAGE.. BATTERY WILL HARDLY LAST A DAY.
      
      
      ALL IN A ALL, ITS ONE HECK A PHONE.. A REAL BEAUTY FROM MICROMAX AND PROBABLY THE BEST PHONE IN THE 20K RANGE. GO FOR IT."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"GOT THIS PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER, SHE'S VERY HAPPY. THE BLOW TO UNLOCK IS TRICKY, EVERY OTHER FEATURE I TRIED WORKED WELL."

      CAMERA IS GOOD AND SMART.
      
      BATTERY IS NOT VERY GOOD BUT OK."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"GREAT PRODUCT, VALUE FOR MONEY WITH ITS SPECIFIED FEATURES...
      
      
      BUT ON USING HEAVY DUTY GAMING APPS PHONE HEATS UP, MOST PROBABLY DUE TO THE CHEAPER PROCESSOR MEDIATEK
      
      EG. FIFA 14,ASPHALT ETC."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"HANDSET IS EASY TO USE, HOWEVER GETTING INTO HANG MODE VERY FERQUENTLY.

      COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DEAL IF FLIP COVER INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"HAVE GOT THIS PHONE RECENTLY AND IS FAIRLY BUNDLED PACKAGE THAT CAN BE TERMED AS VFM.
      
      OVER ALL PHONE PERFORMANCE IS MUCH BETTER THAN NORMAL SSUNG PHONES (I USED GALAXY SPLUS , GRAND AND SSUNG NOTE2). FOR TECHNOLOGY USERS WITH LIMITED SPACE AND GOOD SPEED, THIS IS THE PHONE IN LOW BUDGET. THOUGH IT MIGHT DISAPPOINT HIGH AND BRIGHT RESOLUTION HD LOVERS.
      
      
      HAD GOT ISSUE WITH DEVICE NOT BEING CHARGED WHEN ON (IT WAS CHARGED ONLY AFTER SWITCHED OFF), BUT FLIPCART HELPED WITH REPLACEMENT.
      
      
      PRONS:
      
      1.) GREAT FEATURES LIKE BLOW AIR AND SHAKE TO UNLOCK, NOTES WHILE CALL IS IN PROGRESS, POPUP BROWSER FOR QUICK SEARCH WHILE ANOTHER OPERATION IN PROGRESS AND BEST OF ALL, PIN TO START KEY OPERATIONS LIKE CALL/SMS/WEB BROWSING ETC WHILE RUNNING AN APP - INCLUDING GAMES.
      
      2.) EXCELLENT SUPPORT ON OFFICE APPLICATIONS LIKE WORD/EXCEL/POWERPOINT
      
      3.) GOOD CAMERA FRONT AND REAR - FLASH IS ALSO DECENT FOR LOW LIGHT CAPTURE
      
      4.) GOOD HD SUPPORT FOR VIDEOS - SPEED IS NOT CONSTRAIN
      
      5.) DECENT BATTERY LIFE - HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY UP AVERAGE 14/15 HRS FOR 4 DAYS. HEAVY USAGE ON BROWSING - WATSUP AND AVG 3 HOURS OF WIFI CONNECTION USAGE.
      
      6.) OVER ALL PHONE PERFORMANCE IS MUCH BETTER THAN NORMAL SSUNG PHONES [I USED GALAXY SPLUS AND SSUNG NOTE2]
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1.) BRIGHNESS IS LITTLE DISAPPOINTING AS COMPARED TO SSUNG GRAND / NOTE2
      
      2.) EXPANDABLE MEMORY IS NOT AN OPTION FOR GARBAGE COLLECTOR USERS.. YOU HAVE TO KEEP CLEANING UP
      
      3.) MUSIC AND AUDIO PLAYBACK IS NOT AT PAR IF COMPARED WITH SSUNG GRAND / SONY XPERIA
      
      
      YET TO CHECK PHONE AND VIDEO CONFERENCING, PDF SUPPORT, 3D GAMES"

SECURITY AND NOW I AM GETTING DECENT BACKUP (1ND A HALF DAYS).GOOD CAM AT THIS PRICE AND BOUGT KLD COVER FROM FLIP.(899).IT SUPPORT MOST CASUL GAME(SUBWAY,TEMPLE RUN ETC) ND REAL RACE 3 BUT ASPHAT 8 IS JUST LAGING.OTHER THAN THAT ITS BETTER CHOICE NOW.IF YOU ARE A HEAVY GAMER GO FOR S3(22K),S4(28K)OR GRAND 2(20K).IF LOKING FOR LOW BUDGET HEAVY SMART PHONE GO FOR CANVAS TURBO.AT 14 K YOU WILL GET A BEAST.(REMEMBER NOT GOOD AT HEAVY GAMING)"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"HI , I BOUGHT TURBO ON JAN 11TH THROUGH FLIPKART.
      
      I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE DELIVERY TIME AND WITH THE QUALITY THEY PROVIDED.
      
      ITS HAVING AMAZING FEATURES AND DISPLAY CLARITY, PROCEESING SPEED.
      
      
      AS OF NOW I AM FEELING ONLY ONE DRAW BACK.
      
      THAT IS BATTERY BACKUP. IT WILL STAND UP TO MAX OF 5 HOURS ONLY AND WILL REDUCE BASED ON YOUR
      
      USAGE. OTHER THAN THIS AM VERY HAPPY TO OWN A MICROMAX TURBO :) :)"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I AM USER OF ALL MICROMAX PHONES ESPECIALLY CANVAS SERIES
      
      
      AS MANY PEOPLE ALREADY REVIEWED THIS PRODUCT I WILL TALK ONLY ABOUT CONS
      
      
      PROS:
      
      LIGHTER SLEEK PHONE BUT FLIP COVER IS NOT AVAILABLE AS FIXED BACK COVER
      
      BACK CAMERA FLASH IS GOOD FOR CLOSEUPS
      
      I HAVE MORE MONEY TO BUY AND I THOUGHT THERE IS VALUE IN THIS PRODUCT SO I PAID  THE PRICE DISCARDING MY CANVAS 2PLUS WHICH IS ABOUT 10K AND IS BETTER BELIVE ME
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      IF YOUR PHONE HANGS YOU HAVE NO BATTERY TO REMOVE, TO RESTART IS A PAIN
      
      BATTERY IS 30-35% LESS FROM CANVAS 2 PLUS ON SAME USAGE (ABOUT 6-7HRS)
      
      HAS 2GB RAM BUT APP INSTALL STORAGE IS 1GB ONLY SO YOU ARE FORCED TO USE RAM FROM YOUR 16GB DISK AND YOU CANT UPGRADE
      
      QUADCORE PROCESSOR BUT  TOUCH IS NOT AS GOOD AS IN CANVAS 2 DUAL CORE
      
      WITHOUT FLIP COVER CHANCES WILL GET BREAK EASY IF SLIPS OUT OF YOUR HAND
      
      CAMERA IS MORE PIXS BUT DOES NOT FEEL THAT WHEN YOU SEE PICS
      
      EXCEPT NIGHT PICS WITH FLASH ARE GOOD IN THIS TURBO WHERE CANVAS 2 HAS LED FLASH AND POOR NIGHT IMAGES
      
      
      SUMMARY:
      
      HD RECORDING AND DISPLAY IS NO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS
      
      IN USAGE IS MORE LIKE CANVAS 2PLUS NO GREAT ADVANTAGE
      
      BACK FLASH ADITION IS GOOD
      
      I AM MICROMAX FAN BUT WILL STICK WITH CANVAS 2PLUS AS ONLY THING I LIKE IN THIS PHONE IS SLEEK DESIGN AND LIGHT WEIGHT :-) IS IT WORTH THE PRICE ADDITION OF ABOUT 6-7K EXTRA  YOU PAY"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I AM USING IT FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS. IT IS DOING WELL, BUT BATTERY LIFE IS SHORT. IT SHOULD BE 3000MAH. FLIPKART SERVICE IS VERY GOOD."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN NOV 2013 @ 19K.
      
      THE OOK N FEEL IS AWSOME...
      
      THE PHONE LOOKS GR8 WITHOUT SILICON COVER ON IT...
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. LOOKS REALLY COOL N SMART.
      
      2. MOTION SENSORS R AWESOME
      
      3.SPEED IS GOOD.
      
      4.HD SCREEN IS GREAT.
      
      5. AFFORDABLE
      
      6. ETC
      
      
      CONS:
      
      IF THE PHONES GETS HANGED FOR SOME REASON U HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL WHOLE BATTERY DRAINS OUT. AND THEN CHARGE AGAIN TO RECHARGE. COZ OF UNREMOVABLE BATTERY.
      
      (NT A BIG DEAL COZ IT RARELY HAPPENS- DEPENDS ON USERS )"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I BROUGHT THE MOBILE IN 17000 INR AND AND IN PRICE ITS AN EXCELLENT PHONE, DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD, DESIGN IS VERY GOOD LOOKS AND FEEL TOO GOOD IN HAND. PERFORMANCE IS ALSO VERY GOD. RIGHT NOW I HAVE TATA DOCOMO CONNECTION SO I CANT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE 3G SPEED TO SURF BUT ON WIFY ITS VERY FAST IN OPENING THE WEBPAGES AND ALSO IN DOWNLOADING. THE ONLY ISSUE IS THE BATTERY OTHERWISE I WILL GAVE 5 STAR
      
      
      I REALLY LIKED THE PHONE"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I GOT THE DELIVERY OF THIS PHONE ON 18TH DEC. I STARTED USING IT. I DID NOT FACE THE PROBLEM OF HANG ETC TILL NOW. DISPLAY IS GOOD. TOUCH RESPONSE IS GOOD. BATTERY SEEMS TO BE OKAY AS IT LASTED FOR MORE THAN A DAY.
      
      
      I DID NOT LIKE BELOW THINGS.
      
      
      1. BUNDLED APPLICATIONS (WHICH EATS AWAY MY 0.98GM APP SPACE). USER SHOULD GET AN OPTION TO REMOVE.
      
      2. LIGHT IN WEIGHT COMPARED TO CANVAS 4.
      
      3. SLIGHTLY HIGHER BATTERY
      
      4. NO MEMORY CARD SLOT.
      
      
      OVER ALL ITS A GOOD PHONE WORTH FOR 17K."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FROM ALMOST PAST 13 DAYS NOW. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS IS VERY GOOD. I AM USING THIS PHONE EXTENSIBLE FROM PAST 15 DAYS FOR TESTING PURPOSE AND SO FAR DID NOT FIND ANYTHING CONFLICTING. HERE ARE THE PROS AND CON'S OF THIS PHONE:
      
      PRO'S:
      
      1. THE PHONE IS SUPERBLY FASTER. I AM USING IPAD-4, I TRIED SEVERAL GAME ON BOTH THE DEVICES AND DID NOT FIND ANYTHING TO COMPLAINT ABOUT THE PROCESSOR SPEED OF THE PHONE.
      
      
      2. I AM NOT SURE WHY FEW OF THE PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE BATTERY OF THIS PHONE BUT BATTERY OF THIS PHONE FOR ME TURNED OUT TO BE GREAT. I AM CHARGING MY PHONE AFTER 24 HOURS WHILE MY PHONE IS IN CONTINUOUS USE(PLAYING GAMES, CHECKING MAILS, DATA SERVICES ARE ON ETC)
      
      
      3. PHONE IS SLEEK AND CONSIDERABLY LIGHT WEIGHT.
      
      
      4. THE GRIP OF THE PHONE IS ALSO GOOD AND PHONE SEEMS TO BE DURABLE TO ME..
      
      
      5. I LOVE THE DEFAULT IFLOAT APPLICATION AND DO THE MULTIPLE THING AT A TIME.
      
      
      6. THERE MANY PROXIMITY SENSOR IN THIS PHONE. E.G. PHONE CAN GO TO SILENT MODE IF YOU TURNED THE PHONE IF ITS RING, YOU CAN JUST TURNED THE PHONE BACK TO SWITCH ON THE SPEAKER AUTOMATICALLY WHILE YOU'RE ON THE CALL...ETC.
      
      
      7. FACE IDENTIFICATION LOOK IS ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE.
      
      
      CON'S:
      
      
      1. CAMERA OF THIS PHONE IS NOT UP TO THE MARK. YOU CAN COMPROMISE ON THIS AS PHONE COST IS VERY LOW CONSIDERING THE OTHER EXCELLENT THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE.
      
      
      2. PHONE HEATS UP IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE FOR SEVERAL HOURS. IF YOU BUY THE FLIP COVER THEN YOU WILL NOT FEEL THE HEAT.
      
      
      3. PHONE DO NOT HAVE KITKAT.
      
      
      OVERALL CONSIDERING THE PRICE AND THE HARDWARE/FEATURE, THE PHONE IS SUPERB AND WORTH BUYING THIS PHONE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I HAVE ORDERED TOTAL 3 MOBILES OF MICROMAX OUT OF WHICH
      
      ONE MICROMAX CANVAS  2 PLUS A250, WORKING GOOD, NICE MOBILE SO HAPPY WITH WHAT I HAVE SELECTED.
      
      SOME TIMES IT HANGS, BUT OVERALL IN THIS COST ITS GOOD OR U CAN SAY BETTER.
      
      
      ONE THING I WANNA SAY, MACHINES ARE MADE TO HELP US NOT TO WASTE OUR TIME, IF YOU PLAY GAMES IN MOBILES, SURE ANY MOBILE WILL HANG. JUST DONT WASTE TIME IN PLAYING GAMES AND WASTE THING, USE THE TECHNOLOGY IN GAINING KNOWLEDGE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,I LUV D PHONE ITS BEEN TWO WEEKS NO MAJOR DISTRACTIONS. EVEN I FOUND THE PROCESSOR IS DOING A GOOD JOB SINCE I AM NOT INTO BIG GAMES. AND I SIMPLY LUV THE DESIGN AND ITS TOO HANDY..I AM LOOKING FORWARD FOR AN OFFICIAL KITKAT UPGRADE. I THINK THE MICROMAX PHONESWILL MAKE SOMETHING BIG IN D FUTURE!
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I PLACED ORDER FOR THIS PHONE ON 30TH DEC13 IN FLIPKART AND IT WAS DELIVERED TO ME ON 2ND JAN.  HAVING USED THIS PHONE FOR 2 MONTHS, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME PROS AND CONS WITH THIS MICROMAX FLAGSHIP PHONE.
      
      
      FIRST ABOUT PROS
      
      1... HATS OFF TO FLIPKART FOR SPEEDY DELIVERY.
      
      
      2..FABULOUS LOOK AND SLIM DESIGN.
      
      
      3...STUNNING HD SCREEN, PICTURES AND HD VIDEOS ARE ABSOLUTELY MESMERISING.
      
      
      4...BOTH SIM CARD SLOTS SUPPORT 3G AGAINST MOST OF THE OTHERS DUEL SIM SMARTPHONES  WHERE ONLY ONE SLOT SUPPORT 3G.
      
      
      5...GOOD CHARGER AND EARPHONE. FLAT CORD DOES NOT GET ENTANGLED.
      
      
      6....2GB RAM ENSURES ALL PROGRAMMES AND GAMES RUN WITHOUT ANY LAG AND DELAY.
      
      
      7...TOUCH IS VERY GOOD.
      
      
      NOW CONS..
      
      1..EVEN FOR MODERATE USE BATTERY WOULD NOT LAST BEYOND 24 HRS.
      
      
      2..NON REMOVABLE BATTERY. BUT THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE AS EVEN IF PHONE GETS HANGED, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR BATTERY TO GET DRAINED AS REPORTED IN EARLIER REVIEWS. PHONE CAN BE RESTARTED BY PRESSING POWER AND VOLUME BUTTON SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR 10 SECONDS. MY PHONE GOT HANGED TWICE IN 2 MONTHS.
      
      
      3..NON EXPANDABLE MEMORY, BUT HERE AGAIN OUT OF 16 GB INTERNAL YOU GET 12.46 GB OF USABLE MEMORY WHICH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR NORMAL USE.
      
      
      4... 13 MP BACK CAMERA IS NOT MUCH TO WRITE HOME ABOUT. PHOTO TAKEN WITH FLASH HAS SOMETIME TOO MUCH OF LIGHT.
      
      
      5.. 5 MP FRONT CAMERA IS O.K
      
      
      6..CHARGING FROM 99% TO 100 % TAKES 30 MINUTES
      
      
      7..SPEAKER AT THE BACK MUFFLES THE SOUND IF PHONE IS FLAT ON THE SURFACE.
      
      
      8...ALL THE SMART GESTURES FEATURES FLAUNTED WITH THE PHONE ARE WORTHLESS.
      
      
      ONE THING MORE, I DID GET THE OFFER OF 10% CASHBACK BY THE DEADLINE DATE OF 5TH MARCH AS PROMISED BY FLIPKART AT THE TIME OF PURCHASING THIS PHONE WITH HDFC CREDIT CARD.
      
      
      OVERALL THIS IS A GOOD PROPOSITION CONSIDERING ITS PRICE AND FEATURES, BUT SOMETINES BATTERY DOES LET YOU DOWN ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A HEAVY GAMER..."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I THINK, THE CONFIGURATION OF THIS PHONE IS VERY-VERY GOOD BUT THE DRAWBACK IS ONLY TWO:-
      
      
      1. BATTERY IS ONLY 2000MH
      
      
      2. NOT SD-CARD SLOT.
      
      
      ALL OVER GOOD PHONE WITHIN 20,000/-."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"I'M USING CANVAS TURBO FROM THE LAST 1 MONTH, I PURCHASED IT FROM FLIPCART ON 31ST OF DECEMBER, BUT THE DEVICE I GOT WAS HAVING DISPLAY PROBLEM, BUT THANKS TO FLIPCART THEY REPLACED IT WITHIN 3 DAYS, AMAZING SERVICE.
      
      
      ABOUT THE DEVICE, I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED BY IT'S LOOK, EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT TS LOOK IN MY OFFICE, EVEN IN THIS SEGMENT NO ONE OFFERS PREMIUM BUILT QUALITY, GOOD PERFORMANCE, HD SCREEN &AMP; LOTS OF, FOR HIGH HD GAMES IT MAY LAG IN PERFORMANCE, BUT I THINK THIS IS GOOD OPTION FOR THIS PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      IT WAS HANGED 1 DAY, HEATS UP IF YOU PLAY LOTS OF APPLICATIONS AT A TIME, NOT AN MAJOR ISSUE, EVEN MY FRIENDS I-PHONE 4S HANGS AND HEATS UP.
      
      
      GUYS, BRAND NOTHING MAKES DIFFERENCE, IT'S PEOPLES F....... MENTALITY, IF U R GETTING BEST THEN WHY NOT TO GO FOR IT???
      
      
      THUMBS UP FROM ME!!!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,IN COMPARING WITH SAMSUNG ITS A GOOD ONE.BATTERY BACKUP IS ALSO GOOD.BACKUPIS ALMOST 1.5 DAYS. PROCESSOR IS ALSO GOOD 1.5 GHZ QD CORE PROCESSOR
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"IT WAS A NICE PURCHASE FROM FLIPKART , PROPER DELIVERY AND PRODUCT. NICE SPECIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE WITH INTERNAL MEMORY BUT NOW I AM FEELING THAT THERE MUST A CARD SLOT FOR EXTRA MEMEORY CARDS. WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE. IF MICROMAX CAN NOW PROVIDE EXTRA SLOT WITH SOME CHARGES THAT WLLL BE FINE AT THEIR SERVICE CENTER"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,ITS AMAZING..TO FAST AND SUPER SMOOTH TOUCH AND THE 2 GB RAM SOME WHERE NEAR 15K..WORTH EVERY PENNY...:)
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"ITS BEEN 10 DAYS I PURCHASED MMX TURBO FROM FLIPKART. DELIVERY TOOK 7 DAYS (IT IS NOT EXPECTED FROM FLIPKART). ITS SO STYLISH,SLEEK AND LIGHT WEIGHT. IT WORKS LIKE A BREEZE. ONLY PROBLEM I'VE FACED IS BATTERY  GETS LITTLE HEATED UP ONLY AFTER A HEAVY GAME PLAY OTHERWISE NOT MUCH PROBLEM I'VE FACED.
      
      
      PHONE EASILY RUNS FOR A DAY FOR NORMAL USE (2 HRS OF 3G BROWSING, 1 HR OF GAMING, 1 HR OF TALKING ..ETC)
      
      
      MMZ COULD HAVE INCREASED BATTERY FROM 2000 MAH TO AT LEAST 2300 MAH, NOWADAYS EVERY HIGH END MOBILE IS COMING WITH GOOD BATTERY, STILL I'LL SAY THAT THIS PHONE RUNS FOR A DAY VERY EASILY.
      
      
      DEFAULT/BUILT APP'S PROVIDED WITH THIS PHONE NEEDS MORE TESTING BEEN DONE.
      
      
      ONE THING FOR SURE NO ONE SHOULD COMPARE TURBO WITH HTC ONE OR SONY Z1/SONY Z ULTRA. AT THIS PRICE RANGE COMPARING TURBO WITH THESE HIGH END PHONES MAY NOT MAKE SENSE BUT DEFINITELY IT COMPETES WITH THEM IN ALL ASPECTS."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,ITS WORTH! VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT! IF YOU ARE GETTING THIS PRODUCT AT DISCOUNTED RATE NOTHING BETTER THAN THAT... ONLY ONE ISSUE.. MAIN CAMERA IS NOT THAT GOOD AT NIGHT/IN THE DARK..
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"LOOKING FOR A QUAD CORE, DUAL SIM, FULL HD 5"" DISPLAY PHONE WITHIN 20K, THEN THIS IS IT !!
      
      
      AM RATING THIS 5/5 AS I CONSIDER THE PRICE FOR THIS PHONE WITH THE SPECS PROVIDED AND NOT COMPARING THIS WITH HIGH END PHONES AVAILABLE AT 30K OR MORE. ALSO I GOT A 10% CASH BACK SO 18K FOR THIS PHONE IS A STEAL."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"LOVE THIS PHONE. AMAZING DISPLAY, LIGHT WEIGHT, AND CAMERA IS FANTASTIC. ONLY ONE DRAWBACK IS, IT IS NOT UPGRADABLE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"MICROMAX HAS BEEN IN THE FORAY FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS GIVING TOUGH COMPETITION TO THE LIKES OF SONY, SAMSUNG. EARLIER I HAVE USED SAMSUNG S DUOS, AND CANVAS HD.
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN SUGGESTING SAMSUNG TILL 6 MONTHS BACK, BUT NOW I CHANGE MY MIND TO MMX. IT IS NICE TO SEE AN INDIAN COMPANY SLOWLY SCALING UP.
      
      
      FEW THINGS I HAVE OBSERVER IN THE PAST 15 DAYS OF USAGE.
      
      - BATTERY BACK HAS BEEN DECENT, IF YOU ARE GAMING FREAK IT WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT
      
      - DISPLAY QUALITY IS SUPERB
      
      - IMPROVED EARPHONES COMPARED TO CANVAS HD
      
      - THE BUILD QUALITY AND LOOKS ARE GOOD
      
      
      ON THE CONS SIDE
      
      - THEY COULD HAVE INCREASED BATTERY CAPACITY, SINCE THIS PHONE FEATURES HIGHER CONFIGURATION
      
      - THEY COULD HAVE INCLUDED THE EXTERNAL MEMORY SLOT, WHICH PARALYSES PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO WOULD LIKE TO CARRY LOT OF SONGS AND MOVIES ON THE GO."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"NICE PHONE WITH RICH FEATURES. PHONE FINISHING NEEDS SOME IMPROVEMENTS OTHERWISE IT'S WORTH FOR RS 17,000."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"NICE PHONE, BETTER THAN SAMSUNG/HTC PHONES IN SAME PRICE.
      
      
      CAMERA NOT VERY GOOD, MAY BE I M NOT USING IT PROPERLY.
      
      VERY HANDY PHONE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"PHONE IS EASY TO HANDLE, LIGHT WEIGHT AND VERY FRIENDLY. SPEED IS GOOD. BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO GOOD.
      
      MAJOR PROBLEM IS CAMERA CLARITY. ITS DEFINIETLY NOT 13MP.
      
      SO IF YOU LOOKING FOR A GREAT CAMERA WITH PHONE, DONT.
      
      ELSE A SMART PHONE WHICH IS VER SMART - GOOD CHOICE"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"PRO
      
      GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY PACK. GOT AMAZING OFFER ON FLIPKART, (15% DISCOUNT FROM SELLER AND ADDITIONAL 10% CASHBACK ON CREDIT CARD) EFFECTIVELY 25% DISCOUND FROM CURRENT MARKET PRICE !
      
      
      TIMELY DELIVERY BY FLIPKART !
      
      
      FHD SCREEN IS HIGHLIGHT OF THIS PRODUCT.
      
      
      CAMERA PERFORMANCE IS OK, BUT LOVED SOME OF THE FEATURES (360   NORMAL PANORAMA, HD RECORDING   OBJECT ERASER )
      
      
      1.5 GHZ PROCESSOR IS GOOD ENOUGH,
      
      
      CONS :
      
      
      BATTERY IS EXHAUSTED VERY QUICKLY, YOU HAVE TO CARRY CHARGER (GENERALLY LESS THAN 8 HOURS)
      
      
      I HAVE NOTICED HEATING IN FIRST FEW DAYS ( HAVE TO VERIFY EFFECT OF BACK COVER IN THIS CASE)
      
      
      APPLICATION STORAGE MEMORY 0.98 GB IS CONCERN IF YOU USE FB   CHROME ALONE 100 MB WILL BE CONSUMED AND MOST OF THE GOOGLE APPLICATION ( G , MAPS,   LOCAL, ETC) WILL NOT BE MOVABLE TO SD CARD.
      
      
      OVER AND ABOVE"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"PROS -&GT;
      
      * GREAT FEATURES
      
      * GOOD CAMERA QUALITY
      
      * GOOD GAMING EXPERIENCE
      
      
      CONS -&GT;
      
      * BATTERY BACKUP NOT UPTO MARK
      
      * SHORT DATA CABLE/CHARGING CHORD"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"PROS: 1. WIDE &AMP; BRIGHT SCREEN
      
      2. COMPARATIVELY SLIM MOBILE
      
      3. GOOD VIDEO PLAY BACK (ON MX PLAYER)
      
      4. BATTERY BACK-UP IS GOOD (IF YOU ARE GAMER THEN FORGET IT, GO FOR SONY PLAY STATION - MOBILE PHONES ARE USED FOR SIMPLE PROCESSING THINGS, WELL THAT AGAIN DEPENDS ON HOW MATURE YOU ARE IN TERMS OF USING THE MOBILE AS GAMING PRODUCT OR USING IT AS ACTUAL MOBILE) - STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT BACK UP, INSTALL 2X BATTERY. WITH THIS BUDGET NO OTHER MOBILE GIVES YOU SUCH GREAT SPECS.
      
      5. ANY BLUETOOTH HEADSET CAN BE USED - WORKS SMOOTH.
      
      6. 3G CONNECTIVITY IS AWESOME, I GET 4.8MBPS CONSTANTLY ON AIRTEL (SOMETIMES GOES UPTO 6MBPS)....LETS CONSIDER THE WORST NETWORK (DOCOMO)...I GET 2.6MBPS, AIRCEL = 3.5MBPS
      
      7. CAMERA IS GOOD (YOU CAN EXPECT 8MP CLARITY FROM A 13MP)  = FOR A MOBILE PHONE ITS DAMN GOOD (FRONT CAMERA WORKS AWESOME WITH SKYPE)
      
      
      CONS: THIS IS NOT EXACTLY A BAD ONE BUT JUST A REVIEW THAT HAS TO BE ON ""CONS"" SIDE
      
      1. I HAVE TAKEN 168 PHOTOS CONTINUOUSLY WITH 13MP - THEN ONLY BATTERY STARTED HEATING UP (OTHERWISE FOR A MOBILE PHONE, THIS IS AWESOME - YOU CAN'T COMPARE IT WITH A CANNON, NIKKON OR SONY CAMERA ::: COM'ON GUYS ITS MOBILE THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS IT SHOULD PROCESS WHILE YOU ARE TAKING SNAPS)
      
      2. NO OPTION TO CHOOSE CUSTOM RINGTONES OR NOIFICATIONS (THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY TO FIGURE THAT OUT)
      
      3. NO EXTERNAL MEMORY
      
      4. IN-BUILT BATTERY"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"QUITE HAPPY WITH THE DECISION TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.
      
      
      GREAT PHONE IN UNBEATABLE PRICE.
      
      
      PLAYING GAMES IS ALSO GOOD BUT ONLY ONE FLIP SIDE THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN AN EXPANDABLE MEMORY."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"SISTERURBO IS A CAPABLE PHONE. I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAD, AND I'VE ONLY USED IT FOR A SHORT TIME NOW, BUT I'LL UPDATE THIS INFO IF I ENCOUNTER ANYTHING INTERESTING LATER ON. HAVING A 1.5GHZ PROCESSOR, ONE WOULD EXPECT SMOOTH OPERATION FROM IT, BUT I THINK THE FULL HD DISPLAY BOGS IT DOWN. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE PHONE PERFORMS FAST ENOUGH - ONLY THAT ANIMATIONS ARE A BIT CHOPPY (ESPECIALLY QUICK SETTINGS PULL DOWN) AND HIGH END GAMES WILL LAG. MAYBE I'M FEELING SO BECAUSE I'M USED TO MY NEXUS 4 SMOOTHNESS. INDEED, POWERING 1920*1080 PIXELS IS NO MEAN FEAT.
      
      HERE ARE A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR WHICH I'D RECOMMEND THIS PHONE:
      
      1) 2 GB OF RAM. MAIN REASON WHY I CHOSE THIS INSTEAD OF CANVAS MAGNUS. SO CAN EASILY HANDLE LARGE CONTACT BOOK WITH THOUSANDS OF CONTACTS, ALONG WITH HEAVY OFFICE APPLICATIONS ETC.
      
      2) LARGE AND CRISP DISPLAY. THOUGH I BELIEVE THE DISPLAY BOGS THE PERFORMANCE DOWN A BIT, IT IS INDEED A BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY. THE COLOURS DO NOT POP OUT LIKE IN AMOLED DISPLAYS, BUT LOOKS DECENT ENOUGH. I COMPARED IT SIDE BY SIDE WITH A CANVAS HD AND CAM SAY THAT IT'S SHARPER AND CRISPER, WITH WARMER COLOUR REPRODUCTION.
      
      3) THE PHONE LOOKS DECENT. ALUMINUM FINISH IS A NICE TOUCH.
      
      4) OF COURSE, DUAL SIM IS A PRIMARY CONCERN FOR MY DAD.
      
      
      WHY I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE:
      
      1) CAMERA: EVEN WITH A 13MP SENSOR, IT DOES NOT TAKE GOOD PICTURES. COMPARED WITH MY NEXUS 4 IN INDOOR PHOTOS AND THE TURBO'S PICTURES ARE SOFTER, WITH LESSER OVERALL DETAILS, AND AVERAGE COLOUR REPRODUCTION.
      
      2) NO SD CARD SLOT: STUCK WITH THE 12.5 GB USABLE INTERNAL SD CARD.
      
      
      SO IN GENERAL, IT'S A GOOD BUY IF IT FITS YOUR NEEDS. GOING TO DEVELOPER OPTIONS AND SWITCHING OFF ANIMATIONS DO HELP."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"SO, I THOUGHT I WOULD WRITE THE REVIEW AFTER USING IT FOR A WHILE, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A 5 STAR BUT I LIMITED MYSELF TO 4 BECAUSE I FELT ONE THING IS MISSING IN THE PHONE AND THAT IS ITS APP STORAGE. OUT OF 16GB ONLY 1 GB IS RESERVED FOR APP STORAGE WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LOT OF BIG GAMES. OTHERWISE THIS DEVICE IS A ++.
      
      
      PROS :
      
      1 - VERY NICE BUILD. AN STYLISH PHONE FOR NON IPHONE FREAK PPL.
      
      2 - GOOD SCREEN HOWEVER GORILLA GLASS IS MISSING.
      
      3 - BOTH FRONT AND REAR CAMERA ARE GOOD.
      
      4 - VERY RESPONSIVE,
      
      5 - I LOVE ITS MULTITASKING FEATURE. THE IFLOAT APPS
      
      6 - AWESOME BATTERY BACKUP, UNDER NORMAL USAGE RUNS FOR 16-18 HOURS :)
      
      7 -  HEADPHONES ARE VERY GOOD.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      1 - ONLY 1 GB APP MEMORY.
      
      2 - GETS A LONG TIME TO GET 100% CHARGED AFTER 99%.
      
      
      AS A BUYER I WILL SUGGEST TO GO FOR THIS PHONE IF YOU WANT A POWER PACKED PHONE FOR LOW PRICE.. YES I GOT 10% CASH BACK :D.."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"STYLISH! CAMERA QUALITY AWESOME! BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD - LASTS FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS WITH EXTENSIVE USE OF VOICE CALLS. IN-BUILT APPLICATION I-FLOAT MAKES IT EASY TO MULTITASK.
      
      VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY - FEATURE-WISE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"SUCH AN AMAZING PHONE. ONLY ONE THING BOTHERED ME WAS WHEN I OPENED THE BOX , I FOUND MADE IN CHINA TAG INSTEAD OF MADE IN INDIA.
      
      
      OTHERWISE PHONE IS AMAZING AND BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO COOL."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"THE CAMERA HAS ISSUES UNDER LOW LIGHT AND IN ZOOM THE PICTURE QUALITY IS VERY POOR.
      
      EXCEPT CAMERA OTHER HARDWARE IS GOOD."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"THE DEVICE IS GOOD - WHAT I WANTED IN A GIVEN BUDGET
      
      
      MY USAGE IS LARGELY BUSINESS AND PERSONAL. MY USAGE SUMMARY IS - TWITTER, LINKEDIN, POCKET, TED TALKS, GOOGLE DRIVE, OFFICE RELATED APPS... NOT ONE WHO WOULD NEED AN QUAD CORE. I NEEDED A 2GB RAM BECAUSE OF HEAVY TWITTER, POCKET, TED TALK  USAGE WHICH RESULTS IN LOT OF MEMORY CONSUMPTION.
      
      
      THIS DEVICE WORKS FINE, HOWEVER I TWEAKED SOMETHING, ACTUALLY MANY, (NOW NOT GOING BACK TO CHECK WHAT WENT WRONG), SO SOMETHING HAPPENED -
      
      CAMERA STOPS WORKING SOME TIMES, SO I JUST RESTART IT. MY ASSUMPTION IS I INSTALLED SOME APP AND TWEAKED STUFF.
      
      
      YES, I CAN GO TO THE SERVICE CENTER, YET NOT GONE THERE STILL. MAY BE CAMERA WAS NOT THAT NECESSARY FOR ME AS MUCH AS A 2GB RAM WAS.
      
      
      I HAVE 47 APPS RIGHT NOW, ALSO HAD INSTALLED ABOUT 10-15 MORE APPS WHICH I REMOVED
      
      
      I AM NOT A GAMING FREAK."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"THE PHONE IS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT. FINISH IS EXCELLENT. TOUCH FUNCTIONS FEATHER TOUCH. APPS MOVE SMOOTHLY. NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER WITH NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY. THERE IS ENOUGH TO BE STORED. THOUGH WOULD ADVISE TO KEEP A CHECK ON WHAT IS BEING DOWNLOADED. ONLY PROBLEM FACED IS THE PHONE GETS REALLY WARM CERTAIN APPS ARE USED SUCH AS SKYPE OR GPS/ NAVIGATION. HOWEVER, CANNOT CONFIRM WHETHER THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH MY PHONE OR WITH TURBO IN GENERAL. ELSE THE PHONE SEEMS TO BE WORKING LIKE A DREAM."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,THE PHONE IS VERY NICE. BEAUTIFUL CAMERA AND PICTURE QUALITY. HOWEVER IM A BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH ITS SOUND QUALITY. IT IS VERY LOW IN COMPARISON WITH THE OTHER PHONES IN THIS CATEGORY.
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"THIS DEVICE DOES ALL THAT IS PROMISED IN THE FEATURES LIST. GOOD PHONE TO OWN AT A GOOD PRICE POINT
      
      
      WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:
      
      
      1. CAMERA IS AVERAGE UNDER LOW LIGHT
      
      2. BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS NOT GREAT WITH WIFI OR 3G ENABLES"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"THIS MOBILE IS REALLY GOOD
      
      ONLY CONCERN IS TH BATTERY.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE, CAMERA QUALITY IS SPLENDID
      
      
      WRTH TO BUY FOR TH RATE ITS BEING S SOLD :)"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,THIS MOBILE IS WORTH IT FOR THE MONEY YOU SPENT.  EXCEPT THE CAMERA QUALITY ( 13 MP) EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOOD. CAMERA IS NOT TOO BAD..BUT COULD BE BETTER WITH THE SPECIFICATION IT HAS. BUT AGAIN.. WITH THIS PRICING ...ITI IS OK.
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"THIS MY 4TH SMART PHONE, LATEST WAS HTC ONE X AND I AM IMPRESSED WITH ITS RESPONSIVE SCREEN, PROCESSOR SPEED, CAMERA (SPECIALLY FRONT CAM IS WOW), TOUCH FESTIVITY AND SCREEN RESOLUTION. ONLY ISSUE IS THAT SOME TIME IT FREEZES WHILE MULTITASKING.
      
      
      IT IS THE BEST PHONE AT THIS PRICE AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT IF YOUR BUDGET IS BELOW 20K.
      
      
      PS - LETS SUPPORT INDIAN ECONOMY BUY BUYING INDIAN MAKES COS ITS NEEDED!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"TO START WITH, WOULD LOVE TO TELL ABOUT EXCELLENT QUALITY AND DELIVERY EFFICIENCY BY FLIPKART
      
      HANDSET WAS PACKED WELL IN A THICK BUBBLE WRAP AND KEPT IN A NICE BOX
      
      HAVE ALWAYS GOT THE BEST FROM FLIPKART AND WILL KEEP GETTING !
      
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PHONE :
      
      LOVE THE DESIGN ! THE TOUCHSCREEN IS LIKE NOTHING I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED !!
      
      ALL THE SPECS ARE TRUE AND UP TO THE MARK
      
      HAS EXCELLENT ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND GREAT PICTURE QUALITY FOR VIEWING VIDEOS
      
      12.5 GB INTERNAL MEMORY (AWESOME) AND 1 GB PHONE MEMORY
      
      EXCELLENT NOISE REDUCTION AND DECENT BATTERY LIFE. WORKS FROM 100% IN THE MORNING 8AM TO 14 - 15% BATTERY LIFE REMAINING IN THE EVENING 8PM WITH 3G TURNED ON AND LISTENING TO MUSIC TOO.
      
      GAMING QUALITY SUPERB !!
      
      
      SOME STUFF  (THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY DISAPPOINTING) BUT ARE DOWN:
      
      THE CAMERA SOMETIMES KEEPS FOCUSING AND ITS CONFUSING WHEN TO CLICK A PROPER PIC.
      
      MUSIC OUTPUT FROM BOTH SPEAKER AND EARPHONES/AUDIOJACK IS SUFFICENTLY CLEAR BUT NOT LOUD ENOUGH FOR BASS AND POWERFULL MUSIC LOVERS.
      
      ANDROID VERSION IS 4.2.1 (4.2.2 LATEST JELLY BEAN)
      
      NO EXTERNAL SD SUPPORT, BOTH SLOTS FOR SIM IS MICROSIM , BATTERY IS NOT REMOVABLE,
      
      THE PHONE HANGS SOMETIMES BUT HAS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO RESTART, JUST PRESS THE POWER BUTTON FOR 15 - 20 SECS AND IT WILL BE BACK TO NORMAL"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"TOTAL VALUE FOR MONEY..
      
      
      THOUGHT THE CAMERA IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT IN LOW LIGHT. (CONSIDERING 13MP). ALL OVER A GOOD BUY."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"TURBO A250, A REALLY WORTH PHONE FOR ITS PRICING. FASTER BROWSING, NEW FEATURES, GOOD MULTITASKING SCREEN. CAMERA REASONABLY GOOD. BATTERY BACK SHOULD BE IMPROVED"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"USING THE PHONE FOR TWO DAYS. NEEDED TO CHARGE IT TWO TIMES.
      
      WISH FOR LONGER BATTERY LIFE. ALSO V.SHORT CABLE FOR CHARGING.
      
      OTHERWISE EXCELLENT PHONE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,VERY GOOD MOBILE NICE LOOK BEST QUALITY EASY TO USE NEW AND ADVANCE MOBILE VERY GOOD PRICE VERY FAST WORKING
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"WHAT WE LIKED
      
      
      MICROMAX CANVAS TURBO A250 IS A SLEEK AND STRONG SMARTPHONE. THE CAMERA CLICKS NICE IMAGES, ESPECIALLY THE FRONT FACING CAMERA. THE QUAD CORE PROCESSOR EFFICIENTLY PROVIDES FOR MULTITASKING.FOR BATTERY I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE A POWER USER, THEN THE BATTERY WOULD LAST FOR ONE DAY.
      
      
      WHAT WE DISLIKED
      
      
      THE TOUCH ON THIS PHONE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A FEATURE PACKED HANDSET WITH A DECENT PRICE BUT MICROMAX SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOW COMPETING WITH THE LIKES OF SONY AND SAMSUNG. BOTH OF THESE INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS ARE KNOWN FOR A FEATHER SMOOTH TOUCH.
      
      IF EXPENDABLE MEMORY CARD WAS THERE IT WOULD BE BEST PHONE AS COMPARE TO OTHER PHONES.
      
      
      TO SUM UP
      
      
      MICROMAX CANVAS TURBO A250 HAS LOTS OF SUBSTANCE AND BY THE TIME YOU ARE READING THIS ARTICLE, IT WOULD ALREADY HAVE CARVED A MARKET FOR ITSELF. THE TWO OTHER CONTENDERS IN THE SAME PRICE SEGMENT ARE SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND AND SONY XPERIA C. GALAXY GRAND HAS ONLY 1 GB RAM, DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND A POOR DISPLAY. ON THE OTHER HAND, SONY XPERIA C DOES NOT HAVE EVEN HALF THE LOOKS AND THE PREMIUM FEEL OF THE CANVAS TURBO. AT A PRICE OF RS 18,000/- , THE 2 GB OF RAM ACTS LIKE ICING ON THE CAKE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN ALL-ROUNDER, MICROMAX CANVAS TURBO A250 IS THE DEVICE FOR YOU!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,4,"WHY ON EARTH DO YOU HAVE TO SHOW ""MADE IN CHINA"" SO BOLDLY ?? AM USING THIS PHONE FROM THE PAST 3 MONTHS, FEATURES WORKS PRECISELY AS DESCRIBED, NOTHING NEW TO BE TOLD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT OTHER THAN WHATS ALREADY WRITTEN BY REVIEWERS ACROSS. ONE FLIP SIDE IS THAT THE FEEL IS NOT PREMIUM ENOUGH, WHICH HAS BEEN A MAJOR DISADVANTAGE WITH MICROMAX PHONE, YOU DONT FEEL LIKE HOLDING A STURDY PHONE. THOUGH THE FEATURES ARE UPTO THE MARK OR BEYOND SAMSUNG OR LG... IT STILL LACKS THAT 'KICK' OF A BRANDED PHONE. MATERIAL IS WEAK AND ONE DROP CAN DAMAGE IT EASILY. WORST PART WAS THE ""MADE IN CHINA""STICKER ON THE BACK OF THE PHONE. :("
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"1. I CAN RUN SUBWAY SURFER W/O AND HUNG WITH INTERNET AND OTHER AP RUNNING
      
      WHICH PROVES THAT MOBILE PERFORMANCE IS GOOD. WHICH IS GENERALLY NOT THE CASE IN OTHER ANDROID PHONE.
      
      2. CAMERA IS GOOD BUT DONT GET ATTRACTED BY NUMBERS(13 MP). ITS NOT AS GR8 AS 13 MP. HDR AND 3G PANAROMA IS GOOD.SOME MORE FEATURES ARE GOOD TOO BUT OVERALL CAMERA IS OK AND NOT VERY EXCELLENT.
      
      3.MUSIC -HEADPHONE IS GOOD.
      
      4.BATTERY IS AVERAGE LIKE OTHER SMART PHONES.IF YOU ARE HEAVY USER OF CAMERA OR INTERNET THEN U NEED TO CHARGE IT TWICE A DAY
      
      5.PHONE GOT HUNG ONCE. IT GOT RECOVERED TOO BUT GOT SCARED TO SEE NEW PHONE HUNG FOR NO REASON.
      
      I GOT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART BUT IN SNAPDEAL I CAN SEE ITS AVAILABLE WITH EVEN LESS PRICE.
      
      ITS NICE DEAL IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY SMART PHONE FOR FIRST TIME USER."

Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"AS AN USER OF IPHONE 4S 16GB, ALL MY FRIENDS THOUGHT I WENT INSANE WHEN I WANTED TO DROP IT FOR A CANVAS TURBO. WELL AFTER THREE MONTHS NEITHER AM I TOO DISAPPOINTED NOR AM I EXCITED ABOUT THE PHONE. HERE IS MY LIST OF PROS AND CONS. I HOPE IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR FUTURE BUYERS:-
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      1. THE PHONE GETS HANGED IF YOU GET A NUMBER OF PHOTOS ON WHATSAPP WHILE USING SWIFTKEY AT THE SAME TIME.
      
      2. EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A 2GB RAM, ASPHALT 8 AND REAL RACING MISS SCREENS.
      
      3. STILL WAITING FOR A QUALCOMM  PROCESSOR FROM MICROMAX.
      
      4. FLASHY MICROMAX INBUILT APPS LIKE IFLOAT TRAY, BLOW TO OPEN ARE JUST A GIMMICK.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. THE PHONE IS A KILLER CONSIDERING THE PRICE. THIS PHONE OUTPACES THE GALAXY S3 IN PERFORMANCE ANYDAY.
      
      2. I LOVE WHERE MICROMAX IS HEADING.
      
      3. THE FRONT CAMERA DOES QUITE A GOOD JOB.
      
      4. APART FROM HEAVY GAMING THERE IS NO PERFORMANCE LAG.
      
      
      I HAVENT BEEN TO THE SERVICE CENTRE. SO NO COMMENTS REGARDING IT.
      
      
      WISHING MICROMAX GOOD LUCK FOR FUTURE ENDEAVORS."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"AS COMPARED TO THE PRICE &AMP; SPECIFICATION, THE PRODUCT IS GOOD..................
      
      THE ONLY THING WHICH LACKS IS THE INBUILT SOFTWARE SUPPORT AND BATTERY BACKUP, WHICH IS WORST. YOU CANNOT EVEN OPERATE DIFFERENT THEMES &AMP; GAMES SMOOTHLY AS COMPARED TO OTHER BRANDED PRODUCTS LIKE S3 OR SIMILAR...............
      
      
      THE ONLY POSITIVE POINT OF THIS PRODUCT IS THE 13MP CAMERA AND THE LOOKS.................
      
      
      MICROMAX HAS BEEN ABLE TO BRING THEIR PRODUCT INTO THE COMPETITION AND NOW IT SHOULD NOT LACK BEHIND ONLY DUE TO COUPLE OF ISSUES......... TEAM PLEASE TRY AND PROVIDE A GOOD CUTOMIZED SOFTWARE SUPPORT..........."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"BATTERY BACK IS POOR
      
      REAR CAMERA IS VERY VERY POOR CONSIDERING IT IS 13 MP
      
      HANGS A LOT
      
      LOW MEMORY SPACE
      
      
      THOUGH DURING THE CALL VOICE CLEARITY IS FINE
      
      LIGHT WEIGHT.
      
      
      OVERALL IT IS A DISAPPOINT FOR ME"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"BOUGHT IT AND USED IT, FELT UNHAPPY. REALLY BAD MOBILE.
      
      
      +VE: SPEED IS GOOD, CLARITY EXCELLENT, HEADPHONES R VERY NICE.
      
      -VE : NO FLIP COVER, HANGING PROBLEM, SOMETIMES SUDDENLY SCREEN WILL BE SWITCHED OFF WITH ONLY BLUE SCREEN AND BUILD UP LOT OF HEAT."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"BOUGHT WITH IMPRESSION THAT ONE IS 6 SIM PIN AND OTHER ONE MICRO SIM, BUT REALIZED ONLY AFTER I GOT IT IN MY HANDS THAT BOTH ARE MICRO SIM TRAYS! USED IT FOR A WEEK, SO FOR SO GOOD.
      
      POINTS TO NOTE B4 YOU BUY IT:
      
      1. SOME OF THE PRELOADED APPS KEEP RUNNING.. U CAN'T GET RID OF THEM UNLESS YOU DISABLE THEM!
      
      2. STANDARD BACK BUTTON IS BIT ANNOYING WHILE PLAYING GAMES AS YOU ACCIDENTLY TOUCH IT AND YOU ARE OUT OF THE GAME :)
      
      3. SLUGGISH EVEN FOR MODERATE GRAPHICS GAMES LIKE JETPACK JOYRIDE..
      
      4. EARPHONE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT SO GOOD..
      
      5. PLAYING AN HD VIDEO TUNNEL YOUR BATTERY SO FAST THAT BEFORE YOU FINISH A MOVIE IT BEGS FOR JUICE!!
      
      6. SUPPORTS OTG CABLE AND EASY TO MOVE THE FILES.
      
      
      OVERALL, FOR 14K, ITS A BANG FOR A BUCK PHONE!!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"COMPARING TO OTHER MOBILE PRICE IS LITTLE BIT HIGH AND ALSO PERFORMANCE ALSO AS NOT GOOD, SOME TIME IT HANGING WHILE USING MORE THEN ONE APP, NOT WORTH FOR MONEY..............."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,DOES IT NAVIGATION TECHNOLOGY WORKS SIMILAR TO A-GPS. MEANS GIVE DIRECTION AND VOICE SUPPORT ON THE MOVE WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE ???
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS GOOD . I WOULD EVEN ACCEPT 2000 MAH BATTERY FOR A SHORTCOMING.
      
      
      NO SD CARD SLOT WOULD BE OK - BUT ONLY 0.98 GB FOR APPS INSTALLATION ? THIS IS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKER !
      
      THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A HIGH END PHONE &AMP; FOLLOWING THE LIGHTS OF OTHER BIG BRAND COMPANIES , MMX DECIDED TO ELIMINATE SD CARD SLOT (I THINK THEY WILL RELEASE A 32GB VERSION OF IT)
      
      
      BUT THAT ONE REASON IS ENOUGH FOR NOT BUYING THIS PHONE !! SUCH LIMITED APPS INSTALLATION SPACE FOR A HIGH END PHONE IS PATHETIC !"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"EXCEPT BELOW MENTIONED ISSUE PHONE IS GOOD
      
      
      INTERNAL STORAGE IS 12GB BUT PHONE STORAGE IS ONLY 1GB WHICH IS BIG DRAWBACK BECS SOME APPS ARE NOT MOVABLE TO INTERNAL STORAGE SO IT CONSUMES PHONE STORAGE MEMORY THAT IS ONLY 1GB AND ALSO I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY OPTION TO SET CUSTOM RINGTONE YET, IF SOMEONE HAVE IDEA HOW TO SET CUSTOM RINGTONE PLZ LET ME KNOW."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"FEATURES OF CANVAS BEATS SONY, HTC AND OTHERS WHICH WE WILL NEVER GET IN 16K.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. CAMERA HANGS WHILE OPENING THE SAME. BUT IT GETS FIXED IF YOU RESTART THE SAME.
      
      2. CHARGING FROM 99% TO 100% TAKES AROUND 30 MINS WHICH LOOKS LIKE A DEFECT.
      
      
      OTHER THAN THESE, NICE PHONE WITHIN A BUDGET OF 20K."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"FIRST LETS AGREE THAT MMX TURBO HAS 3 MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS OVER CANVAS 4 VIZ. 2GB RAM, 1.5 QUAD PROCESSOR, FULL HD DISPLAY. THEY HAVE MADE A GLARING OMISSION IN NOT PROVIDING SD CARD SLOT! (OTG CABLE CAN BE USED I GUESS).BESIDES FLIP POUCH?
      
      THEREFORE IS THE 3 K PREMIUM OVER CANVAS 4 JUSTIFIED?
      
      MY VIEW IS THAT CANVAS 4 IS STILL THEIR FLAGSHIP..ITS A MUCH BETTER BUY!!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"GREAT PHONE UNDER BUDGET.
      
      THE DELIVERY WAS ALSO IN ONE DAY AS ORDERED.
      
      THIS WAS ACTUALLY FOR A FRIEND GREAT BUDGET PHONE AS HIS CHOICE WAS GOOD
      
      THE OVERALL BUILD QUALITY ALSO IS GOOD FEELS GOOD IN HAND"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"I AM NOT SATISFIED W/
      
      1) EAR PHONE SOUND QUALITY ( DISGUSTING ) I TRIED W/ OTHER HEAD PHONE TOO. NO CHANGE
      
      2) LAGS SOME TIME ( EVAN USING 3,4 TASK AT A TIME. WHAT THE HELL USE OF THIS 2GB RAM &AMP; PROCESSOR )
      
      3) BATTERY BACKUP IS MAJOR ISSUE W/ THIS PHONE . LAST FOR 14 HRS MAX.
      
      
      APART FROM THIS ITS A GOOD BUY.
      
      
      VERY LIGHT WEIGHT."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"I BOUGHT MICROMAX CANVAS TURBO ABOUT 2 MONTHS BACK, WELL TO BE HONEST IT DELIVERED TO MY EXPECTATIONS PARTLY.... WELL THE DISPLAY IS GOOD, SOUND IS GOOD, STORAGE MEMORY OF 16 GB IS A PLUS TOO BUT THE INTERNAL MEMORY (1 GB) FOR APPS IS NOT SUFFICIENT, PLUS THERE ARE APPS INSTALLED THAT  YOU DON'T EVEN NEED... CONSUMING YOUR PRECIOUS SPACE FOR APP INSTALLATION. PICTURE QUALITY FOR A 13 MP CAMERA IS DISAPPOINTING TOO. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY THIS PHONE FOR GAMING OR SOMETHING I WILL SAY DON'T... IT DIED ON ME TWICE WHILE I WAS USING WHATSAPP...!!!
      
      YES ITS TRUE... FOR REST MAILS, CHATS, YOUTUBE, GOOGLE APPS ITS GOOD... EVEN RUNS WORD N PDFS WELL."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AT RS 15999.  IT WAS SUPERB, BUT AS DAYS PASSED ON I NOTICED MANY CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS:
      
      1) WITH A SIMPLE APP LIKE WHATSPP AND FACEBOOK IT WAS GETTING HEATED UP.
      
      2) TWO TIMES CELL GOT HANGED. AS WE CANNOT REMOVE BATTERY  STILL BY LUCK IT GOT RETARDED.
      
      3) SOMETIMES WITHOUT USING ALSO BATTERY GOES DOWN AND HEATED UP.
      
      4) I COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS PHONE TO FLIPKART 3 TO 4 TIMES BUT STILL TEY ARE TELLING ITS A SOFTWARE PROBLEM AND THEY TOLD ME TO FACTORY RESET THE CELL, AS PER THEIR INSTRUCTION I DID THE SAME . BUT AFTER REINSTALLING ALL THE APP SAME PROBLEM IS REPEATING.
      
      5) 2 GB RAM IS USELESS FOR MIDIATECK PROCESSOR
      
      6) BATTERY DRAIN VERY FAST WHEN UR USING 3G. WITHIN 30 SEC 1% IS GETTING DECREASED.
      
      
      POSITIVE POINTS
      
      1) SCREEN IS TOO GOOD NO DOUBT ITSS SUPER CRISPY. I LOVED THE SCREEN.
      
      2) SLIM SIZE.
      
      3) BOTH CAMERAS ARE TOO GOOD . WE CAN DO CLEAR WEB CHAT ON SKYPE.
      
      I DON'T KNOW IF I GOT FAULTY PIECE FROM FLIP KART. BUT STILL IF YOU WANNA BUY THEN THINK AND BUY. I SOLD THIS CELL AFTER 15 DAYS FOR 13000."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"I DIDNT BOUGHT IT FROM FLIPKART. ITS VERY NICE,GOOD BUILD QUALITY AND EVERYTHNG ELSE BUT THE AIN DISSAPOINTING FACTOR IS U CANT PLAY HEAVY GAMES LIKE ASPHALT 7 ETC BECAUSE ITS FPS IS VERY LOW. U CAN CHECK IT OUT ON IGYAAN.COM
      
      BEST FOR FIRST TIME USERS NOT FOR GAMERS"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS NOW. HERE ARE THE PROS AND CONS:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1. PRICED JUST ABOUT RIGHT (WHEN I BOUGHT IT; HAS DROPPED NOW).
      
      2. NOT TOO MANY ADDONS.
      
      3. DUAL SIM.
      
      4. FM RADIO.
      
      
      CONS:

      2. AVERAGE STILL CAMERA PERFORMANCE. NO SHARP PICTURES EVEN IN DAYLIGHT AT MAX RES.
      
      3. POOR AUDIO IN VIDEO CAPTURE.
      
      4. BELOW PAR PERFORMANCE.
      
      5. AND, THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK: LESS THAN 1 GB FOR APPS !"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"IN THIS APP HUNGRY WORLD, HOW WILL A 1GB FOR APP INSTALLATION SUFFICIENT ? ..
      
      MICROMAX IS STILL IN ITS OLD DAYS I GUESS."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,IS THE LENGTH OF THE MOBILE ACTUALLY 128 MM AS GIVEN IN THE SPECIFICATIOS?BECAUSE IT LOOKS BIGGER IN THE PHOTOS...AND SOME REVIEWS HAS SHOWN THE LENGTH AS 143MM?
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE OFFERED. GOOD FEATURES. WORKS OK.. CAN DOBETTER. HEATS UP ALL OF A SUDDEN.. NOT SURE IF THAT IS SPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"ITS BATTERY NEEDS DAILY CHARGE EVENTHOUGH THE USAGE IS BARE MINIMUM.  FURTHER, THE PHONE GETS HEATED EVEN WHEN IT IS SWITCHED ON FOR LESS THAN ONE MINUTE"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,ITS GOOD OF ALL BUT NOT SATISFIED FULL EXPECTATION. SD CARD SLOT CAN BE PROVIDED. RAM IS 2GB BUT ITS NOT WORKING UPTO STANDARD OF OTHER MOBILES HAVING 2GB RAM.
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"ITS PRETTY DESCENT PHONE AND I AM HAPPY WITH PHONE PERFORMANCE SO FAR. BUT PHONES GET HEATED VERY SOON AS YOU START USING IT. BATTERY LAST ONLY ONE DAY HARDLY, YOU WOULD NEED TO CHARGE IT TWICE A DAY IF YOU NEED TO USE FOR MORE HOURS"

      WHATEVER THE DEFECTS, THE PHONE IS WORTH FOR THE MONEY.
      
      
      STILL WILL UPDATE ON FURTHER USAGE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"PRICE IS GOOD
      
      BUT HANGS TOO MUCH AND SINCE THERE IS NO REMOVABLE BATTERY, YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE BATTERY DIES AND THEN RECONNECT TO THE CHARGER AND THEN SWITCH ON THE PHONE
      
      
      SO DO NOT INSERT/USE BOTH SIM (THEN WHAT IS THE USE OF BUYING A DUAL SIM PHONE??????)
      
      WORKS WELL WITH SINGLE SIM USAGE
      
      
      ALSO THE BATTERY LASTS VERY LESS
      
      
      SO DO NOT BUY IF YOU WOULD BE USING TWO SIM"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"THE NEW MICROMAX TURBO A250, I HAVE RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS PHONE. HAS A VERY GOOD TOUCH BUT PHONE PERFORMANCE IS NOT SO GOOD. GETS HANG EVERY NOW N DEN &AMP; THIS HAS BEEN THE MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS PHONE. ALSO YOU CANT CHAT ON MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS... PHONE RESPONDS VERY SLOW TO THE COMMAND......."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,THIS IS A VERY GOOD PHONE WITH GREAT FEATURES AND VERY FAST PROCESSOR. THE MAIN DRAWBACK IS ITS HANGING WHEN CAMERA IS SWITCHED ON. I WOULD REQUEST MICROMAX TO FIX THIS ISSUE IMMEDIATELY AS IT IS VERY ANNOYING. ONE MORE DRAWBACK IS WHENEVER SOME TXT IS ARRIVED IT IS DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN IMMEDIATELY WHEN PHONE SCREEN IS OFF TOO WHICH IS NOT A GOOD THING AS SOMETIMES WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE TXT BY OTHERS
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,THIS MOB. IS SUPERB EXCEPT BATTERY LIFE. BATTERY HAS BEEN DISCHARGE  IN 3-4 HRS. OTHER THAN ITS FAR BETTER THAN SAMSUNG GALAXY S4
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD UNDER 30K. BUT IT HAS ONLY TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS 1. THERE IS NO EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD SLOT AS FOR OUR GENERATION 12 GB IS NOT MUCH MORE ON FHD SCREEN AND
      
      2ND IS THAT ONLY 2000MAH BATTTERY AT -441PPI FHD SCREEN... IF MMX SHOULD RESOLVE THESE PROBLEMS THEN IT WOULD BE A PERFECT COMPETITOR OF GALAXY S4 AND XPERIA ZR"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,TWO OF MY FRIENDS BOUGHT CANVAS TURBO COJ THEIR CANVAS HD WORKED SMOOTH. BUT TURBO HANGS ALOT AND THERE IS NO OPTION TO REMOVE BATTERY .. SO U HAVE TO GO TO CARE. BETTER  BUY GIONEE HANDSET IN THE SAME RANGE.. MICROMAX PLEASE STOP REBRANDING OF CHINESE PHONES . SEARCH IN GOOGLE WIKO DARKFULL. YOU WILL SEE ITS JUST A REBRANDED PHONE
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,3,"WELL, FIRST OF ALL THANKS TO FLIPKART AND WS RETAIL FOR AS USUAL PROMPT DELIVERY (WITHIN 2 DAYS).
      
      
      I COMPARED THE CONFIGURATIONS OF THIS CELL WITH SAME PRICE RANGE MOBILES AND DECIDED TO GO WITH MMX.
      
      
      FIRST THING YOU WILL NOTICE IS VERY GOOD BUILD QUALITY. ALSO IT IS MUCH LIGHTER THAN ITS PREVIOUS MMX CANVAS VERSIONS.
      
      
      PROS :
      
      1) GOOD BUILD QUALITY.
      
      2) VERY SMOOTH PERFORMANCE : I PLAYED FEW HEAVY GAMES LIKE INTO THE DARK, TEMPLE RUN, SUBWAY SURFER ETC. THERE WAS NO LAG AT ALL. THE RESPONSE TIME IS VERY LOW WHICH GIVES VERY GOOD FEEL.
      
      3) IFLOAT APPLICATION : THOUGH SIMILAR APPS ARE PRESENT ON GOOGLE PLAY MARKET, THIS IN-BUILD FUNCTIONALITY LOOKS GOOD. IT ALLOWS YOU TO PERFORM PARALLEL TASKING. YOU CAN SURF INTERNET AND READ SMS AT THE SAME TIME. THIS FEATURE SEEMS VERY COOL TO ME.
      
      4) SPEAKERS : I HEARD IN ITS REVIEW THAT THE SPEAKERS ARE OF NOT THAT MUCH QUALITY BUT WHEN I PLAYED SOME LOUD AND SOME SOFT MUSIC TRACKS, I DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY BAD QUALITY SOUND. THEY ARE WORKING PERFECTLY FINE.
      
      5) HD SCREEN : THE FULL HD DISPLAY IS JUST AWESOME. YOU WILL ENJOY WATCHING HD MOVIES AND PLAYING HD GAMES ON IT.
      
      6) HD RECORDING : THE VIDEO RECORDING QUALITY IS VERY VERY GOOD.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      1) CAMERA PIC QUALITY : THOUGH 13MP REAR CAMERA IS PROVIDED WITH DOUBLE LED FLASH, THE PICTURE QUALITY UNDER LOW LIGHT (EVEN FOR INDOOR PICS) IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. THIS IS THE MOST DEPRESSING THING FOR A 13MP CAMERA. MMX NEEDS TO WORK ON THIS AREA.
      
      
      2) HEADSET QUALITY : I USED TO LISTEN MUSIC WITH PHILIPS HEADSETS ON MY SAMSUNG GALAXY POCKET. MMX HEADSET QUALITY IS NOWHERE NEAR TO PHILIPS. I INSTALLED SOME MUSIC PLAYERS AND TRIED THEIR EQUILISER OPTIONS TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY (AS IN-BUILD MUSIC PLAYER IS NOT GOOD AND ITS EQUILISER IS AS GOOD AS DEAD). IT MADE THE SOUND QUALITY BETTER BUT NOT UPTO MY EXPECTATION. I MAY BE OVER EXPECTING IN THIS MATTER BECAUSE I LOVE MUSIC AND CANT COMPROMISE WITH SOUND QUALITY AT ALL.
      
      
      3) HEATING : YEAH, THE CELL HEATS UP IN CASE OF HEAVY USE. WELL NOT AN ISSUE BUT IT MAY SEEM TROUBLESOME TO FEW USERS.
      
      
      OVERALL, THE PIC IS VERY GOOD COMPARED TO OTHER CELLS IN THIS PRICE RANGE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"AS I HAD GONE THROUGH THE PHONE IT IS NOT EXPANDABLE.. BUT HAS INTERNAL MEMORY OF 16 GB BUT THE HIDDEN DEMERIT IS YOU CAN ONLY USE 0.98 GB MEMORY FOR APPS DOWNLOAD IF THAT 0.98 GB MEMORY IS FULL THEN YOU CANT DOWNLOAD MORE.. THUS IT IS LIMITED FOR APPS DOWNLOAD AND REST 13 GB YOU CAN USE FOR DATA STORAGE (I.E SONGS, MOVIE, ETC) AND REST FACTORS IN THIS PHONE IS NICE!!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"AS I THOUGHT ABOUT IT'S PERFORMANCE THIS ONE DOES'NT FULL FILL MY EXPECTATIONS. I M SUFFERING WITH SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS PHONE AS BELOW..
      
      O-- LOW SPEAKER VOICE DURING CALL..
      
      0-- SOME TIMES IT'S HANG AND U WILL DO NOTHING WITH IT WHILE IT'S REBOOT ITSELF..
      
      AND ANOTHER DRAWBACK FOR ME MEMORY RESTRICTION ONLY 12 GB INBUILT..."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"BATTERY
      
      2000MAH BATTERY IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO HANDLE THESE SPECS. (PS. SOME GUY WROTE THAT BATTERY LASTS FOR A DAY AND HALF. YOU WILL REALIZE IT PRETTY SOON, THAT THIS PERFORMANCE WILL LAST NOT MORE THAN 2 MONTHS. AND BATTERY WILL START DRAINING OUT VERY QUICKLY)
      
      IT IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH....................
      
      
      STORAGE
      
      I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THIS.....NO EXTRA MEMORY CARD SLOT?????
      
      MICROMAX IS REPUTED FOR PUTTING ALL FEATURES IN AA RELATIVELY CHEAPER DEVICE. HOW CAN YOU MISS OUT ON THIS???????????
      
      
      I DONT KNOW IF THEY WILL LAUNCH ANOTHER MODEL WITH 32GB OR NOT.TOO............................."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"GOOD SCREEN PPI , BUT ACCORDING TO THE PROCESSOR SPEED THE OPENING OF APPS TAKE A BIT TIME. MENU NAVIGATION IS NOT AT ALL SMOOTH. CANVAS HD WAS BETTER THAN THIS MOBILE. FOR THIS RANGE DON'T GO FOR THIS MOBILE. GO FOR NOKIA LUMIA 720 OR 625. NOT AT ALL SATISFIED WITH THIS MOBILE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"GUYS DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT ITS NOT WORTH.... DON'T GET FOOLED BY ITS CHEAP PRICE AND UNNECESSARY FEATURES...... 1) ITS TOUCH IS NOT VERY RECEPTIVE
      
      2) PHONE GETS HEATED A LOT WHILE PLAYING GAMES
      
      3) DESPITE OF HAVING 2 GB RAM AND 1.5 GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR THERE IS A TIME LAG BETWEEN SHUFFLING OF APPS
      
      4) BLOW TO UNLOCK IS K... JUST K.... SHAKE TO UNLOCK IS NOT VERY RECEPTIVE.....PHONE HANGS AT TIME
      
      WHY DID I BUY THIS.... IF I WERE TO WRITE 3 MISTAKE OF MY LIFE , THIS WOULD BE MY FIRST MISTAKE...... DON'T GET FOOLED BY FEATURES OF THIS CELL MORE THEN HALF OF THEM DON'T WORK.......... I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW ON 27TH FEB , CELL WAS DELIVERED TO ME ON 26TH FEB JUST A DAY OLD CELL IS THIS BAD , I WONDER WHAT WILL IT BE IN FUTURE........
      
      WS RETAIL , SELLER OF THIS PHONE ON FLIP KART IS GOOD ... THIS IS MY SECOND CELL FROM W/S RETAIL ...."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"HERE ARE MY THOUGHTS/FINDINGS ABOUT A250 AFTER USING ALMOST OVER A MONTH,
      
      
      THE BIGGEST DISADVANTAGE OF THIS PHONE IS, SOMETIMES IT GETS HANG &AMP; YOU JUST CAN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE IT HAS INBUILT BATTRY &AMP; NO OPTIONS TO SHUTDOWN THE PHONE.
      
      
      BATTRY BACKUP ISN'T AS GOOD AS WE EXEPCTED FORM THIS SO ONCE YOU WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR PHONE INSTEAD BATTRY ONCE YOUR BATTRY LIFE IS OVER.
      
      
      THE ABOVE TWO FACTS ARE THE MOST COMMON THAT WE LOOK FOR IN A MOBILE........... THANK YOU!!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,I  PURCHASED   MICROMAX TURBO A250 ONE AND HALF MONTH   BACK  . DISAPPOINTED  BY  BUYING  THIS  PHONE . CAMERA  IS  NOT  FUNCTIONING  PROPERLY  RIGHT  FROM  DAY  ONE . CAN NOT TAKE PHOTOS  DURING  NIGHT / LOW  LIGHT. MICROMAX MUST  MAINTAIN  SOME  QUALITY  STANDARD . THE  REAR  COVER  HAS  POOR  ABRASION  RESISTANCE .  PRIOR  TO  BUYING  THIS  HANDSET  I  HAD  PURCHASED  A210  THROUGH  FLIPKART  WHICH  WAS  NOT  STARTING  ONLY  AND  FLIPKART  REPALCED  IT  WITHIN  ONE  DAY  AT  GOA . IS  THIS  IS  QUALITY  ASSURANCE  LEVEL  MICROMAX  SHOULD HAVE ? ARE  WE  PAYING  LESS  MONEY  FOR  PRODUCTS  MADE  IN  CHINA ?  CAN  MICROMAX  OR  FLIPKART  HELP  ME  RSOLVE  PROBELM  WITH  CAMERA ??????????
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"I BOUGHT MICROMAX CANVAS TURBO A250 FOR RS 18000/- ODD.  IT WAS STATED THAT IT IS COMPARABLE WITH SAMSUNG 4S.  HOWEVER, IT IS NOT EVEN COMPARABLE WITH SAMSUNG  S-3.  ITS BATTERY PERFORMANCE  IS POOR WHICH DOES NOT WORK EVEN FOR 6 HOURS WHILE IN ROAMING.  ITS TOURCH SCREEN IS ALSO POOR. ITS SPEAKERS QUALITY IS ALSO NOT GOOD.  I WILL NOT SUGGEST TO PURCHASE THIS PHONE AT THIS COST."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO , AND SOLD IT TODAY , I WON'T GO INTO ALL THE SPECS AND ALL THAT STUFF CAUSE GUYS CAN OBVIOUSLY CAN SEE IT .  TO BE VERY FRANK ITS NOT A BAD DEVICE AT ALL , I MEAN ITS GOT ALL THE GOOD SPECS ON PAPER BUT I DIDN'T FOUND THIS DEVICE GREAT WITH A IN HAND USE . IVE USED AN IPHONE BEFORE AND ALSO A GS3 SO THEREFORE THE BUILD QUALITY DIDN'T IMPRESSED ME A LOT , ITS SUPPOSED TO BE A METAL UNIBODY DESIGN , BUT IT GIVES A PLASTIC FEEL , AND ALSO ITS VERY SLIPPERY TO HOLD , THE HD DISPLAY IS GOOD BUT AWESOME , AND EVEN WITH GOOD SPECS ON BOARD , ITS A BIT LAGGY . TO PUT INTO SIMPLE WORDS I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS HOLDING A 20 K DEVICE , BUT EVEN THAN ITS A GOOD EFFORT BY THE COMPANY , THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO UPGRADE FROM THERE OLDER MICROMAX DEVICE MIGHT LIKE IT , BUT ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE USED SAMSUNG AND APPLE SMARTPHONE'S I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO FIRST TAKE A LOOK AT A DEMO DEVICE IN YOUR LOCAL MARKETS AND PROBABLY THAN DECIDE IF IT SUITS YOUR NEEDS OF A COMPLETE AND A FLAGSHIP SMARTFONE ."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"I DIDN'T BOUGHT THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART BUT I WANT TO TELL THAT THE PHONE HANGS WHILE CALLING AND WHILE WORKING ON IT , IT HANGS MORE THAN TWO TIMES A DAY AND JUST BOUGHT IT 7 DAYS BEFORE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"I THINK 20K ALSO NOT SMALL AMOUNT.IF YOU CAN SPEND 20K THEN YOU CAN PUT 2 OR 3K MORE.
      
      MY ADVICE TO ALL PLZ DON'T BUY IT, GO FOR NEXUS 4.(THE ULTIMATE BEAST IN THIS PRICE RANGE)"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"I WOULD JUST LIKE TO WARN PEOPLE OF 1 THING BEFORE THEY BUY ANY MOBILE DEVICE OF ANY BRAND.
      
      
      I HAD BROUGHT A MMX 116 FEW MONTHS AGO, WHEN IT WAS HYPED WITHOUT ANY OTHER DETAILS. AFTER USING IT FOR 1 MONTH IN JULY 2013, THE CELL STARTED HAVING SOME ISSUE, USE TO REBOOT ON ITS OWN, SCREEN GOING BLANK OR TOUCH BEING UNRESPONSIVE, I GAVE THE CELL TO MMX SERVICE CENTRE IN PUNE, I WAS ASKED TO CALL BACK IN 10 DAYS, WHEN I CALLED BACK ON 11TH DAY, THEY SAID IT WAS WIP (WORK IN PROGRESS) WILL NEED ANOTHER ""COUPLE OF DAY"" NEXT TIME I WAITED 5 DAYS AND WENT ON 22ND JULY TO SERVICE CENTRE AND WAS TOLD THE SOC HAD SOME ISSUE, WILL NEED 15 DAYS TO HAVE IT FIXED, I AGAIN WENT BACK TO MMX SC ON 12TH AUG, I WAS AGAIN TOLD TO WAIT, I LOST MY PATIENCE AS I HAD CALLED MMX SC MANY TIMES IN BETWEEN. SO I DECIDED TO GIVE THEM A PIECE OF MY MIND AND SOME OF MY ANGER BY YELLING A BIT
      
      
      I WAITED AGAIN AS I HAD NO OPTION, CALLED AND EMAILED MMX ABOUT THE ISSUE AND DELAY WITHOUT ANY LUCK  AND MET MANY PPL IN MMX SERVICE CENTER WHO HAD GIVEN THEIR HANDSET FOR MINOR REPAIRS AND HAD TO WAIT FOR MONTHS TO GET THEIR HANDSET BACK. YES YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT URSELF AT YOUR LOCAL SERVICE CENTRES OR ASKING YOUR FRIEND WHO HAD TO DEAL WITH SUCH ISSUES. I GOT MY CELL BACK WITH LOT OF SCRATCHES AND UGLY CONDITION ON 17TH OCT 2013 AND NOW I FOUND A NEW PROBLEM, THAT THE CALL JUST DROPS IN MIDDLE OR EVEN WHEN YOU ARE NEAR A AIRTEL TOWER, YOU WILL LOSE THE MOBILE TOWER SIGNAL AND SOMETIMES IN MIDDLE OF TALK THE VOICE JUST DIES
      
      MIND YOU I HAD NOT ROOTED OR DID ANY OTHER CHANGE ON HANDSET AND I USE AIRTEL IN PUNE
      
      
      AFTER SOME RESEARCH I FOUND THAT ALL INDIAN SO CALLED CELL MANUFACTURER ESSENTIALLY BUY A ALREADY DEVELOPED SOC FROM CHINESE MAKERS AND REBRAND THEM WITH THEIR OWN LOGO, 99% OF INDIAN MANUFACTURER WHO DO THIS LACK THE FOLLOWING
      
      -- HAND IN DEVELOPMENT OF ANY HANDSET OR DESIGN IDEA OF THE SOC
      
      -- THEY HAVE NO IN HOUSE R&AMP;D OR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
      
      -- THEY HAVE NO TRAINED ENGINEERS OR A INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE THEY CAN FIX THE HARDWARE RELATED ISSUES
      
      -- THEY ARE THEMSELVES CUSTOMER TO THE CHINESE MAKERS SO HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO FIX ISSUE AND HAVE NO PROPER CHANNELS TO COMMUNICATE SO CAN NEVER GIVE YOU CLEAR ANSWER ON WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR HANDSET OR WHEN YOU MIGHT GET IT BACK THEY JUST KEEP ASKING TIME WITH WISHFUL THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE SOLVED BY THAT TIME
      
      
      SO ALL THESE MAKERS SEND THOSE HANDSETS BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER AND THEN EITHER GET REPLACEMENT OR FACTORY REPAIRED CELLS WHICH THEY USE AS REPLACEMENT AND HENCE THE DELAY. SO BEFORE YOU BUY SUCH SETS BEWARE
      
      
      SO THE MORAL OF THE STORY, WHEN YOU BUY SUCH HANDSETS, PRAY IT DOES NOT GET BAD OR SPEND LITTLE MORE FOR OLD SPEC PHONE FROM BRANDED SET MANU LIKE SAMSUNG, SONY, LG, NOKIA
      
      EITHER WAY ITS A COMPROMISE FOR US AS ALL MANUFACTURER TREAT US AS 3RD GRADE CITIZENS AND THINK WE DESERVE CRAP
      
      
      WE ARE BIGGEST CONSUMER OF GOODS YET WE GET CRAP, JUST GOOGLE HOW SMASUNG TREAT US AND HOW THEY TREAT AMERICANS
      
      EG OCTA CORE SAMSUNG GALAXY  S4 (2 QUAD CORE MADE OCTA LOL) IN INDIA WHILE US GOT S4 WITH SNAPDRAGON 600, THE PRICE OF US VERSION IS APPROX 35,000 INR WHILE WE GET A INFERIOR VERSION AT 40,000)"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"ISSUES I FACED :-
      
      1. MOST OF THE TIMES CAMERA STOPS WORKING. I HAVE TO RESTART THE PHONE, SOMETIMES 2/3 TIMES RESTART IS REQUIRED TO GET THE CAMERA WORKING.
      
      2. HANGS LIKE ANYTHING. I AM DOUBT WHAT MMX IS CLAIMING IT HAS 2GB RAM.
      
      3. I USE SKYPE MOST AND SKYPE DONT RECOGNIZE ME WHEN I LOG OFF AND LOG ON AGAIN. TO RESOLVE THIS I HAVE TO RE-INSTALL THE APP. (THIS MIGHT BE COMPATIBILITY ISSUE OF SKYPE WITH HANDSET BUT THIS NEVER HAPPEND EARLIER BECAUSE I HAVE USED NOTE AND MMX A116).
      
      
      NOW IT IS WORKING FINE FOR FEW DAYS.
      
      
      BUT PERSONALLY I HAVE USED A116 (MICROMAX PRODUCT) AND IT WAS OSSUME PIECE.
      
      BUT A250 DISAPPOINTED A BIT."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,2,"ITS AMAZING ON PART OF MICROMAX TO INTRODUCE QUAD CORE 6589T (TURBO) PROCESSOR WITH 2GB RAM, AND FHD DISPLAY UNDER 20K MARK.

      IF MEMORY AND BATTERY DOESNT CONCERN U, THIS IS THE BEST PHN IN MRKT TODAY UNDER 20000, BUT IN TOTAL, IT IS A FAIL.
      
      
      BETTER GO FOR CANVAS 4, WITH 16GB MEMORY AND TRUST ME 1 GB RAM IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.
      
      FOR GAMING CANVAS TURBO IS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN CANVAS 4,, BUT OTHER THAN THAT CANVAS 4 BEATS TURBO EASILY.."

      AND ITS AFTER SALE SERVICE IS EVEN BAD I WENT TO MICROMAX SERVICE CENTRE THERE A MAN WAS FIGHTING BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MONTH STILL HE DID NOT GOT HIS PHONE REPAIR"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"HI, I BOUGHT 2 CANVAS PHONES A100 AND A110. I STARTED FACING ISSUES WITH BOTH THE PHONES AFTER 6 MONTHS OF USE. APPROACHED CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER AND REALIZED ITS FOR NAME SAKE. MMX DOES NOT EVEN HAVE A DEDICATED CENTER, THEY SHARE IT WITH HUAWEI AND GOD KNOWS WHO. STAFF IS SO RUDE AND NOT HELPFUL AT ALL, I HAD TO VISIT SERVICE CENTER 4 TIMES TO GET THESE CROOKS ACCEPT MY PHONE FOR A REPAIR. TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT IF YOUR PHONE IS IN WARRANTY, THESE CROOKS WILL MAKE ALL POSSIBLE EXCUSES TO NOT ACCEPT YOUR PHONE. THE ONES I HAD TO FACE WERE, ""SERVER IS DOWN, CANNOT ACCEPT PHONE"" , WAIT FOR AN HOUR AND ONLY THEY WE WILL TAKE THE PHONE, IT WILL TAKE A MONTH TO GET YOUR PHONE BACK DUE TO HUGE BACK LOG.
      
      THOUGH I WAS HAPPY INITIALLY TO BUY MMX HOWEVER DEEPLY REGRET IT NOW. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY A MMX PHONE NOW.
      
      MMX YOU REALLY SHOULD BE CONCENTRATING ON QUALITY AND AFTER SALES RATHER THAN HIRING BIG STAR TO DUPE PEOPLE INTO BUYING YOUR PRODUCT."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"HI, I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT ON MOBILE SPECIFICATION SIDE. RATHER I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT
      
      ON HOW THEIR FOCUS TOWARDS CUSTOMER SATISIFACTION.
      
      I GOT MY MOBILE BROKE DOWN DUE TO SOME REASONS AND I HAVE CHECKED IN @ MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER, BANGALORE FOR IT'S REPAIR &AMP; MADE AN ORDER FOR A LCD DISPLAY KIT OF CANVAS TURBO WHICH GOT DAMAGED. EVEN AFTER PLACING AN ORDER, I HAD TO WAIT FOR MORE THAN 20-25 DAYS &AMP; THE PROBLEM IS NOT YET SOLVED.
      
      I REALLY DID NOT UNDERSTAD THEIR CONCEPT OF SELLING THE PRODUCTS WITHOUT ANY BACKUP PLAN OF SERVICE.
      
      
      IT'S REALLY DISAPPOINTING FROM THE SERVICE SIDE..!!!"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"HOW CAN MICROMAX THINK OF INCREASING PRICES OF THEIR PHONES CONTINEOUSLY. I WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER GALAXY S3 BY PAYING SOME 3K MORE THAN THIS CRAP.
      
      
      THERE IS NO SD CARD AND ONLY 2000MAH BATTERY. IS IT NOT A JOKE WHEN THEY ASK 20K FOR THIS? IF NOT SAMSUNG THEN ANY DAY GIONEE E6 IS BETTER THAN THIS.
      
      
      INDIAN BUYERS WERE GOING FOR MICROMAX AND OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE PROVIDING BEST SMARTPHONE EXPERIENCE UNDER 12K TO MAX 15K RANGE. AGAIN THEY ONLY PROVIDE STOCK OS. COMPARED TO THEM IF WE HAVE TO SPEND 20K PLUS THEN ANY DAY SAMSUNG OR OTHER KNOWN BRAND IS BETTER."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I AM GIVING THIS 1 STAR NOT FOR THE PRODUCT QUALITY BUT THE PEOPLE COMPARING DIFF BRAND GIVEN REVIEWS HERE.
      
      
      I WILL JUST SAY THIS IS TYPICAL INDIAN MENTALITY. IF A PRODUCT SELLS ON LESS PRICE THEY THOUGH QUALITY MAY BE PROBLEM. I AM A QUALITY ENGINEER/ANALYST FOR MOBILE PHONE. I MY SELF TESTED IT PARTS ALONG WITH MOST OF THESE DUMBASS'S FAV NEXUS 4 AND IPHONE 4S, GALAXY S3, BB Z10, HTC1. HOW EVER I AM A FAN OF NO PHONE OTHER THEN IPHONE ONLY I WILL SAY THIS PHONE HAS FAR BETTER PERFORMANCE AND MEMORY FREQUENCY THEN NEXUS, GALAXY AND BB AND ALMOST SAME AS IP AND HTC."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I AM USING THIS MOBILE SINCE 4 DAYS  AND THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH FOR MONEY
      
      CONS
      
      1) MOBILE IS HEATING
      
      2) CAM IS NOT GOOD
      
      3) VIDEO CLARITY IS NOT SO GOOD
      
      4) MP3 PALAYER IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY
      
      
      PLS GUYS DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT...  I'M REALY FED UP WITH QUALTIY OF THE MOBILE"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I BOUGHT A MICROMAX CANVAS TURBO A 250 THROUGH FLIPKART ON 10.02.2013 AND CONTRARY TO SOME OF THE REVIEWS ABOUT THE PRODUCT, I WAS PRETTY DISAPPOINTED.  THE BATTERY I.E. 2000 MAH IS TOTALLY INADEQUATE FOR THE FEATURES OF THE THIS PHONE AND LASTS ONLY FOR 4 TO 5 HOURS.  I AM NOT IN THE HABIT OF PLAYING GAMES OR USING THE CAMERA OFTEN.  WHILE THE PHONE PER SE IS FUNCTIONING ALRIGHT, I HAD TO RETURN THE PHONE TO A SERVICE CENTER IN CHENNAI WHO HAS BEEN KEEPING THE PHONE OVER THE LAST ONE WEEK PROMISING A BATTERY REPLACEMENT.  I HAVE NO HOPE OF ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PHONE AS THEY ARE GOING TO REPLACE THE EXISTING BATTERY WITH THE SAME 2000 MAH BATTERY.
      
      
      IT IS BETTER TO BUY VARIANTS OF RECOGNISED BRANDS RATHER THAN GOING IN FOR THESE VALUE FOR MONEY PROPOSITIONS"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE AND ITS JUST BEEN 1 MONTH IM ALREADY FACING THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROBLEMS. I'M DONE WITH MY 1ST VISIT TO THE SERVICE CENTRE. WHERE THEY'VE BEEN RUDE AND NOT HELPFUL AT ALL.
      
      
      THIS WAS MY FIRST ONLINE SHOPPING AND REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. SO I'LL DEFINITELY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BUYING ANYTHING ONLINE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I HAVE PURCHASED CANVAS TURBO A250, BUT THE MOBILE HAS CORPORATE MAIL CONFIGURATION PROBLEM. THE MAIL WAS GETTING CONFIGURE BUT AFTER FEW TIME INBOX GETTING EMPTY. THE REPLACEMENT PIECE IS ALSO HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I PURCHASED IT ON 10/2/14 SET HANGING CONTINUOSLY DURING VIDEO CALL ON SKYPE,VOICE CALL,USING CAMERA AND APPS NOT RESPONDING MANY TIMES."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I READ MR . PRAVEEN'S REVIEW DATED 01.NOV'13 AND IT HAS HELPED ME IGNORE MICROMAX AND HUGH JACKMAN.ONE WLD THINK THAT 20,000 SHLD GET U DECENT QUALITY AND AFTER SALES SERVICE AND SUPPOTRT. IF U HAVE ENDURED THE FRUSTRATION OF POOR SUPPORT FROM THE MANUFACTURER ONCE UR FAV DEVICE IS DAMAGED, YOU WLD UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN. EVER WONDER Y SO MANY PPL STILL CARRY NOKIA? I AM GOING BACK  TO MY BELOVED NOKIA, COS RELIABILITY HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE WITH THEM AND NEED I SAY ANYTHING ABT THEIR SERVICE CENTERS? I HOPE MMAX WLD SPEND LESS ON ADS AND USE IT FOR KEEPING MOTIVATED AND COMPETENT EMPLOYEES THAT WILL HELP THEIR DISTRAUGHT  CUSTOMERS WHEN THEIR BELOVED PHONE IS ILL.
      
      GOOK LUCK GUYS AND MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS, IT IS UR HARD EARNED MONEY AFTER ALL....."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I RECEIVED CANVAS TURBO FROM FLIPKART WHICH IS GETTING HEAT WHEN CHARGING AND TALKING FOR 5 MIN ALSO. I REQUESTED FOR REPLACEMENT, THE SECOND ITEM WHICH I RECEIVED GIVING MORE PROBLEMS THAN FIRST ONE. TOUCH IS NOT WORKING AND PHONE HEAT PROBLEM.
      
      
      I THINK THESE SELLERS SENDING DAMAGED OR SECOND HAND PRODUCTS WHICH ARE HAVING PROBLEMS.
      
      I DON'T KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO HAS GIVEN REVIEW SAYING VERY GOOD PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART WHICH IS NOT AT ALL TRUE.
      
      
      BE AWARE FROM FLIPKART AND TAKE ORIGINAL PRODUCTS FROM OTHER SELLERS OR SHOP. I AM FACING PROBLEM, AT LEAST I CAN SAVE MANY PEOPLE TO FACE THE SAME."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A DUAL SIM PHONE, CAME ACROSS THIS PHONE, AND ORDERED THIS ONE LOOKING AT THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS (FULL HD SCREEN ATTRACTED ME A LOT). I PLACED THE ORDER, EVEN I DOUBT THE BRAND VALUE THE PHONE IS GOING TO GIVE ME AND AFTER SALES SERVICE. AFTER ORDERING, I KNEW THAT THE SIM IS A DUAL STAND-BY AND NOT A DUAL ACTIVE ONE. THIS IS A SERIOUS DRAWBACK FOR THE GUYS LIKE ME, WHO ARE MUCH SERIOUSLY INTO THEIR PROFESSION, SINCE THIS DUAL STANDBY DOESN'T LET THE USER KNOW WHICH VALUABLE CALL HE IS GOING TO GET ON THE OTHER SIM, WHEN HE IS ON CALL ON ONE SIM. THUS, THIS DUAL STANDBY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME OTHER THAN BEING EQUIVALENT TO A SINGLE SIM. I THOUGHT OF CONFIRMING THIS, I TRIED TO CALL THE CUSTOMER CARE OF MICROMAX (GIVEN IN THEIR WEBSITE), AND THE ONLY THING I COULD HEAR IS ""THE NUMBER YOU ARE CALLING IS NOT VALID"". THIS EXPERIENCE STRENGTHENED MY FEELING OF A VERY BAD AFTER SALES SERVICE I'M GOING TO GET. HENCE, I SIMPLY CANCELLED THE ORDER, AND PLACED AN ORDER FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY-S4, WHERE I'M GETTING A FAR BEYOND PRODUCT IN TERMS OF QUALITY WITH THE SIMILAR SPECIFICATIONS, AND A VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE. IF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS GOOD I WOULD HAVE STUCK TO THIS MICROMAX TURBO A250."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"I WILL NOT RECOMEND THIS TO ANY BODY DUE TO VERY, VERY POOR BATTERY BACK UP,HARDLY ONE HOUR ONLY WORKING"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"IT IS NOT GOOD PHONE AT ALL. I SOLD MY XOLO Q700 FOR THIS PHONE WHICH WAS 10 TIMES BETTER THAN THIS TURBO.CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT EVEN GOOD AS 5MP CAMERA. HANGS EVERY TIME.
      
      
      AFTER JUST 10 DAYS, WHILE PLAYING FIFA 14 IT STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY. TOUCH NOT WORKING, CANT RESTART PHONE, TRIED ALL POSSIBLE THINGS, BUT NOT WORKING.
      
      
      PLEASE THINK BEFORE BUY. THERE SHOULD BE NEGATIVE RATING.-5"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"ITS NOT EVEN 15DAYS I STARTED USING MICRO MAX TURBO A250 PHONE, PHONE SCREEN GETS BLANK N WILL NOT COME FOR NEXT 15 MINS, THE SAME HAPPENS 4 - 5 TIMES IN A DAY."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"JUST BOUGHT A MMX PHONE BUT AFTER 2 DAYS OF USE CHARGING OF BATTERY ABRUPTLY END AND AFTER 24 HRS OF CHARGING BATTERY SHOWS AS 5% CHARGE,I TAKE IT TO SERVICE CENTRE.WHERE THEY TOOK MY PHONE AFTER 20 DAYS I AM YET TO GET MY PHONE BACK AND WHAT I NOTICES THAT AROUND 50 PEOPLE WERE THERE AND ALL HAD THAT SAME PROBLEM.
      
      I HAD VERY MUCH EXPECTATIONS FROM MMX BUT UNFORTUNATELY DISSATISFIED GREATLY DUE TO PHONE AND ITS SERVICE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"MICROMAX - A COMPANY WITH NO VALUE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
      
      YOU MAY BE A VERY CLEAR WHEN YOU WILL BE READING THIS POST COMPLETELY.I PURCHASED A HANDSET OF  MICROMAX ON 21ST JUNE 2013 IMEI NO 0911312401565756 &AMP; 0911312401565764.AND WITHIN 10 DAYS OF PURCHASE THE HANDSET HAD A PROBLEM OF SCREEN DISPLAY MEANING THEREBY ?COMPLETE WHITE SCREEN PERMANENTLY? .I WAS NEITHER ABLE TO CALL ANYBODY NOR EVEN SEE WHO IS CALLING ME.
      
      I WENT TO MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER IN MEERUT (UTTAR PRADESH) NAMED SHREE JEE COMMUNICATION AND SUBMITTED MY HANDSET FOR REPAIR IN AUGUST .I KEPT ON PURSUING THE SERVICE CENTER SINCE AUGUST. I WAS TOLD THAT MY HANDSET COULD NOT BE REPAIRED IN MEERUT IN WANT OF SOME PARTS AND IS BEING SENT TO CORPORATE CENTER IN GURGAON &AMP; WILL HAVE TO WAIT. ON 10TH OCT 2014 WHEN I APPROACHED THE MICROMAX  SERVICE CENTER AGAIN I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD BE PROVIDED WITH NEW HANDSET IN LIEU OF THE DAMAGED ONE AS THE SET COULD NOT BE REPAIRED. I WILL AGAIN HAVE TO WAIT FOR FEW MORE DAYS. THE SERVICE CENTER NOW PROVIDED ME WITH NEW JOB SHEET  ?NUMBER N04059409135420660?STATING THAT ITS FOR THE NEW HANDSET I WOULD GET IN LIEU OF THE DAMAGED ONE. ALL THIS DURATION  I HAD BEEN COORDINATING WITH THE CORPORATE CENTER IN GURGAON AS WELL. MY COMPLAINT NUMBER QUOTED BY THEM IS MMX1810133284.IN AROUND SEPTEMBER ONE OF THEIR EXECUTIVE NAMED MR. MANISH ASSURED ME OF THEIR SERVICES AND SAID EITHER MY SET WOULD BE REPAIRED OR WOULD BE REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE. FEELING HELPLESS WITHOUT ANY HANDSET I EVEN ASKED HIM IF THE SAME HANDSET WAS NOT AVAILABLE I WOULD BE READY TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE AMOUNT ON THE HIGHER VERSION ON THE SAME.
      
      BUT YOU ALL MAY BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT TILL DATE TODAY ON 9TH JAN 2014 SINCE AUGUST 2013 I HAVE NEITHER  GOT MY HANDSET REPAIRED OR REPLACED .
      
      YOU MAY BE MUCH MORE ASTONISHED TO KNOW THAT AFTER WAITING FOR SO LONG AND GETTING NO RESPONSE FROM MICROMAX  I THOUGHT OF TAKING SUPPORT OF LAW. THROUGH AN ADVOCATE I HAD SENT A NOTICE TO MICROMAX AND THE MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER IN MEERUT ASKING AN UPDATE ON MY HANDSET. ITS ALMOST A MONTH NOW THEY HAVE NOT REVERTED ON THE SAME.
      
      NOW AFTER I UNDERWENT THIS ALL, I PERSONALLY FEEL MICROMAX MUST HAVE BEING DOING THE SAME TO OTHER CUSTOMERS AS WELL. ?CHEATING ALL WITH FAKE PRODUCTS AND FAKE COMMITMENTS ON SERVICES?.
      
      THROUGH THIS POST I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ADVICES ON THE SAME AND BEWARE YOU NOT TO FALL INTO THE TRAP OF FAKE COMMITMENTS OF MICROMAX IN FUTURE THROUGH THEIR PRODUCTS.
      
      YOU MAY CALL ME UP ON 09675501784 AND MAY EVEN LISTEN TO THE ENTIRE CONVERSATIONS MADE BETWEEN ME &AMP; THE MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER IN MEERUT AND GURGAON .
      
      MY SINCERE ADVICES FOR YOU ALL -?DO NOT DUMP YOUR MONEY ON PRODUCTS THROUGH A COMPANY (MICROMAX) WHO DOES NOT HAVE VALUE OF CUSTOMERS &AMP; BELIEVES IN CHEATING THEM.
      
      I HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY ACTION FROM THE COMPANY ANYMORE. FIND MY MONEY BEING BEEN WASTED BUT WILL TRY COMMUNICATING &AMP; ADVISING MAXIMUM PEOPLE THROUGH MY POSTS WILLING TO PURCHASE ANY PRODUCT THROUGH THIS COMPANY"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"MOB GETS HANGED FREQUENTLY EVEN WITH 2GB RAM AND LEAST NO:OF APPS INSTALLED. ALSO THE PRICE AS DRASTICALLY REDUCED AFTER MY PURCHASE, WHICH IS CREATING AN IMPRESSION THAT THIS MODEL IS NOT WORTHY OF COST."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"NEXUS 4 IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS........BETTER PROCESSOR,BETTER DESIGN, JUST 3K MORE.......WHY SHOULD I PAY THIS CRAP BRAND 20K WITHOUT ANY PROMISE ON THE AFTERSALE SERVICE..............SERIOUSLY THE GUYZZ LIKING THIS PHONE ARE THE BIGGEST DUMBASS HERE.........ITS GIVING A MEDIATEK PROCESSOR WHILE WE GET A QUALCOMM PROCESSOR WITH NEXUS 4"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"NOT GOOD MOBILE BECAUSE THIS PHONE HAVING INBUILD BATTERY BECAUSE OF THIS PHONE HANG CONDTION,ONLY ONE OPTION LEFT TO GO TO SERVICE CENTRE BUT OTHER PHONES HAVING OTHER OPTION IN CASE OF INBUILD BATTERY,THEY PROVIDE ALL BUTTONS PUSH AND HOLD YOUR PHONE AUTOMATICALLY RESET BUT IN MICROMAX THIS OPTION IS NOT AVIALABLE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"PLEASE DON'T GO FOR THIS PHONE AS IT SEEMS A FIRST-RATE OPTION AT THIS PRICE RANGE ,BUT IT MAY STOP WORKING AT ANY TIME .I AM FEELING VERY LOW AS WITH IN A WEEK'S TIME MY PHONE GONE OUT OF ORDER TWICE AND I HAD TO OPT FOR REPLACEMENT ....
      
      
      THINK THRICE  BEFORE OPTING FOR MICROMAX AS U WILL HAVE  ANYTHING WHICH WILL BE NOTHING ..."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"PLEASE GUYS SERIOUSLY I RECOMMEND YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT MOTO G AND COME BACK TO THIS UGLY DUCKLING.CAZ MOTO G IS EVERY WAY IS BETTER THAN MICROMAX( ASSEMBLED PHONE MAKER,WHIT CHINESE GOODS) !!! .
      
      
      COMPARO OF MICROMAX TURBO AND MOTO G
      
      
      PROS
      
      
      CAMERA :MOTO' DAMN BETTER THAN TURBO (13 MP THEY SAY BUT IT IS NOT LIKE THAT)
      
      
      UI:MAN IT IS THE BEST .MICROMAX IS GENERATIONS BEHIND TOOO BASIC
      
      
      APPEARENCE: CRAZY LOOKS ON ONE ANGLE IT LOOKS LIKE I PHONE
      
      
      SCREEN: MICROMAX THEY CLAIM THE BEST BUT WHEN U COMPARE IT WITH MOTO U WILL SAY THE ANSWER

      5 STAR FOR MOTO G
      
      
      1 STAR FOR MICROMAX CANVAS TURBO"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,SOME PEOPLE SAY IT DOESN'T HAVE EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD SLOT. YES THAT'S CORRECT BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT GALAXY S4 AND ALL THE IPHONES TOO DON'T HAVE MEMORY CARD SLOTS. IT'S THE IDEA OF MMX TO OFFER A PHONE WITH THE SAME FEATURE AS OTHER BRANDED PHONES ARE OFFERING. ALSO NOTE THAT PRICE IS LESS AND QUALITY IS MUCH BETTER THEN OTHERS. I HAVE PERSONALLY USED THE PHONE AND I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT N QUALITY. PEOPLE WHO ARE DUMB DON'T FIND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MMX WITH SAMSUNG AND IPHONE. IF YOU BUY IPHONE OR S4 THEN YOU'LL REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MMX. GIVING 1 SO IT'S POSTED ON THE RIGHT PLACE.
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"THE KEEPS RESTARTING ITSELF.
      
      IT HAS SOME SOFTWARE PROBLEM WHICH I AM UNABLE TO DEAL WITH. MOREOVER THE CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT UPTO THE MARK."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"THE MOST USELESS PRODUCT I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS. DON'T BUY THE PHONE A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.... THE STANDARD OF THIS PHONE IS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR A SMART PHONE. IN 2 DAYS WHAT I HAVE USED IT, I HAVE RESET IT 2 TIMES. NETWORK KEEPS DROPPING. SAME SIM CARD ON MY OTHER PHONE WORKS WELL. A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE AND IF FLIPKART DOESN'T REFUND I WILL FILE A COMPLAINT FROM MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY AS THIS IS IN AN EMI BASIS. HORRIBLE. I WANT TO WRITE MORE BUT LACK OF TIME."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"THIS IS REGARDING MY ORDER OF MICROMAX CANVAUS TURBO A250 FROM FLIPKART ON 20TH  DEC 2013 @18 THOUSAND .
      
      
      WITH IN THE 30 DAYS OF MY PURCHASE THE TOUCH OF THIS PHONE STOPPED WORKING. WHEN CONTACTED FLIPKART THEY SIMPLY REFUSED TO HELP ME OUT AND STATED THAT YOU NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH MICROMAX CUSTOMER CARE FOR ITS RESOLUTION.
      
      
      WHEN I HAD REACHED THE MICROMAX SERVICE CENTER  ON 13TH JAN 2014 AT VASISHTA COMPLEX, SIKANDERPUR - 122002 , THEY SIMPLY REFUSED TO TAKE THE PHONE AND SAID OUR SYSTEMS ARE NOT WORKING . PLEASE COMEBACK LATER.
      
      
      WHEN I HAD VISITED THEIR ANOTHER SERVICE CENTER , AFTER WAITING FOR FULL ONE HOUR THEY SAID THEY DONT HAVE THE PARTS OF THE THIS PHONE AND I CAN EITHER VISIT ANOTHER STORE OR LEAVE MY PHONE WITH THEM AND THEY WILL SEE IF THEY CAN ARRANGE FOR THE PART IN THE NEXT 7-10 DAYS.
      
      I CONSISTENTLY ASKED FOR THE SERVICE CENTER WHEN THEY SERVICE THIS HANDSET , THEY SAID THEY CANT COMMENT ON IT.
      
      
      OVERALL WORST EXPERIENCE WITH MICROMAX SERVICE AS WELL THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      WHEN SEARCHED A MORE ABOUT MICROMAX OVER NET , I GOT A FEELING THAT IT NOT JUST ME WHO HAS BAD EXPERIENCE WITH MICROMAX PRODUCT BUT THEY ARE MANY MORE LIKE ME .  STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO GIVE  A TRY TO MICROMAX PRODUCT.
      
      
      HEMANT RAI JAIN"
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"THIS PRODUCT IS TOTALLY WASTAGE OF MONEY. I NEVER WANTED TO PURCHASE SET WITH MICRO SIM AND NON REMOVABLE BATTERY. NO WHERE THIS INFORMATION WAS WRITTEN ON FLIPKART SPECIFICATION. I GOT TWO TIME DISPLAY PROBLEM IN MY SET . DISPLAY WAS TOTALLY BLANK ALTHOUGH PHONE WAS RUNNING IN BACKGROUND. I ASKED FOR REPLACEMENT AND I GOT THE NEW PRODUCT. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SITUATION IF I GET THE SAME PROBLEM AFTER 30 DAYS BECAUSE FLIPKART CAN'T REPLACE THE PRODUCT AFTER 30 DAYS. AND IT IS VERY KNOWN MICROMAX CUSTOMER SERVICE IS PATHETIC. GUYS BEFORE PURCHASE THIS SET MAKE SURE IF YOU MOBILE HANGS YOU CAN'T CORRECT IT BY OWN AS BATTERY IS NON REMOVABLE. ALWAYS CHOOSE A RELIABLE BRAND. THIS KIND OF SET LOOK VERY ATTRACTIVE BUT NEVER STANDS LONGER. YOU MAY GO FOR MORE RELIABLE BRAND LIKE SAMSUNG AND SONY , NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE BUT VERY RELIABLE."
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,THIS WAS MY FIRST PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART. WAS HAPPY THAT ONLY ON FLIPKART GOT THE EMI OPTION FOR MY BANKER. BUT THE CHEER ENDED WHEN I OPENED THE BOX WHERE IN WHICH OUTER BOX WAS SEALED BY THE MERCHANT BUT ORIGINAL PACKING FROM MANUFACTURER WAS TAMPERED. IT LOOKED EITHER SECOND QUALITY SALE FROM FACTORY OUTLET OR A CLEARANCE SALE FROM MERCHANT. THE CHARGER WAS CLEARLY A USED ONE. FELT LITTLE BAD FOR PAYING FULL AMOUNT + INTEREST FOR EMI + INTEREST ON MY CREDIT CARD FOR SUCH A PIECE.
Micromax Canvas Turbo A250,1,"WITH IN 3 MONTHS OF PURCHASE, THE MOBILE WENT TO HOSPITAL.
      
      MICROMAX HAS TO IMPROVE THE AFTER SALE SERVICE DRASTICALLY TO SURVIVE IN THE MARKET.
      
      TOTALLY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT AS WELL AS WITH THE SERVICE."
Moto G,5,"A BIG KUDOS TO FLIPKART, SINCE THEY HAVE MENTIONED 10-20 DAYS I HAVE RECEIVED IN 5 DAYS, A BIG CLAP FOR THAT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL. NOW ABOUT THE PHONE, NO DOUBT, ITS AWSOME, LOVED THE FEATURES, CAMERA ALL. RECOMMEND ANY 1 WHO WANTS TO FOR IT."
Moto G,5,"A LITTLE LATE I AM TO REVIEW BUT ALL IS WELL :P :D. FOA, THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING MY ORDERED PRODUCT ON A KIND REQUEST AND ASAP. I WAS VERY MUCH DELIGHTED TO SEE IT IN A SWISH DELIVERY. ILL GIVE U 5 OF 5 FOR THAT.
      
      NOW THE PRODUCT - MOTO G. THE MUCH ANTICIPATED BUDGET CUM MUCH SMARTER MOBILE. IT HAS REALLY TRIGGERED SONY TO LEVEL HIS PEOPLES TO DESIGN NEW VARIANT THAT CAN COMPETE MOTO G. AND I WOULD SAY IT WOULDNT STAND A CHANCE.
      
      INITIALLY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS , IT WAS HARD TO SETTLE WITH SMARTPHONE PROVIDING THE FACT ITS MY FIRST SMARTPHONE. THEN TODAY I HAVE UPGRADED TO KITKAT VERSION AND ITS SOOOOOO NICE.
      
      NO STRUGGLE NO LOSS NO LAG... ITS A NO NO PHONE AND ONE THING I FAILED WITH MOTO G IS THAT I COULDNT DRAIN OUT THE BATTERY NOT LESS THAN 40 HOURS.
      
      *THE BEST PART, I DOWNLOADED ASPHALT 8 AIRBORNE THROUGH WIFI IN 25 GRACE MINUTES WITH THE BATTERY LEVEL DOWN FROM 28 TO 20%. WHILE I STARTED PLAYIN THE GAME, NO LAG AND BATTERY CHARGE IS CHALLENGING THE APP WITH LONG TIME STANDING.
      
      
      ENOUGH SAID. GRAB YOURS SOON, ELSE U HAVE MISSED THE STOCK VERSION WICH HAS BEST UI THAN CUSTOM.. IT CARES ABOUR UR HEALTH, HEARING LEVEL. WOW!. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MOTOROLA TO MAKE PRODUCT FOR PEOPLE AND NOT TO DRAG PEOPLE INTO THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      BEAR WITH LITTLE MISCOMFORTS IN THE MOBILE. THEY ARE LIKE PARTICLES. WITH THE CAMERA, ITS THE BEST IN ITS SEGMENT. COMPARED WITH OTHER MOBILES TOO."
Moto G,5,"AFTER SO MUCH OF WAITING I HAVE GOT MY MOTO G FROM MY FAVOURITE ON-LINE RETAILER FLIPKART. (THOUGH SOME PROBLEMS ARE THERE WITH SHIPPING OF MOTO G, I STILL PREFER FLIPKART). FIRST OF ALL, WE NEED TO APPRECIATE MOTOROLA FOR THE PACKAGE THAT THEY MADE. HOW THEY HAVE MANAGED SUCH A COMPACT AND SMALL PACKET FOR A PHONE, BATTERY AND HEADSET. I WAS AMAZED BY SEEING THE PACKET.
      
      COMING TO THE PHONE, IT IS VERY GOOD FOR THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND. IPS DISPLAY, GORILLA GLASS3, QUAD CORE PROCESSOR, 1 GB RAM ALL THIS FEATURES ARE LESS THAN 15K (13999 ACTUALLY). THE PHONE THAT YOU ARE GETTING IS MUCH MORE WORTH THAN THE MONEY THAT YOU INVEST,
      
      
      POSITIVES:
      
      1. DISPLAY: IT IS HAVING IPS DISPLAY WITH 1280X720 RESOLUTION. CLARITY IS TOP NOTCH.
      
      2. GORILLA GLASS : PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SECURITY TO DISPLAY.
      
      3. PROCESSOR AND RAM : QUAD CORE SNAPDRAGON 400 (1.2 GHZ) WITH 1 GB RAM, WE CAN PLAY SOME HIGH END GAMES WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.
      
      4. BATTERY: IF YOU CONTINUOUSLY SWITCH TO 2G AND IF WE DO SIMPLE BROWSING AND PLAYING SIMPLE GAMES LIKE CANDY CRUSH WE CAN GET UPTO 24-26 HOURS. I HAVE NOT TESTED WITH A 3G CONNECTION.
      
      
      NEGATIVES:
      
      1. RARE CAMERA: IT IS 5MP WITH 720P VIDEO RECORDING. DAY TIME YOU WILL GET IMAGES WITH FINE CLARITY, BUT NIGHT TIME THE CLARITY OF IMAGES IS NOT GOOD (THOUGH IT IS IN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL).
      
      2. NO SUPPORT FOR EXPANDABLE MEMORY: IT IS COMING WITH 8GB/16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR EXTENDING IT. BETTER GO FOR 16GB (USAGE MEMORY WILL BE AROUND 12.5 GB). BUT AFTER KITKAT UPDATE, YOU CAN DIRECTLY CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO ANY PEN DRIVE THROUGH A OTG CABLE WITHOUT ANY THIRD PARTY APP. THEREFORE, YOU CAN PUT ALL YOUR ADDITIONAL DATA IN A PEN DRIVE AND WE CAN CARRY WITH A OTG CABLE.
      
      
      SOME GLITCHES AFTER KITKAT UPDATE:
      
      
      1. I DONT KNOW WHY SOMETIMES IT IS NOT GETTING CONNECTED TO YOUR LAPTOP OR DESKTOP WITH A DATA CABLE. BEFORE KITKAT UPDATE, THERE WAS NO PROBLEM, AFTER UPDATE IF YOU WANT TO CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO A LAPTOP YOU NEED TO RESTART YOUR PHONE.
      
      2. IF YOU ARE USING 2 SIMS, THERE IS SOME PROBLEM IN INCOMING CALLS, SOMETIMES YOU CANNOT RECEIVE CALLS THOUGH YOU HAVE PROPER SIGNAL STRENGTH (THIS I HAVE NOT OBSERVED IN MY PHONE AS I AM USING ONE SIM ONLY BUT I OBSERVED IT IN MY FRIEND'S PHONE)
      
      3. SOME SYSTEMS WIDGETS ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY AFTER KITKAT UPDATE (LIKE AUTO ROTATION OPTION ON SYSTEM WIDGET ETC.)
      
      4. WHEN YOU RESTART YOUR MOBILE, AUTO SYNC OPTION FOR GMAIL IS CHANGING TO NO SYNC OPTION BY DEFAULT (THIS I OBSERVED SOME TIMES)
      
      
      HOPE MOTOROLA MAY RELEASE SOME PATCH FOR THE ABOVE GLITCHES.
      
      
      OVERALL, THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD AND BETTER GO FOR 16GB VERSION FOR NO REGRETS."
Moto G,5,"ALWAYS HAD IN MIND THAT I WILL NEVER BUY ANY ANDROID PHONE AS ONLY REASON WAS SAMSUNG LITERALLY SCREWED THE ANDROID BY MAKING IT MUCH SLOWER THAN THE ACTUAL ANDROID OS. BUT WHEN I FOUND MOTOROLA WITH UNADULTERATED OS WITHOUT ANY CUSTOMISATION IT SOUNDED AMAZING TO ME. SERIOUSLY IT IS AN AMAZING PHONE I USED AFTER IPHONE. JUST GOT MY FIRST ANDROID AND I AM ENJOYING FROM THE VERY MOMENT I RECIEVED IT.
      
      ABOUT FLIPKART...NO WORDS AS IT ALWAYS GIVES YOU AN AMAZING FASTER DELIVERY."
Moto G,5,"AN EXCELLENT DEVICE. YOU MAY BUY THIS WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT. I USUALLY RESEARCH AND WINDOW-SHOP FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST PHONE I'VE PURCHASED ON AN IMPULSE!
      
      
      EVEN WHEN I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION OF BUYING THE MOTO G, I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WENT OUT OF STOCK SO SOON ON THE LAUNCH DAY! I HAPPENED TO NOTICE IT BACK IN STOCK IN THE AFTERNOON, BUT WAS ABLE TO GET ONLY THE 8GB (~5.5GB USABLE). I WAS INITIALLY NOT VERY CONVINCED WITH THE INTERNAL STORAGE AND THOUGHT I'LL EVENTUALLY CANCEL THE ORDER AND WAIT FOR THE 16GB, BUT I HELD ON, SECRETLY WISHING FOR A 100% CASH BACK AMONGST OTHER GOODIES. I HOWEVER GOT THE OTHER LAUNCH DAY OFFERS FOR CLOTHING AND E-BOOKS, AND PURCHASED A ROYAL BLUE BACK COVER FOR RS.270.
      
      
      THE PURE ANDROID OS IS SLICK AND SNAPPY, SHOWING NO SIGNS OF ANY LAG WHATSOEVER, AND IS ACTUALLY ADDICTIVE TO THE POINT WHERE I SOMETIMES SWITCH ON THE DISPLAY JUST TO TOGGLE THROUGH THE HOMESCREENS AND LAUNCHER! THE EXPERIENCE IS SIMPLY SUPERB!
      
      
      AFTER TWO WEEKS OF USAGE, I HAVE ALL BUT FORGOTTEN THAT I DO NOT HAVE MUCH INTERNAL STORAGE LEFT. THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED PIECE! I AM PRETTY SURE I'LL MOVE ALL PHOTOS TO THE 65GB GOOGLE DRIVE, KEEP ~2GB OF MP3S, AND SMALL GAMES. I USE THE PHONE MOSTLY FOR BROWSING, TEXTING, SOCIAL NETWORKING, LIGHT GAMING, PHONE CALLS, YOUTUBE, SKYPE, VIBER ETC,. I DO NOT MIND THE NON-EXPANDABLE INTERNAL STORAGE, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE A MICRO SD SLOT.
      
      
      THE JELLYBEAN INSTALL HAD A SMALL BUG WITH THE VOLUME CONTROL. IT WOULD REMAIN LOW TILL ABOUT 90% AND THEN GET VERY LOUD IN THE LAST 10% OR SO. THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED POST INSTALLING KITKAT, AND THE VOLUME INCREASE IS NOW GRADUAL.
      
      
      AFTER I UPGRADED TO KITKAT, THE BATTERY DROPPED FROM 62% TO 42% AFTER THE INITIAL REBOOT! THE BACKUP SEEMS TO HAVE STABILISED AFTER A FACTORY RESET AND A FEW DAYS OF USAGE, AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN AN 'ALL DAY BATTERY'.
      
      
      MOUNTING STORAGE THROUGH OTG REPORTEDLY WORKS WELL ON THE INDIAN MOTO G WITH 4.4.2, AS DEMONSTRATED BY USER 'GEEKYRANJIT' ON HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL. I HAVEN'T TRIED THIS YET, BUT I AM PLANNING TO BUY A CABLE OR AN OTG PEN DRIVE.
      
      
      THE HD DISPLAY IS CRISP AND STUNNING. YOU WILL WANT TO WATCH MOVIES ON THIS THING! WATCHING HD VIDEOS FROM YOUTUBE IS MIND BLOWING, BUT I DO THIS ONLY WHILE ON WIFI AS THE DATA USAGE IS HEAVY FOR SUCH CONTENT. SMALL TEXT IS LEGIBLE AND VERY CLEAR. CORNING GORILLA GLASS 3 IS VERY THIN, SO THE SCREEN IS ALMOST CLOSE TO THE GLASS, MAKING IT ALL THE MORE BEAUTIFUL!
      
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY IS GREAT AND THE PHONE FEELS VERY PREMIUM! THE PHONE FEELS SLIM AND SUFFICIENTLY WEIGHTED AND IT LITERALLY SLIPS INTO THE POCKET. THE VOLUME AND POWER BUTTONS RATTLE A BIT, BUT PROVIDE NICE TACTILE FEEDBACK. THE BACK COVER IS DIFFICULT TO TAKE OFF, BUT THERE IS A ONE MINUTE VIDEO BY USER 'HIMESH123456789' ON YOUTUBE THAT DEMOSTRATES HOW TO DO THIS EASILY.
      
      
      THE NON REMOVABLE BATTERY IS FINE. DUE TO LONG BACKUP, EXPECT LESSER CHARGING CYCLES AND HENCE LONGER BATTERY LIFE. KEEP THE PHONE CHARGED AT 45-90% WITH REGULAR TOP-UPS TO PROLONG ITS LIFE. NEVER DEEP CYCLE (0-100%) YOUR SMARTPHONE BATTERY OFTEN, EXCEPT WHEN THERE IS A NEED TO CALIBRATE, AS DOING SO WILL REDUCE ITS SERVICE LIFE. THERE IS NO 'MEMORY EFFECT', SO YOU CAN CHARGE AT RANDOM.
      
      
      THE CAMERA ISN'T THE BEST, BUT IT DOES THE JOB. THE SECONDARY CAM IS DECENT. THE LED BULB IS VERY BRIGHT AND LIGHTS UP A FAIRLY LARGE AREA.
      
      
      THE LOUDSPEAKER IS VERY SHRILL, AND EXTREMELY LOUD! THIS IS IMPORTANT IN NOISY ENVIRONMENTS WHERE ONE CAN MISS HEARING A RINGTONE. MUSIC IS SURPRISINGLY CRISP AND THE TINIEST OF DETAILS ARE AUDIBLE.THE TREBLE IS EXTREME, BUT THE BASS IS LOW. ONE SHOULD REFRAIN FROM KEEPING THE VOLUME AT 100% WHILE PLAYING MEDIA, AS THE SPEAKER TENDS TO CRACKLE AND DISTORT. 95% IS THE SWEET SPOT FOR CLEAN MAXIMUM VOLUME. AUDIO QUALITY THROUGH HEADPHONES IS ALRIGHT.
      
      
      CALL QUALITY IS NICE. VOICE IS CLEAR AND RECEPTION IS NEAT. THE EARPIECE IS SUFFICIENTLY LOUD. WIFI AND 3G CONNECTIVITY IS GOOD AND I HAVEN'T FACED ANY CONNECTION DROPS TILL NOW. THE BROWSING EXPERIENCE IS SMOOTH. KINETIC SCROLLING AND ZOOM WORK PERFECTLY.
      
      
      THE BUNDLED ACCESSORIES AREN'T OF THE BEST QUALITY AND THE HEADPHONES JUST ADD UP TO THE PILE OF UNUSED WIRED HANDS-FREE DEVICES LYING AROUND SINCE THE FIRST NOKIA DAYS. THE ALL WHITE CHARGER LOOKS NEAT BUT COMES WITH AN AWKWARD LOOKING TWO PIN, LIKE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A HURRY FOR THE INDIAN RETAIL PACKAGING. I WOULD'VE PERSONALLY PREFERRED TO HAVE THE STANDALONE USB CABLE LIKE THE ONE BUNDLED WITH THE US VERSION, BUT I ALREADY HAVE A TOUGH SONY ERICSSON CABLE AND CHARGER THAT CAME WITH THE ST15I. A MICRO USB WALL CHARGER IS HOWEVER A WELCOME ADDITION TO THE COLLECTION IN SOME WAYS, SO ONE CAN BE KEPT PLUGGED IN AT HOME, ONE IN OFFICE, ONE IN THE TRAVEL BAG, ETC,.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, A NICE PACKAGE! A PURCHASE THAT WOULD BRING YOU UP TO DATE WITH THE FLAGSHIP SMARTPHONE EXPERIENCE, FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE."
Moto G,5,"AWESOME FOR BEST PRICE.................
      
      GOOD DESIGN ...........
      
      TOUCH ULTIMATE............
      
      LOVING IT..........."
Moto G,5,"BOOKED MOTO G ON 24TH AT 8:30 PM WHEN THERE WAS NO STOCK, GOT THE DEVICE ON 26TH NOON ! IMPRESSED.. FLIPKART, YOU'RE AWESOME ! :) :)"
Moto G,5,"BROUGHT 3 MOTO G'S WH WAS DELIVERED WITHIN 4TO5 DAYS TIME ...SO U CAN GUESS ABT THE PRODUCT N SERVICE...FULL A+ RATING FR U FLIPKART,,,"
Moto G,5,"BUILT IS GOOD.
      
      SCREEN IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN 1.5 DAYS.
      
      WITH STOCK ROM IT CONSUMES MINIMUM AMOUNT OF RAM.
      
      AND WITH ADRENO 305 APPROX ALL GAMES ARE EASILY PLAYED AND GRAPHICS IS NO DOUBTEDLY ENHANCED.
      
      IT BOOTS FASTER AND VOICE QUALITY OF SPEAKERS ARE GOOD,NO DOUBT IF YOU WILL MAXIMIZE IT , SOUND  WILL START TO BREAKDOWN.
      
      WITH NOVA LAUNCHER WE CAN CUSTOMIZE THE UI ON KITKAT OS.
      
      ONE THING WHAT I AM CONCERN IS THAT I AM UNABLE TO GET ACCESSORIES OF MOTOROLA FOR MOTO G.
      
      I NEED FLIP COVER FOR THIS MOBILE.IT HAS BEEN AROUND 20-21 DAYS, STILL WAITING FOR IT."
Moto G,5,"BUILT QUALITY IS GOOD EVERY THING GOOD   .....................................................................
      
      
      BUT HOW TO  VIDEO CALL THROUGH 3G NETWORK???????????????????????"
Moto G,5,"EXTREMELY A KILLER FONE FOR THE PRICE.
      
      I GOT IT 2 DAYS BEFORE ASSURED DATE OF DELIVERY.
      
      FOR THIS PRICE YOU CANNOT GET A BETTER PHONE.
      
      MORE THAN WHAT YOU GET IN THIS PHONE, WHAT YOU DO NOT GET HERE WOULD BE MORE RELEVANT.
      
      1. CAMERA IS GOOD ONLY IN FULL BRIGHT LIGHT AND REALLY BAD IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS.
      
      2. MEMORY IS 1GB RAM AND 8/16 GB NON-EXPANDABLE. SO YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE ALL YOUR FOTOS, MUSIC ETC REDUNDANTLY.
      
      3. SPEAKER PHONE IS NOT THAT GREAT, SO IF YOU ARE AVID USER OF SPEAKER FONE, THINK TWICE.
      
      4. BATTERIES ARE FIXED, SO IF YOU HAVE HABIT OF INSTALLING ALL CRAP APPS AND YOUR PHONE HANGS FREQUENTLY. BE CAREFUL WITH FIXED BATTERY PHONES, WHEN YOUR PHONE HANGS YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESTART BY REMOVING THE BATTERIES AND MUST JUST WAIT PATIENTLY.
      
      
      APART FROM ABOVE,
      
      1. BATTERY LASTS FOR WHOLE DAY &AMP; MORE FOR AVG TALK TIME, AVG WIFI USE (FOR MAILS &AMP; MESSAGES ) NOT FOR STREAMING AND HEAVY DOWNLOADS.
      
      2. THERES AN OPTION TO ENABLE AND DISABLE THE SIM YOU WISH TO USE FOR DATA TRANSFER &AMP; YOU CAN SET LIMIT FOR THE SAME. SO YOU GET WARNING IF YOU CROSS THE LIMIT. YOU CAN USE 2G OR 3G CONNECTION OPTIONALLY. THIS IS GREAT WHEN YOU HAVE LIMITED 3G PLAN AND UNLIMITED 2G PLAN.
      
      3. 4.3 KITKAT UPGRADE IS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND UI CHANGES ARE VERY GOOD.
      
      4. DISPLAY QUALITY IS EXTREMELY GOOD.
      
      5. DEFAULT AVAILABILITY OF SENDING SMS WHEN YOU CUT CALL IS EXTREMELY USEFUL AND INTUTIVE.
      
      6. I'M FROM TRICHY, A TIER 2 CITY IN TAMILNADU. I WAS WONDERING, HOW WILL MY SERVICING OF PHONE BE TAKEN CARE. SURPRISINGLY, I WAS SENT WITH THE BILL, AN ADDRESS OF LOCAL SERVICE POINT IN TRICHY. I HARDLY DOUBT ABOUT THE NEED FOR SUCH A SERVICE POINT, FOR THE PHONE SEEMS TO BE VERY GOOD.
      
      7. CLEAN MASTER IS ONE INCREDIBLE FREE APP WHICH WILL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR MAKING RAM FREE, WITH LEAST EFFORT.
      
      
      I'M NOT A GAMER SO I CANT SAY MUCH ABOUT SPEED AND RESPONSE. AS SUCH FOR ALL BASIC OPERATIONS, THE FONE WORKS LIKE A CHARM."
Moto G,5,"FIRST OF, THANKS FLIPKART FOR PROVIDING THE BEST COMMON MAN'S ANDROID PHONE AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE. THE PHONE ITSELF IS QUITE EXCEPTIONAL IF YOU STAY WITHIN THE RANGE OF DAILY USAGE, SUCH AS PHONE CALLS, MESSAGING, WHATSAPP, LIGHT GAMING. THE HD SCREEN LOOKS GREAT AT 4.5"". THE 326 PPI IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
      
      
      ALONG WITH THAT, THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING MY PHONE(S) WITHIN 6 DAYS, EVEN WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK. I READ SOME PREVIOUS REVIEW ABOUT A HUGE DELAYED DELIVERY.
      
      
      OVERALL, GOOD PHONE, ALMOST NEXUS LIKE."
Moto G,5,"FRANKLY ... MOTO G IS A SUPERB PHONE. I RECEIVED MY MOTO G ON FEB 20TH WHERE AS I WAS EXPECTING IT ON 25TH .. ITS BEEN A WEEK NOW THAT I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SO I THOUGHT THAT NOW ITS TIME FOR ME TO PUT MY REVIEW. MOTOROLA MOBILITY IS UNDER GOOGLE NOW, I AM SURE THEY HAVE PUT ALL THEIR EFFORTS TO GET THE BEST OUT OF FACTORY. THE BEST THING IS THAT THE PHONE STANDS ABOVE EXPECTATION IN MOST OF ITS FEATURES.
      
      
      EXCELLENT SCREEN RESOLUTION WITH 329 PPI
      
      COOL DESIGN WITH PREMIUM QUALITY FINISH (I FELL IN LOVE THE MOMENT I GOT IT IN MY HANDS)
      
      TOUCH IS VERY SMOOTH AND RESPONSIVE
      
      DUAL MICRO SIM SLOTS
      
      LAG FREE PERFORMANCE THROUGH OUT.
      
      AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS DEVICE IS OTG ENABLED HOWEVER I HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE TO CHECK IT MYSELF.
      
      LED FLASH IS VERY BRIGHT AND USEFUL WITH CERTAIN FLASH APPS FROM PLAY STORE.
      
      CLEAR SOUND QUALITY WITH VIDEOS AND AUDIOS.
      
      CHOOSE AMONG COLORED BACK COVERS AND FLIP COVERS  (I CHOSE WHITE FLIP COVER WHICH FITS IN FINE)
      
      
      CAMERA - VIDEO &AMP; IMAGE QUALITY IS PRETTY DECENT AS ITS A BUDGET PHONE (COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER IF COMPARED TO NOKIA LUMIA 520 ..)
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS BETTER THAN AVERAGE
      
      KEYPAD USAGE GOT ME FEW ISSUES WHILE TYPING OTHERWISE ITS FINE.
      
      NO MEMORY CARD SLOT BUT 16 GB SERVES ME FINE. (MOREOVER YOU GET 50 GB DRIVE SPACE FOR 2 YEARS AND YOU ALSO HAVE OTG CONNECTIVITY)
      
      
      IF YOU CAN AFFORD TRYING SOMETHING NEW THEN DEFINITELY GO FOR IT. :)"
Moto G,5,GOOD SERVICE. SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. MOTO G IS AN EXCELLENT MOBILE FOR THIS PRICE. VALUE FOR MONEY.
Moto G,5,"GOT IT ONE WEEK AFTER MY ORDER, AWESOME DISPLAY, SMOOTH TOUCH,MUSIC QUALITY AND BATTERY HAS BEEN PRETTY DECENT TILL NOW.GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY SPENT."
Moto G,5,"GOT MORE THAN WHAT I EVER EXPECTED
      
      (THE BUILD, THE CURVE AT THE BACK,THE CORNING COVERING THE FRONT, THE SNAPDRAGON BENEATH, THE KITKAT ""UPGRADE"" WITHIN,AND WHAT A SCREEN AT 4.5INCHES).
      
      HATS OFF TO FLIPKART ,GOT IT WITHIN 48 HRS OF IT'S INDIAN LAUNCH!
      
      
      THE CAMERA(ONLY PRIMARY)IS EXCELLENT IN NATURAL LIGHTING BUT KINDA OK IN LOW-LIGHTING.BUT THE SECONDARY IS AWESOME(GREAT FOR SELFIES).
      
      AND PLZ PEOPLE....YOU DO GET A LIST OF ALL OFFICIAL MOTOROLA REPAIR CENTRES(INDIAN TIE-UPS) IN YOUR CITY AND THE GUARANTEE CARD!
      
      
      AND LASTLY MOTOROLA HAS ALWAYS REDEFINED WHAT""HOTNESS IN TECHNOLOGY""CAN BE(SLIVER,RAZR ,DROID,DEFY....),SO HATS OFF ""MOTO""."
Moto G,5,"GOT THE PHONE IN 1 DAY OF BOOKING.. REALLY AWESOME SERVICE BY FLIPKART..
      
      REGARDING PHONE.. WORTH THE MONEY.. EXCELLENT BUILD.. CANT ASK ANYTHING MORE FOR THAT PRICE..
      
      VERY MUCH SIMILAR TO NEXUS.."
Moto G,5,GREAT PHONE EXCEPT BATTERY GETS HEATED UP QUICKLY. EXCEPT THIS IS A GREAT GREAT GREAT PHONE. THE BATTERY GETS HEATED UP QUCIKLY. I USUALLY KEEP IN MY PANT POCKET AND I'M FEELING LITTLE HEAT THERE!
Moto G,5,"GREAT THING IS PRICE. LESS BUDGET , MORE FEATURES. GREAT SCREEN RESOLUTION. GREAT BETTERY LIFE. NICE LOOK. GOOD PICTURE QUALITY OF CAMERA."
Moto G,5,"GUD PERFORMANCE, SEXY LOOK, MOTO G COVER WITH ALL ADV. LATEST TECH. AT CHEAP RATE WITH OWSOME PERFORMANCE :)"
Moto G,5,HEHE......................AT LAST I GOT IT........................... WORKING PERFECT.................................
Moto G,5,I AM VARY HAPPY WITH MOTO G. AND WS ALSO VARY FAST DELIVER WITH GOOD PACKING................................................................................................................................................................................
Moto G,5,"I BOOKED THE 16GB MODEL ON 22ND FEB, AND HATS OFF TO THE EXCELLENT SERVICE OF FLIPKART I RECEIVED IT ON 24TH FEB. AFTER 2 DAYS OF GOING THROUGH THE PHONE, I AM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THIS DEVICE.
      
      
      PROS:-
      
      BUILD QUALITY AND DESIGN:
      
      SUFFICIENTLY STURDY, THE BACK COVER PROVIDES FOR A NICE GRIP AND AS PER MY OPINION IN THIS PRICE RANGE CAN'T FIND A BETTER LOOKING PHONE.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE:
      
      POWERED WITH A 1.2GHZ QUAD-CORE PROCESSOR, ADRENO 305 GPU AND 1 GB RAM, THIS DEVICE PROVIDES YOU WITH A FAST PERFORMANCE AND HANDLES MULTIPLE APPS WITH EASE.
      
      
      DISPLAY:
      
      NICE RESOLUTION(720P) AND PIXEL DENSITY. EVEN IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE DISPLAY QUITE WELL(BETTER THAN PREMIUM PHONES EG. GALAXY NOTE 2, IPHONE 4S).
      
      
      BATTERY:
      
      2070 MAH BATTERY, I HAVE HAD TO CHARGE MY PHONE JUST ONCE IN THE LAST 2 DAYS (MODERATE USAGE).
      
      
      ANDROID 4.4 KITKAT UPDATE:
      
      YOU CAN UPDATE YOUR MOTOG TO THE LATEST ANDROID 4.4 KITKAT WHICH IS FASTER THAN JELLY BEAN.
      
      
      MOTOROLA MIGRATE:
      
      THIS APP WILL ENABLE PREVIOUS ANDROID USERS TO EASILY TRANSFER THEIR DATA(INCLUDING CONTACTS, CALL LOGS AND MESSAGES) WIRELESSLY TO THIS PHONE.
      
      
      MOTOROLA ASSIST:
      
      IT WILL KEEP THE MOTO G QUIET WHILE YOU'RE IN A MEETING OR SLEEPING.
      
      THE MEETING OPTIONS ARE TO SILENCE THE SMARTPHONE AND TO SEND AUTO-REPLIES.
      
      WHILE THE SLEEPING OPTION LETS YOU CONFIGURE THE TIME INTERVAL, ALLOW CALLS FROM A FAVORITE CONTACT OR LIST OF CONTACTS AND PUT THROUGH CALLS FROM THE SAME PERSON IF THEY CALL TWICE IN THE INTERVAL OF 5 MINUTES.
      
      IT'S A GOOD WAY TO SILENCE ALL THOSE ANNOYING NOTIFICATIONS THAT COME THROUGH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET SOME REST.
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      CAMERA:
      
      QUESTIONABLE CAMERA QUALITY. QUALITY OF DAYLIGHT PHOTOS ARE BETTER THAN THE ONES CLICKED AT NIGHT-TIME(WITH FLASH) OR INDOORS.
      
      
      STORAGE CAPACITY:
      
      NO EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH GOOGLE IS PROVIDING MOTO G USERS WITH 50GB SPACE ON GOOGLE DRIVE FOR 2 YEARS, HAVING AN EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THAN RETRIEVING YOUR DATA FROM CLOUD STORAGE.
      
      
      ACCESSORIES:
      
      USB DATA CABLE IS NOT PROVIDED BY MOTOROLA.
      
      
      CONCLUSION:-
      
      IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO MATCH THE MOTO G'S BANG FOR THE BUCK. THE SCREEN, THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE, THE OS UPDATES AND WITH THIS UNBELIEVABLE PRICE TAG, IT'S GETTING READY TO WALK ALL OVER THE CHEAP DROIDS AND WINDOWS-POWERED SMARTPHONES."
Moto G,5,"I FOUND THE DEVICE VERY DECENT AND ATTRACTIVE.TOUCH SCREEN , DISPLAY AND BATTERY LIFE VERY GOOD.IT IS MY PERSONAL LIKING THAT ANDROID JELLY BEAN WAS BETTER THAN ANDROID KIT KAT.VERY EASY TO OPERATE BY NEW SMART PHONE USERS."
Moto G,5,"I HAD TRANSFERRED MONEY TO MY FRIEND TO GET A NEXUS 5 FROM THE US. DUE TO SHORTAGE OF DAYS FOR RECEIVING DELIVERY BEFORE LEAVING TO INDIA, HE COULDN'T GET THE SAME.
      
      
      BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH I USE A PHONE MY FRIEND STRONGLY SUGGESTED THE MOTOG. READ COUPLE OF REVIEWS. GEEKYRANJIT'S (TECH2BUZZ,COM) REVIEW MADE ME TAKE THE FINAL DECISION TO GO FOR MOTOG.
      
      
      ORDERED THE MOTOG THROUGH STANDARD SHIPPING ON 6TH FEB 12.04AM OVER THE PHONE AND GOT THE SAME VERY NEXT DAY AT AROUND 1PM ON 7TH FEB 2014. AWESOME DELIVERY. FEELING LUCKY THAT I GOT AN AWESOME PHONE FOR HALF THE MONEY I WOULD HAVE SPENT ON THE NEXUS 5 WHICH I WOULDN'T HAVE USED TO ITS CAPABILITY.
      
      
      MOTOG IS INDEED AN IMMENSE VALUE FOR MONEY MOBILE. I DOUBT WHETHER ANY OTHER PHONE WOULD HAVE MATCHED MY EXPECTATIONS EVEN IF I HAD PAID 5K EXTRA.
      
      
      USING 2 SIMS. WITH LOTS OF VOICE CALLS, DECENT LEVEL OF WIFI USAGE AND LITTLE BIT OF 3G BROWSING THE BATTERY IS ALMOST AVAILABLE FOR 2 DAYS. THE BATTERY WOULD EITHER HAVE LITTLE BIT OF LIFE LEFT THE SECOND DAY OR MAYBE IT MIGHT FALL SHORT OF 5-10%.
      
      
      THE CORNING GORILLA 3 GLASS IS NOT SCRATCH PROOF. ITS ONLY SCRATCH RESISTANT. THE VIDEOS SHOWING PEOPLE SCRATCHING WITH NAILS IS ALL HOAX. WITH CAREFUL USAGE I COULD SEE 2 SCRATCHES ON MY SCREEN AFTER 3WEEKS OF USAGE WITHOUT A SCREEN GUARD. HOWEVER ITS INDEED TOO GOOD IN SCRATCH RESISTANCE( NOT SCRATCH PROOF).
      
      
      THE SCREEN CLARITY IS AWESOME. THE CORNING GLASS 3 SCREEN LOOKS AWESOME WITHOUT ANY SCRATCH GUARD.
      
      
      THE BOX HAS A CHARGER OF 550MA WHICH TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO CHARGE.
      
      THE BOX ALSO HAS EARPHONES WHICH IS NOT GREAT IN QUALITY AND IS JUST OK FOR NORMAL USE. I STRONGLY FEEL THAT THE REGULAR SAMSUNG EARPHONES ARE TOO GOOD. UNFORTUNATELY THE SAMSUNG EARPHONE'S ANSWER BUTTON DO NOT FUNCTION ON THE MOTOG."
Moto G,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT THE PHONE ON THE LAUNCH DAY AND ITS BEEN A VERY SATISFACTORY EXPERIENCE SINCE THEN. MORE OR SO KITKAT AND GOOGLE NOW UPDATE MAKES THIS PHONE MORE CLOSER TO NEXUS 5.
      
      CAMERA IS BETTER THAN I THOUGH. IN GOOD LIGHT CONDITION ITS REALLY IMPRESSIVE."
Moto G,5,"I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TODAY. I PLACED ORDER 3 DAYS BACK ON SUNDAY. VERY GOOD BATTERY LIFE. WAS 55% WHEN RECEIVED, WITHOUT CHARGING I USED THIS CELL FOR 9 HRS (INCL WA, CRICBUZZ, GAMES ETC) AND STILL MY BATTERY S LIFE ON 18%. CAMERA IS NOT THAT GOOD BUT GOOD ENOUGH FOR CASUAL MOMENTS. COMFORTABLE HANDLING BECAUSE OF 4.5 INCH SIZE."
Moto G,5,"I ORDERED THIS PHONE ON 1ST DAY ON THE RELEASE DAY AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED UPON RECEIVING THE PHONE. IT WAS DELIVERED TO ME ON SUNDAY AND I USED MY ENTIRE DAY EXPLORING MY PHONE. ITS A GOOD BUDGET PHONE FROM GOOGLE THOUGH NOW ITS A PART OF LENOVO BUT THIS PHONE WAS DESIGNED BY GOOGLE. I SIMPLY LOVE MY PHONE. LIKE TO GIVE YOU SOME PRO AND CONS
      
      
      PRO'S:
      
      1. VERY GOOD PHONE UNDER THIS BUDGET. NO OTHER PHONE DARE TO GIVE YOU UNDER THIS PRICE RANGE. I AM COMPARING IT GOOD BRANDED PHONES SUCH AS SONY OR SAMSUNG
      
      2. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY GOOD.
      
      3. GOT THE LATEST UPGRADE OF KITKAT FROM GOOGLE WHERE OTHER PHONES ARE STILL STRUGGLING FOR THE SAME. APART FROM THIS ONLY NEXUS HAS KITKAT TILL NOW
      
      4. GORILLA GLASS 3-NO NEED OF SCREEN GUARD.
      
      5. I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY LAG AFTER USING IT FOR ALMOST 20 DAYS AND GRAPHICS AND OTHER GOOD QUALITY GAMES WORK FINE WITH NO DELAY
      
      6. GOOD PROCESSOR WITH 1.2 QUAD CORE SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR WHICH PROCESSES REALLY FAST
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. NO SD CARD SUPPORT BUT FOR NORMAL USERS 16GB IS SUFFICIENT."
Moto G,5,I PLACED THE ORDER HALF HEARTEDLY SEEING THE WAITING PERIOD BUT TO MY GREAT SURPRISE I GOT THIS IN A WEEK TIME. NO NEED TO EXPLAIN THE DETAILS OF THE PHONE AS IT IS KNOWN TO MANY OF YOU . BUT THERE IS NO USB CABLE TO CONNECT THE PHONE TO ANY DESK/LAPTOP. DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND OUT. SERIOUSLY SOME ONE CAN HELP ME OUT. OVERALL IT IS WORTH BUYING AND HAPPY CALLING.
Moto G,5,I PURCHASED THE MOBILE PHONE ON THE LAUNCH DATE. DISPLAY AND SPEED ARE BEST IN THIS PRICE RANGE. DELIVERY FROM FILPKART WAS GOOD AND FAST.
Moto G,5,"I PURCHASED THIS DEVICE TODAY. ITS AN ABSOLUTELY GREAT DEVICE IN THIS PRICE RANGE. LOOKS AND PERFORMANCE WISE IS JUST LIKE A HIGH END DEVICE. BACK SIDE IS SOFT RUBBER FINISH , VERY EASY TO HOLD IN ONE HAND. POWER KEY - VOLUME KEY IS PLACED AT PERFECT LOCATION. SCREEN IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING WITH ACCURATE COLOR REPRODUCTION.
      
      ALL PACKAGING AND DELIVERY BY FLIPKART WAS SMOOTH AND I GOT THIS DEVICE WITHIN 3 DAYS."
Moto G,5,"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE ON THE DAY OF THE LAUNCH.
      
      SEEING THE FEATURES AND THE PRICE, I COULD NOT RESIST AND ORDER ONE.
      
      WITH THE PRICE TAG OF AROUND 14K , YOU ARE GETTING THE BEST .
      
      DISPLAY IS MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE IN S3 .
      
      PROCESSING POWER HELPS TO DO MULTITASK AT EASE.
      
      RECENTLY GOT UPDATED TO KITKAT AND WITH TIME MORE UPDATES ON OS WILL BE RECEIVED THAT WILL MAKE USER EXPERIENCE MORE RICH.
      
      OVERALL A GOOD BUY EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THERE WONT BE ANY USB STORAGE AVAILABLE."
Moto G,5,"I WAS EARLIER USING SAMSUNG GALAXY Y PHONE WHICH I PURCHASED FOR 8K TWO AND HALF YEARS AGO.  THE PRICE FOR MOTO G IS ALMOST SAME IF WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION INFLATION. BUT THE PHONE IS WAY AHEAD FROM MY EARLIER PHONE.
      
      PROS:
      
      1. VERY FAST.
      
      2. VERY GOOD BATTERY BACKUP. IT LASTS CLOSE TO TWO DAYS WITH MORE THAN AVERAGE USE OF WIFI AND DATA.
      
      3. EXCELLENT BUILT QUALITY. IT FEELS LIKE A VERY EXPENSIVE PHONE IN THE HAND. SCREEN AND BODY MATERIAL ARE OF VERY HIGH QUALITY.
      
      4.  VERY GOOD CAMERA.  FAR BETTER THAN OTHER PHONES WHICH ARE IN 20 K PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      CONS.:
      
      DID NOT FIND ANY.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE PLANNING FOR A SMART PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE OF 10K I WOULD SUGGEST STRETCH LITTLE BIT AND BUY THIS PHONE. IF YOU ARE PLANNING FOR A SMART PHONE IN 20K RANGE I SUGGEST BUY THIS PHONE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY :)."
Moto G,5,"I WAS ONE OF THOSE LUCKY FEW TO PLACE ORDER IN THE FIRST LOT ESP FOR THE 16 GB. YOUR TIMELY DELIVERY AND SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT AND HELPED ME TO GIFT IT ON TIME. THE PRODUCT IS A VALUE FOR MONEY AND MOTO G AND FLIPKART WERE SPOT ON WITH THE PRICING. AT A TIME WHEN SUB 15K MARKET IS CLUTTERED WITH TOO MANY SUBSTANDARD QUALITY DEVICES, MOTO G HAS STRUCK THE BULLS EYE...WAITING FOR MOTO X FROM FLIPKART AND I HOPE YOU GUYS WONT DISAPPOINT WITH THE PRICING."
Moto G,5,"I WAS READING REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PHONE FROM PAST FEW DAYS FINALLY DECIDING TO GET ONE FOR ME.AS SOON AS I GOT A HOLD OF THIS PHONE, I WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE HOW MOTOROLA CAN AFFORD TO PROVIDE SO MANY FEATURES AT SUCH A LOW COST. HATS OFF MOTOROLA, YOU HAVE MADE LIFE OF SAMSUNG MUCH MORE MISERABLE...
      
      AMAZING PHONE...."
Moto G,5,"I WAS SEARCHING FOR A SMART PHONE FOR PAST TWO WEEKS AND SHORT LISTED LG NEXUS 5 AND MOTO G. THEN DECIDED TO GO FOR MOTO G , BUT SLIGHTLY CONFUSED WITH SOME NEGATIVE FEED BACK ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND FLIPKART.
      
      I WENT AHEAD TO PURCHASE IT ON 20TH FEB EVEN THOUGH THE  DELIVERY TIME MENTIONED IN THE SITE WAS 20 DAYS AS IT WAS OUT OF STOCK. BUT I GOT THE 16 GB VERSION WITH IN 6 DAYS , THANKS TO EXCELLENT SERVICE BY FLIPKART.
      
      I DON'T FIND ANY PROBLEM WITH THE PRODUCT TILL NOW.
      
      MY SUGGESTION TO THOSE  WHO WANT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT IS PLEASE DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY BY THE NEGATIVE FEED BACKS"
Moto G,5,"I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE BUILD QUALITY OF THE PHONE AFTER GOING OVER THE SPECS BUT I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN! THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT WORTH EVER SINGLE RUPEE.
      
      AND GUYS STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT NON-AVAILABILITY! THIS IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN ANYWAY WITH SUCH A GREAT PHONE!"
Moto G,5,"IN ONE SENTENCE.........A CLASS PHONE IN RANGE.
      
      BEST FOR BEGGINERS. PREMIUM FEEL. BEST ANDROID EXPERIENCE. AND GREAT SHIPMENT SERVICE BY FLIPKART. I ORDERED THE 16GB VARIANT ON 21ST AND GOT IT 24TH. I AM LIVING A KOLKATA.
      
      ONLY REGRET, BACK SHELL AND FLIP COVERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. WAITING FOR COMPLETING THE FULL COMBOS. THANK YOU."

      SOUND QUALITY USING SENNHEISER HEADSET GOOD. THE EARPHONES WITH THE PACKAGE IS OF SAME QUALITY WHAT YOU GET WITH NORMAL BUDGET PHONES.
      
      CAMERA IS OK FOR MY USE. I HAVE A DSLR WHEN I REQUIRE QUALITY SO I AM HAPPY WITH THIS 5MP. HDR IS GOOD.
      
      GOOGLE NOW IS AWESOME...(APPLIES FOR ALL ANDROID KITKAT DEVICES..YOU CAN SEND A MESSAGE, SET ALARMS, CALL SOMEONE JUST BY TALKING TO YOU PHONE.. YOU CAN EVEN ASK RANDOM QUESTIONS LIKE ""WHAT IS THE HT OF ACTOR SURYA AND IT WILL VOICE OUT THE ANSWER. (SIMILAR TO SIRI BUT BETTER IN ALL ASPECTS)  IT IS AN AWESOME FEATURE WHICH I WILL USE A LOT)
      
      
      16GB MEMORY IS FINE FOR MY USE. AS OTG SUPPORT IS THERE I CAN MANAGE CARRYING A PENDRIVE FULL OF MOVIES WHEN I NEED.
      
      
      WORTH IT.. I REALLY APPRECIATE MOTO AND FLIPKART TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. BRING A 30K PHONE TO PEOPLE FOR JUST 13K...AMAZING...
      
      
      I HATE SAMSUNG, HTC, SONY WHO JUST LAUNCH PHONES FOR 40K+ AND EXPECT US TO BUY. THE WORST THING IS IT WILL BE OUTDATED IN JUST1 YEAR. MOTO G HAS BETTER PROCESSOR PERFORMANCE THAN LAST YEARS 40 K PHONES LIKE HTC ONE X.
      
      
      -VES
      
      
      NO FB CONTACT INTEGRATION
      
      VANILLA ANDROID LOOKS TOO SIMPLISTIC COMPARED TO HTC.. FOR EX THE CONTACT LIST IS NOT AT ALL APPEALING (I LIKE HTC SENSE A LOT)..BUT IT DOES THE JOB THOUGH..
      
      CAMERA
      
      
      BUT THE -VES ARE NOT FOR MOTOROLA..IT IS FOR ME.  GO COMPARE 30K 720P PHONES IN FLIPKART LIKE HTC AND SONY. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH VALUE MOTOROLA HAS PLACED ON THE TABLE.
      
      
      THE NOSTALGIC THING IS MY FIRST PHONE WAS A MOTO AND THEN I HAD RAZR SOMETIME..NOW AGAIN ""HELLO MOTO"""
Moto G,5,"IT HAS BEEN ABOUT 15 DAYS SINCE I GOT MY MOTO G. PRIOR TO THAT I WAS PLANNING FOR A NEXUS 5 (STILL AM). BUT MY WIFE GOT THIS FOR ME ON OUR ANNIVERSARY. I WAS SOLD ON THE PHONE PRIOR TO BUYING ITSELF GOING BY THE REVIEWS, BUT IT WAS ""IN THAT SEGMENT"" - NOT A PREMIUM PHONE LIKE NEXUS 5. BOY! WAS I MISTAKEN. THIS PHONE HAS ALL THE JAZZ AS IN NEXUS 5 AND YOU ARE GETTING IT FOR LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE. (PLEASE READ THRU COMPLETELY BEFORE YOU START FIRING THE 'HOW CAN U COMPARE NEXUS 5 WITH THIS' GUN).
      
      
      FACTS -
      
      1. RIGHT NOW ONLY NEXUS PHONES AND MOTO G HAS KITKAT. - LATEST ANDROID.AND YEA I SHOW OFF A LOT WITH THIS ALONE!
      
      
      2. I AM GETTING A BATTERY LIFE OF 48 HOURS!! (POST KITKAT, NORMAL USAGE, HIGH ON VIDEO STREAMING AND FB. LESS ON WHATSAPP AND NO GAMING). BUT I ALSO MAKE SURE I DONT KEEP WI-FI OR MOBILE NETWORK ON IF I AM NOT USING. SO ADJUST ACCORDING TO YOUR USAGE.
      
      
      3. I CAN USE IT WITH ONE HAND ALONE WHICH IS A GREAT PLUS!
      
      
      4. LOVE THE MATT FINISHED RUBBERIZED BACK COVER. WHAT A FORM-FACTOR AND GRIP. I GOT THE BLACK ONE.
      
      
      5. SPEED - ABSOLUTELY NO LAG OR ANY PERFORMANCE ISSUE!
      
      
      6. GORILLA GLASS 3 - WHICH OTHER PHONE HAS THIS EXCEPT FOR NEXUS 5?
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS JUST A JOY TO USE.
      
      
      CONS-
      
      
      1. CAN EXPECT SOME FINGER SMUDGES ON THE GLASS. I HVNT PUT ANY COVER AS I WANT TO FEEL THE GLASS TOUCH.
      
      
      2. WELL, NEXUS 5 WILL STILL GET MORE ADULATION JUST BECAUSE OF ITS ROYAL BLOOD. :P
      
      
      JUST GO FOR IT."
Moto G,5,"IT IS BEST PHONE WITH THIS PRICE TAG,
      
      PROS.1.ECONOMY WITH BEST FEATURES.
      
      2.BEST TOUCH SCREEN EXPERIENCE WITH GORILLA GLASS 3
      
      3.BEST PROCESSOR WITH THIS PRICE TAG
      
      4.ANDROID KITKAT UPDATE MAKES IT KING BECAUSE EXCEPT GOOGLE NEXUS EVEN 35K PHONE DOESN'T HAVE KITKAT.
      
      5.ONLINE MOTO CARE MAKES IT UNIQUE.
      
      6.MOTOROLA MIGRATE MAKES IT BEST IN CATEGORY.
      
      MOTOROLA ASSIST GIVES US SMART CALL MANAGEMENT FEATURE.
      
      7.EXTRA PROCESSOR FOR GAMES MAKES BEST EXPERIENCE FOR GAMES.
      
      8.1GB RAM WITH INBUILT MEMORY MAKES IT BEST BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T NEED TO CARE ABOUT OPEN TAB.
      
      9.BEST EXPERIANCE EVER WITH GOOGLE PLUS IN HD EXPERIENCE AS MADE FOR GOOGLE S
      
      
      WHILE CONS ARE NEGLIGIBLE BUT THERE ARE SOME CONS
      
      1.CAMERA QUALITY IS SO SO AND NIGHT PICTURES ARE NOT SO GOOD.
      
      2SPEAKERS ARE LOUD BUT SOMETIMES MAKES NOISE"
Moto G,5,"IT IS THE BEST PHONE FOR THE PRICE..QUAD CORE AND 1 GB RAM IS ENOUGH TO RUN ALL HEAVY APPS. STOCK ANDROID IS EXTREMELY SMOOTH.. GAMES LIKE DEAD TRIGGER, ASPHALT 8 AND SHADOW GUN WORK SMOOTHLY ON THIS DEVICE. MUSIC PLAYBACK IS VERY GOOD.. I AM USING SONY MDR XB30EX (EXTRA BASS) WITH THESE.. NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT EXPANDABLE MEMORY AS IT SUPPORTS OTG."
Moto G,5,"IT?S THE PERFORMANCE THAT DID MOST OF THE SWEEPING-OFF-THE-FEET ? INSTEAD OF AN UNDERPOWERED OR OLD-GENERATION CHIP, MOTO G CARRIES A QUAD-CORE 1.2 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON 400 PROCESSOR, WHICH IS AUGMENTED BY A 1GB RAM. NOW, ON PAPER THIS MIGHT NOT BE THAT IMPRESSIVE, BUT WE GOT QUADRANT SCORES THAT AVERAGED 9010 POINTS. THAT, FOLKS, IS RIGHT UP THE PERFORMANCE STREET ALONG WITH FLAGSHIPS SUCH AS NEXUS 5 AND GALAXY S4. IN NON-GEEK, THIS DEVICE PERFORMS JUST LIKE A PREMIUM SMARTPHON"
Moto G,5,ITS A AWESOME PHONE TO BUY. PRICE IS PERFECT JUST ONE ISSUE MEMORY IS LESS. I THINK MOTOROLA IS GOING TO BE IN THE TOP IN INDIA IF THEY COME WITH PHONES LIKE MOTO G.
Moto G,5,"ITS ACTUALLY COMPARABLE WITH NEXUS 4 &AMP; 5 SANS THE SCREEN SIZE.
      
      
      THE OPERATION IS SEAMLESS..

      C.PURE ANDROID OS
      
      D. DUAL SIM
      
      
      BUT SOME POTENTIAL DRAWBACKS FOR SOME PEOPLE MAY BE:
      
      A. MICRO SIM

      C.NON-REMOVABLE BATTERY

Moto G,5,NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS PHONES ABILITY AND PRICING. BEST PHONE IT WOULD DEFINITELY  BEAT ANY CHINA PHONE LIKE MICROMAX ETC... GO FOR IT...
Moto G,5,"NOTHING MORE TO ADD ON WHAT PEOPLE HAS ALREADY ADDED, JUST GO FOR IT, CAUSE NO OTHER PHONE AT THIS TIME GONNA GIVE YOU ANYTHING LIKE THIS AND SINCE I BOUGHT IT ON LAUNCH DAY I GOT THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE."
Moto G,5,"ORDERED MY MOTO G ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON, GOT IT DELIVERED BY MONDAY AFTERNOON...JUST 24 HRS..AND I LIVE 550 KMS AWAY FROM BANGALORE.
      
      REGARDING THE PHONE, EXCEPT FOR THE CAMERA, EVEYTHING IS VERY GOOD.THE BEST PART IS ITS STOCK ANDROID FEATURE.NO BLOATWARE.BUTTERY SMOOTH INTERFACE.ONE WORD....JUST AMAZING!!!"
Moto G,5,"ORDERED THIS PHONE ON FEB-13 AND GOT IT DELIVERED ON FEB-22. CORRECTLY IN 10 DAYS AS THEY SHOWED.
      
      1.NICE PACKAGING.

      ALL TOGETHER A GREAT PHONE AT A GREAT PRICE.AND I THANK FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING IT NICELY."
Moto G,5,"OVERALL GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH FLIP KART,WHEN I PURCHASED AT THAT TIME EXPECTED DELIVERY DAYS GIVEN 15 TO 20 DAYS BUT LUCKILY I GOT SHIPMENT IN 10 DAYS."
Moto G,5,PHONE IS AWESOME.EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. ORDERED ON MONDAY NIGHT AND RECEIVED TODAY MORNING. KUDOS TO  MOTOROLA FOR THE AWESOME PRODUCT AND FLIPKART  FOR THEIR NICE SERVICE.
Moto G,5,PHONE IS FABULOUS YOU CAN GO FOR IT WITH NO SECOND TAUGHTS AND FLIP KART SUCKS IN ANNOUNCING THE RESULTS
Moto G,5,"PRODUCT IS JUST AMAZING WORTH THE PENNY SPENT ON IT.
      
      
      GOOD TOUCH RESPONSE AND SCREEN RESOLUTION IS GOOD, PHONE IS SO HANDY AND EASY TO CARRY IT.
      
      
      ITS A GOOGLE PRODUCT ! NOW I ENJOY USING IT !"
Moto G,5,"STILL THE BEST BUDGET SMARTPHONE, THE MOTO G IS AN INCREDIBLE BARGAIN THAT PUNCHES WELL ABOVE ITS WEIGHT. IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE FLASH AND RAZZMATAZZ OF A FLAGSHIP PHONE LAUNCH, BUT THE MOTOROLA MOTO G IS STILL A HUGE DEAL, IN BOTH SENSES OF THE PHRASE. IT'S THE FIRST HANDSET LAUNCHED BY MOTOROLA IN INDIA SINCE IT WAS TAKEN OVER BY GOOGLE; AND IT COSTS LESS FOR AN IMPRESSIVE SPECIFICATION. THE MOTO G IS A SOLID, NO NONSENSE HANDSET, IT'S NOT FANCY BUT IT'S NOT UGLY EITHER."
Moto G,5,"SUPERB QUALITY,VERY WELL HANDY ,CHEAP AND BEST WITH EXCELLENT FEATURES ..GO AHEAD TO BUY THIS SMART USER FRIENDLY PHONE..."
Moto G,5,"THE MOTO G HAS EARNED IT'S TITLE OF BEING THE BEST SMARTPHONE TILL DATE, THE PRICING IS PERFECT AND THE FEATURES IT PACKS IS AMAZING.
      
      
      IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE THAT THIS PHONE IS IN HIGH DEMAND AS OTHER MANUFACTURES DO NOT GIVE YOU THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY WITH MOST OF THEIR MODELS, SO FAR EVEN MOTO NEVER DID THAT. BUT WITH THE MOTO G THEY HIT THE BULLS EYE.
      
      
      WHAT I LIKE:
      
      1) PERFECT SIZE AND WELL BUILT
      
      2) PRICING IS RIGHT
      
      3) CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
      
      4) GOOD BATTERY LIFE
      
      5) QUICK SNAPDRAGON 400 QUAD CORE PROCESSORS
      
      6) 1 GB RAM FOR THE LOW PRICE
      
      
      WHAT I WISH WAS ALSO THERE ON IT
      
      1) BETTER CAMERA @ 8MP
      
      2) EXPANDABLE MEMORY CARD SLOT
      
      
      I LOVE THIS PHONE MAN.. ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE I PAID."
Moto G,5,"THE MOTO G IS AN EXCELLENT PHONE AT A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE PRICE.
      
      THE CLARITY OF THE DISPLAY IS TOO GOOD. THE TOUCH IS SO SMOOTH.
      
      MOREOVER YOU GET THE ANDROID STOCK EXPERIENCE WITHOUT ANY MORE JUNK SOFTWARE FROM MOTOROLA.
      
      OVERALL IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE TO HAVE THE PHONE :)
      
      
      THANK YOU FLIPKART FOR SHIPPING THE PHONE WITHIN A DAY OF PURCHASE."
Moto G,5,"THE PHONE IS A GREAT PACKAGE AT THE PRICE IT IS BEING OFFERED. IT CAN COMPETE WITH THE BEST IN CLASS ANDROID PHONES.

      3) NON DETACHABLE BATTERY.
      
      
      OVERALL, BUY! BUY! BUY!"
Moto G,5,"THE PHONE IS PRETTY GOOD FOR WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. THE TOUCH-SCREEN IS RESPONSIVE, THE DISPLAY IS VIBRANT, THE BATTERY LASTS WELL OVER 10 HOURS OF GOOD USAGE (3G DATA, LOCATION REPORTING BACKGROUND APPS, ET ALL.) ANY GAME I THREW AT IT RAN PERFECTLY WELL. (REAL RACING 3, GT RACING 2, BADLAND). THE KITKAT UPDATE WAS OUT WITHIN A WEEK OF GETTING THE PHONE. AND ONE OF THE BEST PERKS IS THE 50 GB OF CLOUD STORAGE ON GOOGLE DRIVE. ANOTHER LITTLE SURPRISE WAS THE ASSIST APP FROM MOTOROLA, WHICH PUTS THE PHONE ON SILENT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN THERE IS AN APPOINTMENT ON MY GOOGLE CALENDER.
      
      
      THERE ARE ONLY A FEW THINGS I COULD COMPLAIN OF, TYPING IS A BIT DIFFICULT PROBABLY BECAUSE THE TOUCH SCREEN IS SOMETIMES NOT PIN POINT ACCURATE, BUT MAYBE I HAVE THIS ISSUE SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM COMING FROM THE PHYSICAL KEYBOARD XPERIA MINI PRO. THE LACK OF EXPANDABLE STORAGE IS AN OBVIOUS ISSUE, BUT EVEN THOUGH 16GB ISN'T AMPLE, IT IS DEFINITELY SUFFICIENT. ANOTHER LITTLE THING THAT CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE WAS THE NOTIFICATION LED WHICH ONLY COMES IN WHITE AND HAS NO RGB OPTIONS. MY CAMERA USE IS MINIMAL AND I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.
      
      
      APART FROM GETTING UPDATES FROM MOTOROLA, THE XDA COMMUNITY HAS EMBRACED THE PHONE QUITE WELL AND HAS ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD."
Moto G,5,"THEY JUST PUT THAT BOOK NOW OPTION TO REDUCE THE TRAFFIC ON MOTO G. MANY PEOPLE ARE SEEKING FOR MOTO G, IT IS A PRESSURE FOR FLIPKART, SO THEY STARTED THE BOOKING SYSTEM.. IF YOU BOOK IT YOUR ITEM WILL BE SHIPPED IN 1 DAY... I BOOKED IT ON 25TH AND IT GOT SHIPPED ON 26TH. AMAZING. ""BOOK NOW"" IS ACTUALLY ""ORDER NOW"" . THE THIS IS A MOTO G. NOTHING MORE, USE IT, YOU WILL BE AMAZED."
Moto G,5,THIS IS A PHONE WHICH IS FAR FAR BETTER THAN IPHONE AND BUTTERY SOFT TOUCH. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOD. JUST CLICK ON THE BUY NOW BUTTON WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED AND WAIT FOR THE AWESOMENESS..... SABAR KA FAAL MEETHA HOTA HAI... I FELT IT THE SAME WAY.
Moto G,5,"THIS IS ONE AWESOME PHONE FOR ITS PRICE. I GOT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND SHE IS EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH IT.
      
      
      WAITING FOR CUSTOM ROMS FOR THIS PHONE TO BE OUT. I'M MORE KEEN ON A SLEEKER LAUNCHER. I DON'T LIKE TOO MANY HOME SCREENS..."
Moto G,5,"THIS IS THE BEST PHONE UNDER 20K , VERY PLEASING TO THE EYE. HAS OPTIMUM SCREEN SIZE , ANDROID 4.3 AND UPGRADES TO 4.4 KITKAT. BUY THIS PHONE OR IF YOU HAVE MORE BUDGET GO FOR GOOGLE NEXUS"

      THANKS FLIPKART FOR QUICK DELIVERY."
Moto G,5,"WELL WHILE REVIEWING THE MOBILE I WILL NOT GO IN TECHNICAL THINGS BECAUSE I AM NOT THE BEST PERSON TO REVIEW IT IN A TECHNICAL WAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION FEW THINGS AFTER USING IT FOR  20 DAYS.
      
      1) DISPLAY - MADE OF CORNING GORILLA GLASS 3 BECAUSE OF WHICH MOBILE WILL ALWAYS LOOK NEW AS THEIR WILL BE NOT SCRATCH ON YOUR PHONE
      
      2) PLAYING THE GAMES - 1.2 GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AND 1 GB RAM MAKES THE GAMING EXPERIENCE SUPERB &AMP; WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM &AMP; BOTH THE SUBWAY SURFER AND TEMPLE RUN GAMES WERE RUN SMOOTHLY.
      
      3) YOU HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF NEWEST ANDROID VERSION 4.4.2 KITKAT
      
      4) DUAL SIM SUPPORT (BOTH ARE MICRO SIM SO YOU HAVE TO CUT YOUR SIM OR OTHERWISE BUY A NEW MICRO SIM) I CUT MY BOTH THE SIM WITHOUT ANY HELP OF NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDERS OR MOBILE REPAIRING STORES) (YOU WILL FIND THE WAY TO CUT THE SIM ON INTERNET)
      
      5) BATTERY 2070 MAH BATTERY GIVES A GOOD PERFORMANCE AS IT IS A SMARTPHONE ITS GIVES A NOMINAL TIME.
      
      6) VOICE CLEARITY WHILE CALLING IS UP TO THE MARKS THOUGH ARE IN CROWDED PLACE YOU CAN HEAR AND RESPONSE WITHOUT MUCH NOISE.
      
      7) 16 GB INBUILT MEMORY - YOU WILL NOT REQUIRE ANY MEMORY CARD(BUY 16 GB VERSION INSTEAD OF 8GB)
      
      8) 4.5 INCH HD DISPLAY WILL GIVE YOUR EYES NICE QUALITY VIEW EXPERIENCE"

Moto G,4,"1. LOOKS = SEXY
      
      2. FEEL = AWESOME WHEN YOU TOUCH IT EVERY TIME
      
      3. EASE OF USE = WELL..YES..OF COURSE.. BUT CAN BE IMPROVED
      
      4. WEIGHT = WELL WELL..AS U R LOOKING FOR A SEXY ONE, THE WEIGHT IS PROPORTIONATE TOO
      
      5. TRUSTWORTHY = GOT THE KITKAT AFTER 3 DAYS OF PURCHASING IT.. AS MOTOROLA PROMISED!
      
      6. BATTERY = THE 2070 MAH BATTERY (WHICH IS NOT REMOVABLE BY THE USER) IS JUST TOO GOOD. AFTER USING IT HEAVILY (NET SURFING, CALLING, MOVIE) FOR 14 HOURS (ALMOST IN A STRETCH) THE BATTERY SHOWED ME THAT HE HAD 24% OF LIFE STILL REMAINS! THIS IS REALLY GOOD!
      
      5. CAMERA = I AM NOT EVEN CLOSE TO MY SATISFACTION WITH THE PICTURE QUALITY OF THE SAID 5 MP REAR CAMERA (THOUGH THE FRONT CAMERA IS SOMEHOW GOOD ENOUGH!). THERE IS LACK OF OPTIONS IN THE SETTING OF THE CAMERA TOO
      
      6. ACCESSORIES = EVERYTHING IS THERE EXCEPT AN USB CORD.. I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BOX
      
      7. FLIPKART = PLACED MY ORDER AT 12:06 AM ON 6TH FEBRUARY (THE MOTO G LAUNCH DAY IN INDIA) AND CAN U BELIEVE IT! I GOT MY MOTO G 16 GB AT 6:30 PM ON 8TH FEBRUARY! AMAZING SERVICE!

Moto G,4,"ABOUT THE MOTO G, ITS REAL VALUE OF MONEY.
      
      MY EXPERIENCE:
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1. BATTERY LIFE(SINGLE SIM): 15 TO 16 HRS(WITH USE OF INTERNET-FB, WHATSAPP, YMAIL, PLAYING GAMES, CALL )
      
      
      2. I HERD THE CALL QUALITY IS NOT GOOD BUT BY EXPERIENCE WITH CALL QUALITY AND CLEAR IS ALSO GOOD(MINE WITH AIRTEL NETWORK)
      
      
      3. DISPLAY IS VERY COOL, FAR FAR BETTER THAN SAMSUNG MOBILES I USED.
      
      
      4.HEAD SET QUALITY IS ALSO VERY GOOD (U MAY NOT LIKE IF UR USING BUD TYPE HEADSETS -SAMSUNG TYPE)

      I HAVE WAITED JUST 10 DAYS TO GET MY MOTO G AND PERSON WHO CAME TO DELIVER MY PHONE WAITED UNTIL I UNBOX AND CHECK THE WORKING CONDITION OF THE PHONE. AFTER I ASSURED HIM THAT PHONE IS IN GOOD CONDITION, THEN HE LEFT.

      OTHER THAN THAT, ITS GOOD MOBILE."
Moto G,4,"AFTER ONE MONTH OF USE, AT THIS PRICE RANGE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT ABOUT THIS PHONE EXCEPT CAMERA. CAMERA IS NOT THAT GREAT WHEN COMPARE TO OTHER PHONES IN THIS PRICE RANGE. ONE MORE CON IS THEY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY USB CABLE FOR DATA TRANSFER. BUT I AM OVERALL SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT"
Moto G,4,"AFTER RESEARCHING FOR 2 WEEKS FINALLY ORDERED THE PHONE AND GOT IT IN A WEEKS TIME. EXCELLENTLY PACKED, DELIVERED ON TIME.
      
      
      AFTER USING A MINIATURE PHONE LIKE GALAXY Y USING MOTO G IS LITTLE TIRESOME. ITS LITTLE HEAVY SO USING THE PHONE WHILE ON BED HURTS MY WRIST A LITTLE. HOPE WILL GET USED TO IT.

      MANY
      
      
      CONS
      
      NO USB CABLE. THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT AS PART OF CHARGER BUT THEY CHOSE TO GIVE A CONVENTIONAL OLD CHARGER TYPE I.E. WIRED COMPLETELY. HEADSET LOOKS ECONOMICAL( READ CHEAP)."
Moto G,4,"AFTER USING FOR A WHILE, FELT SOME ISSUES. IF YOU PLAY GAMES FOR A WHILE, AND IF YOU OPEN ANY OTHER APPLICATION  THE APPLICATION BEING CRASHED SO OFTEN. IF I CLICK THE MENU BUTTON SOMETIMES IT IS SEARCHING FOR THE INSTALLED APPLICATION.

Moto G,4,"AS SOON AS MOTOROLA DECLARED TO LAUNCH ITS MOTO G IN INDIA I WAS REALLY EXCITED FOR IT.
      
      I JUST BOOKED AN 8 GB MOTO G ON 6 FEB AND GOT DELIVERED ON 8 FEB IN DELHI(AS IT COULDN'T DELIVER PRODUCT OVER 10000 IN U.P. BAD WORK ON THAT) I FEELED MORE EXCITED AS THE PHONE LUKED VERY GUD AND PERFORMED TOO GOOD. BUT AFTER FEW DAYS OF WORKING I GOT TO FACE SOME ISSUES LIKE OF ""WIFI CONNECTIVITY"" AND I CALLED SERVICE CENTRE FOR IT THEY TOLD ITS AN TECHINAL ISSUE AND WORKING IS GOING ON TO IMPROVE IT. OTHER ISSUE MOST OF YOU WILL FACE THAT ONCE YOU UPDATE YOUR DEVICE WITH KITKAT ANDROID THE CHARGING PROBLEM WILL START TO HAPPEN AS IT WILL NOT ACCPET ANY OTHER CHARGERS ACCEPT THAT OF MOTO G SO IF YOU WANT TO CHARGE YOU HAVE TO CARRY PERMANENT MOTO G ORIGINAL CHARGERS WITH YOU.

      FAST, GOOD DISPLAY. CAMERA QUALITY ALSO QUITE GOOD IN SUNLIGHT. BATTERY LASTS GOOD ENOUGH. A FEW COMMENTS HAD MENTIONED THAT ONCE DRAINED THE BATTERY HAS TO BE REMOVED BY TAKING THE SCREWS OUT ETC..I'VE DRAINED IT COMPLETELY A COUPLE OF TIMES. EACH TIME A RECHARGE WOULD BRING IT BACK. NEVER HAD TO TAKE THE BATTERY OUT.
      
      
      TOTAL STORAGE IN 8 GB IS ONLY 5.52 GB FOR USE. HAD AN UPGRADE TO 4.4.2 KITKAT, THOUGH DIDN'T SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE AFTER THE UPGRADE.

Moto G,4,HAVING GRATE EXPERIENCE WITH MOTO G. THE BATTERY LIFE AND DISPLAY QUALITY IS EXTREMELY GOOD. I AM HAPPY WITH OVERALL PERFORMANCE. NO LAG BUT ONE OR TWO TIME I HAVE FACED ISSUE WITH THE ICON FONT (ITS UNREADABLE) MAY BE IT IS BECAUSE OF MULTITASKING OR FULL USAGE OR RAM. BUT ALL I CAN SAY MOTO G IS GREAT SMART PHONE.
Moto G,4,"HELLO GUYZ...I ORDERED MY MOTO G 8GB VERSION ON THE DAY OF LAUNCH I.E 6TH OF FEB AND RECEIVED THE PHONE ON 10TH..SO FK AS FAR AS DELIVERY IS CONCERNED HATS OFF..
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THE PHONE FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS NOW AND HERE`S AN HONEST REVIEW.
      
      
      1. THE FIRST IMPRESSION U`LL GET WOULD BE THE BUILD QUALITY. YAA ITS HEAVIER THAN OTHER PHONES BUT U`LL FEEL THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE PHONE WHEN U HOLD.THE BACK PANEL HAS A RUBBER COATING WHICH HELPS IN GRIPPING THE PHONE QUITE EFFICIENTLY.THE SPEAKERS ARE ACCURATELY PLACED SO NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.
      
      
      2. WITH 4.50-INCH 720X1280 DISPLAY MOTO G DOES  JUSTICE TO THE VIVID PICTURE QUALITY WE DESIRE. I HAD BEEN PLAYING A LOT OF HD GAMES LIKE REAL RACING 3, ASPHALT 8, RIPTIDEGP2 AND THE GAMES RUN FLAWLESLLY W/O ANY GLITCHES.
      
      
      3. AS FAR AS THE SOUND QUALITY IS CONCERNED I WOULD SAY THAT ITS UP TO THE MARK COZ THIS PHONE LIES IN THE  BUDGET PRICE RANGE.WITH EQUALIZATION U CAN CUSTOMIZE THE SOUND EFFECTS ACCORDING TO UR NEEDS.
      
      
      4. CAMERA WHICH IS OF 5MP HAS A QUITE IMPRESSIVE CAPTURE QUALITY. THE PHONE CAPTURES MORE THAN EXPECTED QUALITY PICTURES AND ON LOW LIGHT SOMETIMES THE QUALITY IS NOT UP TO THE MARK.BUT STILL THE PERFORMANCE IS MODERATE ON LOW LIGHT TOO.
      
      
      5. THE CALL QUALITY- I WOULD SAY THAT I WAS BIT DISSAPOINTED BECOZ THE EXPERIENCE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. INITIALLY I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS MY DEVICE PROBLEM BUT WHEN I SAW THE SAME QUALITY IN MY FRIENDS` MOTO G TOO I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE VOICE QUALITY IS NOTWHAT I EXPECTED.
      
      
      6. BATTERY LIFE IS EXCEPTIONAL.I HAVE BEEN GETTING A DAY AND A HALF ON NORMAL USAGE WHICH INCLUDES WIFI ON, 30MINS OF MUSIC., 1HR OF CALL, 1HR OF HD GAMING WITH LIVE WALLPAPER
      
      
      SO OVERALL THE PERFORMANCE OF MOTO G IS EXCEPTIONAL AND WITH THE PRICE TAG AND SPECIFICATIONS UNDOUBTEDLY ITS THE BEST BUY OF 2014."

      CHARGER IS HEATING.
      
      
      THE ONLY DISAPPOINTING THING IS GORILLA GLASS.
      
      AND TO FULL CHARGE ITS TAKING ABOUT 3 HOUR..!!!?
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS JUST OK.. NORMAL USAGE WITH 2G IT LASTS 14 HOUR.

      DEVICE IS GREAT CONSIDERING THE PRICE; SCREEN QUALITY AND TOUCH RESPONSE ARE IMPRESSIVE.
      
      HANDLES GAMES LIKE REAL STEEL,DEER HUNTER2 WITH EASE.
      
      FITS PERFECTLY IN HAND AND IS NOT MUCH HEAVY.
      
      CAMERA IS AVERAGE, BUT TAKES DECENT PICS.
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD.
      
      FEW OF THE CONS THAT I HAVE NOTICED SO FAR (COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH MY DEVICE):-
      
      1. TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO CHARGE.
      
      2. CONNECTING AND DISCONNECTING CALLS TAKES FEW SECONDS MORE THAN USUAL.
      
      
      CONSIDERING THE SPECIFICATIONS, BUILT QUALITY AND PRICE I CAN SAY IT IS THE BEST DEVICE AVAILABLE UNDER 15K. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
Moto G,4,"IF YOU LOOKING AT A PHONE THAT LOOKS GOOD, FITS PERFECTLY IN YOUR HAND, IS RUNNING ON LATEST ANDROID, IMPRESSIVE GRAPHICS FOR YOUR GAMING EXPERIENCE, GREAT PROCESSOR FOR QUICK APPS LOADING AND ACCESS AND A PHONE THAT IS LIGHT ON YOUR POCKETS MOTO G IS THE PHONE FOR YOU.

Moto G,4,"MOTO G 16GB HAS HIT THE SWEET SPOT OF PRICE &AMP; FEATURE COMBINATION. THE COMPROMISES MADE TO ACHIEVE THE PRICE POINT - CHEAPER CAMERA, LIMITED INBUILT STORAGE DOESN'T TAKE MUCH AWAY FROM THE OVERALL BRILLIANCE OF ALMOST STOCK ANDROID, GREAT SCREEN, SPEED AND BATTERY LIFE. NO EXPANDABLE STORAGE MEANS THAT THE 16GB IS THE PREFERABLE CHOICE. THE DUAL SIM CAPABILITY SWEETENS THE DEAL. A MUST BUY FOR A DISCERNING INDIAN BUYER LOOKING FOR A PREMIUM FEEL PHONE ON A BUDGET."

Moto G,4,"SO HERE IT GOES ,GOT MY MOTO G ,I ORDERED IT ON THE FIRST DAY AND GOT THAT AFTER THREE DAYS.ITS BEEN 15 DAYS THAT I HAVE BEEN USING IT AND MOST OF THE THINGS IN IT ARE AWESOME WHICH INCLUDES KITKAT UPGRADE ALSO .BUT I HAVE FOUND A BUG IN IT ,IT SUPPORTS 3G ON BOTH THE SLOTS,BUT THE PROBLEM IS SOMETIMES IT GOES TO THE EDGE CONNECTION INSPITE OF THE OPTION SELECTED IN THE SETTING IS  3G PREFERABLE.I HAVE TO USE SOMETIMES THIRTY PARTY APP TO FORCE THE MOTO G TO ACCEPT THE 3G CONNECTION AND THEN IT ACCEPT IT.RESOLUTION COLOR ARE VERY GOOD,PLAY GAMES LIKE REAL RACING ,ASPHALT8, DEAD TRIGGER WITHOUT ANY LAG.SUPPORTS OTG CABLE ALSO.LONG STORY CUT SHORT ITS WORTH A BUY"
Moto G,4,THE PHONE IS AWEOME. ITS WAS SHIPPED ON THE DUE DATE( NOT SOO GOOD). THOUGHT THAT FLIPKART FOOLED ME ABOUT THE OFFERS FOR A WHILE. GO FOR 16GB VERSION. GO FOR MOTO X IF U HAVE THE BUDGET AND THE TIME OF ABOUT 2 TO 3 WEEKS(U WOULDN'T REGRET WAITING A COUPLE WEEKS).
Moto G,4,THE PHONE IS GOOD BUT CAMERA STOPPED WORKING AFTER KITKAT UPDATE. AWAITING RESOLUTION FROM FLIPKART / MOTOROLA
Moto G,4,"THE PRODUCT IS NO DOUBT VERY GOOD THATS WHY AFTER READING LOTS OF REVIEW I DECIDED TO BUY IT.
      
      THE DELIVERY BY FLIPKART WAS VERY FAST AS IT WAS NOT EXPECTED TO BE QUICKED BUT ANYHOW THE PACKAGING DISAPPOINTED ME."
Moto G,4,THE PRODUCT WAS RECD IN TIME AND THE QUALITY OF THE TROUDSERS WERE AS EXPECTED.OVERALL NICE EXPERIENCE
Moto G,4,"THIS IS THE UNDISPUTED BEST SMARTPHONE IN THIS RANGE, PROCESSOR IS V V FAST, DISPLAYS ARE AWESOME, ONLY CON IS BATTERY BACKUP...ALSO IT TAKES TIME TO CHARGE, REST EVERYTHING IS PERFECT!!!!"
Moto G,4,"THIS PHONE IS TRULY VALUE FOR MONEY, HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE IT LACKS CERTAIN FANCY FEATURES UNLIKE SAMSUNG, SONY ETC. MAYBE BECAUSE OF CORE OS. THE CAMERA QUALITY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, U CAN'T SET SONGS AS THE RINGTONE UNLESS U DOWNLOAD ANY 3RD PARTY S/W, FOR GAME LOVERS, THIS PHONE IS QUITE A BLESSING WITH CHEAP PRICE,, GOOD GRAPHICS CARD AND VERY GOOD BATTERY LIFE.BUT YES HEADPHONES ARE A BIT DISAPPOINTING AND ALSO IT DOESN'T COMES WITH A USB, SO PREPARE TO BUY ONE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE...ALL IN ALL,,THIS PHONE IS DEFINITELY A  BEST BUY WITHIN UPTO 20K PRICE TAG, BUY THIS AND YOU WOULD NVR COMPLAIN OF ANYTHING ;)"
Moto G,4,"TO EVEN THINK THAT GOOGLE DID NOT GIVE THE MOTO G AND MOTO X ENOUGH TO BREATHE BEFORE YANKING THEM OFF THEIR PRODUCT RANGE, MAKES ME THINK IF GOOGLE WAS EVEN COMMITTED TO MAKING A GOOD PRODUCT. BUT TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS, THE MOTO G EVEN THOUGH IS A SLIGHTLY TONED DOWN VERSION OF THE MOTO X IS NOT MEERKAT AMONGST WOLVES. IT IS IN FACT THE OTHER WAY AROUND, IT IS THE WOLF AMONGST THE MEERKATS.
      
      TAKE ANY OTHER DEVICE IN ITS PRICE RANGE AND STACK IT UP AGAINST THE MOTO G AND YOU'D BE HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE BRAND THAT INVENTED THE CELLULAR PHONE IS BACK WITH A BANG AND HERE TO STAY. THE MOTO G (16GB VARIANT) HAS NO FRILLS ATTACHED AND COMES WITH THE BARE MINIMUM ACCESSORIES - CHARGER ADAPTOR (NO USB DATA CABLE), HEADPHONES (SAD ONE TO BE HONEST) AND THE PAPERS.
      
      ONE OF THE BIGGEST HURDLES IN FRONT OF SOMEONE LOOKING TO MOVE FROM AN OLDER ANDROID PHONE TO A NEW ONE IS BEING ABLE TO PORT OVER ALL CONTENT ONTO THE NEW DEVICE. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CHEEZY ATTEMPTS AT THIS PROCESS AND SOME COMPANIES HAVE TRIED SLIPPING IN THEIR OWN BRANDED SUITES FOR THE SAME. THEY HAVE FAILED MISERABLY UNTIL NOW. I HAVE USED AND HELPED OTHERS USE A GOOD DOZEN ODD ANDROID DEVICES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. THIS USED TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM.
      
      ENTER 'MOTO MIGRATE', A MAGICAL APP THAT NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED ON THE OTHER DEVICE TOO AND WITH A SIMPLE ENOUGH PROCESS OF SCANNING A QR CODE ON THE NEW DEVICE (OR OLDER) YOU ARE SMILING AWAY TO MOBILE DATA MIGRATION NIRVANA. MOTO MIGRATE SHOULD BE THE DEFAULT APP FOR ALL ANDROID-ANDROID DATA MIGRATION. IT IS PURE MAGIC! OVERALL I HAVE NO REGRETS IN HAVING BOUGHT THIS DECVICE FOR MY WIFE AND THE BEST PART IS, I SOLD AN EXPENSIVE OLDER DEVICE AND NOW HAVE SOME CASH LYING AROUND FOR US TO SPEND AFTER BUYING THIS ONE. TELL ME FAIRY TALES DON'T HAPPEN...

Moto G,4,"WELL AFTER A LONG RESIST TOWARDS A SMART PHONE I FINALLY BOUGHT ONE(WELL NOT REALLY.. I HAD NOKIA 5800 WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SMARTPHONES TO BE LAUNCHED IN INDIA AN I STILL HAVE IT) THIS PHONE DOESN'T DISAPPOINTS.. I HAVE ALREADY USED HTC AND SAMSUNG(BOTH BELONG TO MY BRO) THIS PHONE SEEMS IN THE SAME LEAGUE HOPE IT KEEPS UP AS LONG AS I USE IT.
      
      
      DISAPPOINTMENT I DIDN'T GET A USB CONNECTOR.."
Moto G,4,WELL I BOUGHT MOTO G MAINLY FOR MY FATHER. IT WAS HIS B'DAY AND I WANTED TO GIFT HIM A FONE WITH ALL THE LATEST FEATURES BUT HAD A BUDGET OF 20K ONLY. I WAS GONNA FINALISE ON LENOVO AND SOME HTC FONE BUT THEN I GOT TO KNOW ABOUT MOTO G AND ITS FEATURES + THE PRICE TAG. I ADMIT THAT I HAD TO W8 FOR A WEEK FOR THE LAUNCH BUT THE DAY IT WS LAUNCHED I ORDERED IT. RECEIVED IT IN 2-3 DAYS ONLY. MY FATHER MAINLY USES HIS FONE FOR CALLING AND MAILS. SO FAR THE FONE HAS BEEN ACCIDENTALLY BEEN DROPPED IN WATER AND OUT OF A MOVING CAR BUT TO MY SURPRISE ITS STILL WORKING JUST FINE. EVEN THE GORILLA GLASS IS IMPRESSIVE AS THRS NO SCRATCH GUARD ON THE FONE YET + NO COVER BUT STILL THE SCREEN IS SCRATCH FREE TILL NOW. EASY TO USE AND HAS DUAL SIM SO EARLIER HE HAD TO CARRY 2 FONES BUT NOW THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED. NET SURFING IS WAY FASTER THAN HIS PREVIOUS SAMSUNG FONE. I AGREE THAT MOST OF YOUNG USERS MAY WANT MORE MEMORY THAN CURRENT 16GB BUT FOR NOW ITS GREAT.
Moto G,4,"WELL,
      
      ITS A AWESOME PHONE IN ITS VALUE TAG. CAMERA IS LITTLE DISAPPOINTING BUT THATS OK IN THIS PRICE.
      
      SCREEN - 5
      
      CAMERA - 2
      
      PERFORMANCE - 5
      
      LOOKS - 4
      
      BATTERY - 4
      
      STORAGE - 4"
Moto G,3,"ALL THE ITEMS WELL PACKED IN GOOD CONDITION BUT I FOUND DATA CABLE MISSING IN MY ORDER, IT HAS CHARGED INSTEAD."
Moto G,3,ANY USER CAN PLEASE TELL ME IF THIS PHONE CAN BE USED AS A HOT SPOT OR THIS FUNCTION HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM MOTO G
Moto G,3,"BOOKED THE PHONE ON 9TH FEB AND I GOT IT ON 19TH FEB.
      
      THE PHONE IS AWESOME. BUT I AM FACING TWO MAJOR ISSUES.
      
      1. WHEN I SWITCH ON VIDEO RECORDING, THE CAMERA APP STOPS WORKING WITH AN ERROR ""UNFORTUNATELY CAMERA HAS STOPPED WORKING""
      
      2. SOMETIMES ON A AUDIO CALL I DONT HEAR THE OTHER PARTY, NEITHER ON HANDSET NOR ON LOUDSPEAKER."
Moto G,3,"CAMERA RESULT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
      
      CARD SLOT NOT AVAILABLE  THAT IS BIG DISADVANTAGE.
      
      PERFORMANCE IS GOOD.
      
      USER INTERFACE IS NOT GOOD. MOTO TEAM HAVE TO CHANGE IT...."
Moto G,3,"CUTTING TO THE CHASE, HERE IS MY QUICK REVIEW
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. EXCELLENT EYE CANDY SCREEN
      
      2. SUPERB TOUCH FEEL ON THE GORILLA GLASS
      
      3. QUITE FAST, DOES NOT LAG
      
      4. GOOD LOUDSPEAKER
      
      5. QUICK GPS LOCK
      
      6. GOOD BATTERY LIFE
      
      7. UPGRADED TO 4.4.2
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. DID HANGED 3-4 TIMES THE VERY FIRST DAY AND SO FAR AT LEAST ONES THE OTHER DAYS. THIS HAPPENS 50% OF TIME USING GOOGLE NOW VOICE RECOGNITION.
      
      2. DISAPPOINTED WITH CALL QUALITY BOTH ON EARPIECE AND SPEAKER (SPEAKER WORKS GREAT THOUGH WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC)
      
      3. SLOW CHARGING TIME
      
      
      RATING 3 FOR NOW, AS IT DOES NOT DELIVER ON THE CALL QUALITY. I HOPE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH SOFTWARE AND MOTO WILL RECTIFY THE ISSUE.
      
      
      MORE UPDATE WILL FOLLOW IN COMING DAYS."
Moto G,3,EVEN THOUGH THE SPECS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS AMAZING FOR THIS PRICE A MAJOR DRAWBACK  IS LACK OF DLNA....SO THIS IS A SMARTPHONE WITHOUT THE SMART APPLICATION(DLNA)
Moto G,3,"FLIPKART SERVICE IS REALLY NICE.....
      
      AFTER SUBMITTING A BAD REVIEW I GOT A EMAIL FROM FLIPKART THAT EDIT THE PRODUCT REVIEW AND HERE I AM WITH EDITED REVIEW :)"
Moto G,3,GOOD PHONE WITH GOOD FEATURE AND PRICE.  BUT WITHOUT FLIP COVER IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE IT.  FLIPKART TO ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF FLIP COVER FOR THIS MOBILE
Moto G,3,"GOODS:
      
      -DISPLAY IS QUITE BRIGHT AND CLEAR.
      
      -BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      -FRONT CAMERA IS GOOD.
      
      -GUARANTEED UPGRADE TO KITKAT
      
      -MUSIC IN BETTER EARPIECES OF JBL IT QUITE AWESOME.
      
      -NO HANG ISSUE.
      
      -TOUCH IS NOT OF THAT GOOD QUALITY, WHILE PLAYING TEMPLE RUN 2 IT MISSES SOMETIMES.
      
      
      BADS:
      
      -LOOKING ON SCREEN FOR A BIT LONGER IRRITATES THE EYES.
      
      -EAR PIECE IS THE CHEAPEST ONES.
      
      -DATA CABLE IS NOT IN BOX.
      
      -MAIN CAMERA IS WORSE THAN THE REVIEWS.
      
      
      IN MY VIEWS THE MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS PHONE IS ITS IRRITATION TO EYES. YOU CANNOT GAZE THE SCREEN FOR A LONGER, THUS REDUCING THE USE OF PHONE. CONSIDERING PRICE RANGE IT S A GOOD PRODUCT ALTHOUGH ITS RATING CAN BE FAR BETTER IF SCREEN GAZING DOES NOT IRRITATE EYES."
Moto G,3,"GOT IT TODAY AND THAUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE GR8 PHONE BUT HAS SOME PROBLEMS
      
      
      1) CAMERA, BOTH FRONT AND BACK CAMERA ARE AWFUL, BACK CAMERA(PRIMARY) IS GOOD UNTILL NOT ZOOMED AFTER ZOOMING EVEN TOI SMALLEST UNIT THE CAMERA QUALITY TURNS TO VGA RATHER THAN 5MP, FRONT(SECONDARY CAMERA) IT LOOKS LIKE VGA FROM STARTING AND TURN OUT TO WORST IF ZOOMED :3
      
      
      2) NO TASK MANAGER OR FEATURE TO CLOSE ALL APPS AT ONCE
      
      
      3) HEATS UP UPON USING FOR MORE THAN 3HOURS ON 3G :3
      
      
      4) CHARGING TIME IS TOOOO MUCH
      
      
      5) I DONT KNOW Y BUT THERE IS NOO NEED OF DOUBLE SIM IN SMARTPHONES AND IT HAS AND I THINK IF THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER SLOT FOR 2ND SIM AND ANOTHER STUFF REQUIRED TO MAKE IT WORK THE BATTERY BACKUP WOULD BE LOT MORE BETTER :3
      
      
      6) TFT  SCREEN :/
      
      
      7) NO USB CABLE(I HATE THIS PHONE)
      
      
      GOOD THING I KNOW IS
      
      --&GT; ANDROID 4.3
      
      --&GT; BATTERY LASTS FOR COMPLETE DAY IF NOT USING INTERNET
      
      --&GT; BOOTS QUICKLY(I STILL HATE BOOT SCREEN)
      
      --&GT; TOUCH INTERFACE IS GOOD THAN OTHER PHGONES LIOKE MICROMAX

Moto G,3,"HAVEN'T BOUGHT THIS PHONE YET AND THINKING OF BUYING THIS IN A MONTH OR 2.
      
      
      THIS PHONE MAY BE GOOD. BUT REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT THIS PHONE HAS :
      
      ""SIM TYPE	DUAL SIM, GSM + GSM, (DUAL STANDBY)""
      
      
      ""DUAL ACTIVE"" IS NOT PRESENT AT ALL IN THIS PHONE AND SURPRISING NOBODY TALKED ABOUT IT."

Moto G,3,"HI GUYS, COULD YOU TELL ME IF BOTH THE SIM SLOTS IN MOTO G 16 GB SUPPORT 3G OR 1 3G + 2G AND OTHER ONLY 2G. BECAUSE I ASKED MOTO G SUPPORT THEY SAID BOTH SLOTS SUPPORT 3G BUT FLIPKART GUYS SAID ONE 3G AND OTHE ONLY 2G. COULD SOMEONE PLEASE CLEAR MY DOUBT WHO HAS USED IN REAL TIME.
      
      THANK YOU"
Moto G,3,"HI GUYS...
      
      THIS PHONE IS GOOD... I GOT A NEWS THAT BLACKBERRY Z10 IS NOW AVAILABLE AT RS. 17990/-.  PLEASE EXPLORE THE OPTION WHICH IS A MUCH BETTER BUY THAN THIS..."
Moto G,3,"HI PPL
      
      ITS NOT OFTEN I WRITE A REVIEW BUT I JUST GOT THE PHONE YESTERDAY AND AFTER ALL THE UP-GRADATION AND EVERYTHING I FIND THAT MY FREE  SPACE IS JUST 4GB. AM RUNNING 4.4 KIT KAT AND THAT WAS UPDATED AFTER I OPENED MY PHONE ON MY WIFI..........AFTER  INSTALLING APPS FACEBOOK, WHATS APP UPDATING YOUTUBE AND EVERYTHING ELSE (MIND YOU NOTHING ELSE IS INSTALLED) MY FREE SPACE IS 4 GB...... IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH THAT...GOOD GO FOR IT....NOTHING CAN GET BETTER THAN THIS.........OTHERWISE 4GB.ITS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME......GO FOR THE 16GB.........!!!!!
      
      IN THIS AGE, IT EVEN SUCKS THAT THEY HAVE AN 8GB...(NOW I KNOW) I FELL FOR IT SO MAYBE I WILL LIVE WITH IT.....GRRRR WHERE IS MY LAPPY????.......I COULD HAVE WAITED...I WOULD HAVE WAITED...IF SOMEONE WOULD HAVE JUST MENTIONED THAT IN THE REVIEW.... .."
Moto G,3,"HI, I RESIDE IN GURGAON..I PLACED AN ORDER MOTO G, 8GB ON 17TH FEB...STILL DIDN'T RECIEVE ANY INFORMATION REGARDING SHIPMENT....SAW LOT OF REVIEWS THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING IT WITHIN 3 DAYS OF THEIR ORDER...IS IT LOCATION THAT IS PLAYING ROLE IN DELIVERY SCHEDULE?????? STATUS SHOWS - PAYMENT APPROVED...WILL SHIP ONCE RELEASED.....
      
      
      FLIPKART TEAM,
      
      6 DAYS ARE OVER, NO INFORMATION YET........WHY THE PEOPLE WHO ORDERED LATER GOT EARLIER?????
      
      BEING A REGULAR CUSTOMER, I DIDN'T EXPECT SUCH BIAS........."
Moto G,3,"HI,
      
      
      IS THIS PHONE MOTO G IS WORTH WAITING? AS THE OTHER MOTOROLA PHONES WERE NOT AS EXPECTED IN INDIAN MARKET. THE AS THE MOTOROLA PRODUCTS HAVE DIFFERENCES IN USABILITY PERSPECTIVE. RIGHT SIDE MENU'S ON LEFT SIDE AS PER US STANDARD. IS THIS PRODUCT ALSO FOLLOW THE SAME STANDARD OR ACROSS GLOBAL USUALLY FOLLOWED STANDARDS?"
Moto G,3,"HI,
      
      MOTO G IS AWESOME MOBILE IT WAS WORKING FINE AND WAS AS SMOOTH AS BUTTER .
      
      BUT AFTER UPDATING TO KIT KAT 4.4.2, I STARTED FACING ISSUES. (BUT STILL MUCH BETTER AND WAY AHEAD OF SAMSUNG GRAND AND QUATTRO).
      
      
      THE SCREEN IS GETTING BLACKED OUT WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN APPS AND I COULD SEE THERE IS A BIT DELAY IN OPENING APPS.
      
      
      I UNINSTALLED SOME APPS BUT AGAIN THE ISSUE REMAINS.
      
      
      SOMETIMES THE SCREEN BLACK OUT IS APPEARING FOR FEW SECONDS
      
      AND SOMETIMES IT REMAINS PERMENANTLY UNTIL I HIT THE HOME BUTTON AND WAIT FOR SOMETIME.
      
      
      I AM NOT SURE IF THE ISSUE IS BECAUSE OF KIT KAT UPGRADE OR INSTALLING FEW EXTRA APPS."
Moto G,3,I AM COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE MOTO G. THE UI IS NOT THAT MUCH FRIENDLY. SKYPE CALLS AND INTERNET IS BIT SLOW. CAMERA IS OK BUT SOME TIMES GIVING ERRORS. BATTRY IS GOOD. BUT AT THIS COST 14K IN INDIA ITS BIT TOO HIGH AS OTHER MOBILES ARE ALSO WORKING SAME AS MOTO G AT 10-12K. PERFORMANCE WISE ALSO BIT LAGGING. JUST BECAUSE OF THE HIPE CREATED GETTING MANY ORDERS.
Moto G,3,I BOOKED ON 9TH AND GOT MY MOTO G TODAY 19TH FEB.....THE BOX CONTAINS CHARGER AND HEAD SET....NO DATA CABLE......EXCITING TO C THE PERFORMANCE.....THANKS FLIPKART
Moto G,3,"I BROUGHT THE NEW MOTO G ON 21ST FEB.
      
      
      THE INTERNAL MEMORY WHAT IT SHOWING ON IS 8 GB ACTUALLY IT IS NOT 8 GB ONLY 5 GB.
      
      
      I WON'T RECOMMEND IT FOR THOSE WANT MORE SPACE.
      
      
      BATTERY IS OK BUT NOT UPTO THE MARK ONLY ONE DAY AFTER IT WILL DRIED UP.
      
      
      YOU WILL GET SURE ANDROID 4.4 UPDATE I GOT IT AND UPDATED.
      
      
      THE EAR PHONES ARE IN CHEAP QUALITY AND NO USB CABLE."
Moto G,3,"I DON'T KNOW WHY FLIP KART IS ASKING TO RESERVE THE PHONE.  WHEN I BOOKED DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, AS PER FLIPKART, IT WOULD TAKE MINIMUM 10 DAYS FOR 16 GB, AND I GOT IT DELIVERED TODAY.  I THINK THE PHONES ARE AVAILABLE PLENTY AND THEY WANT TO SHOW US THAT THE PHONE HAS HUGE DEMAND. DON'T KNOW AND I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THAT.   BUT SERVICE IS GOOD.  I CAN NOT COMMENT ON THE PHONE AS I JUST RECEIVED."

Moto G,3,"I GOT IT ON 16TH OF THIS MONTH. SIM 1 IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY, IT GETS FREQUENTLY DISCONNECTED. I COMPLAINED TO FLIPKART, THEY ADVISED ME TO GO TO A SERVICE STATION IN AHMEDABAD, I WENT THERE. HE JUST DID FORMAT AND GAVE ME BACK. THE ISSUE IS NOT RESOLVED, I HAVE ASKED FOR REPLACEMENT. LET US SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I WILL BE WRITING ABOUT THIS AGAIN. OTHERWISE PHONE IS WORKING GOOD."
Moto G,3,"I GOT THE 8GB VERSION 2 WEEKS AGO. SOME WEBSITES FALSELY ADVERTISED THAT THE PHONE HAS 24 HOURS OF TALKTIME ( WHICH IS NOT TRUE ). THE ACTUAL CLAIM AS PER MOTOROLA'S WEBSITE IS THAT THE BATTERY LASTS 24 HOURS ON MIXED USAGE &AMP; THIS IS TRUE. SINCE I LIKE TO PLAY GAMES, I INSTALLED TEMPLE RUN OZ. THE BATTERY DRAINS VERY QUICKLY WHILE PLAYING. I PLAYED FOR 30 MINUTES &AMP; THE BATTERY WAS DRAINED BY 15%. THE BACK OF THE PHONE ( BATTERY ) WAS ALSO NOTICEABLY HEATED UP (WARM NOT HOT) AFTER 30 MINUTES OF PLAYING. THIS WAS THE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT FROM THIS PHONE. IF YOU ARE THINKING OF OUTDOOR USAGE, THEN THIS PHONE WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE BECAUSE IN INDIA THE PHONE IS NOT SUPPLIED WITH USB CHARGER / DATA CABLE IN THE BOX (ONLY THE WALL CHARGER). I WAS THINKING OF BUYING ANOTHER ONE (THE 16 GB VERSION) BUT HAVE NOW DECIDED AGAINST IT."
Moto G,3,"I HAD RECEIVED MOTO G AFTER WAITING FOR A LONG DAYS I.E ABOUT 12 DAYS,ONCE I OPENED  THE BOX I GOT CONFUSED AND DISAPPOINTED,BECAUSE....
      
      
      1)THE USB DATA CABLE WAS THERE IN THE BOX (MAIN DRAW BACK BECAUSE IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE MOTOROLA WEBSITE THAT THE BOX CONTAINS MICRO USB CABLE)
      
      
      2)THE SIM WHICH WE ARE GOING TO USE FOR IT,SHOULD BE MICRO SIM,SO WE HAVE TO TRIM THE ORIGINAL SIM WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET @ PRESENT,WHICH WE CAN'T USE FOR OTHER PHONES EXCEPT SOME BASIC PHONES.
      
      
      3)THE ONE MORE POINT FROM WHICH I GOT DISAPPOINTED IS THE CAMERA,WHICH IS JUST 5MP REAR, NOT AT GOOD ONE FOR THAT PRICE RANGE,AT LEAST THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN 8MP.
      
      
      4) I WONDER WHY THEY ARE NOT BRINGING FLIP COVER OR BACK COVER EVEN THOUGH THE SALE OF MOTOG IS SO HIGH,FROM LAST 4 DAYS I AM LOOKING FOR THE BACK COVER ITS SHOWING OUT OF STOCK,VERY SAD.
      
      
      5) THE TOUCH RESPONSE IS NOT SO GOOD AS EXPECTED.
      
      
      6) VERY SAD TO FEEL THAT ITS NOT HAVING EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD OPTION.
      
      
      SOME OF THE GOOD POINTS I GOT IS....
      
      
      1) AS SOON IT GET SWITCHED ON THE ANIMATION AND THE DISPLAY BRIGHTNESS MAKES YOU FLAT....!
      
      
      2) THE STUNNING LOOK OF GORILLA GLASS IS AWESOME AND WORTH FOR THIS PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      3) THE BATTERY BACK UP IS GOOD COMPARATIVELY.
      
      
      4) THE PROCESSOR AND THE INBUILT MEMORY STORAGE IS TOO GOOD FOR THIS PRICE.
      
      
      5) THE PANORAMA,SLOW MOTION VIDEO,AND THE UI OF THE CAMERA IS GOOD ENOUGH."
Moto G,3,"I HAV BEEN WAITING QUITE ALONG FOR DIS AMAZING PHONE, BELIEVING IN THE SERVICE OF FLIPKART DEY WOULD DELIEVER IN 10-20 DAYS.

      1.GORILLA GLASS
      
      2: INTERNAL MEMORY
      
      3: PPI
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1;NO EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD SLOT ,U WILL E REGRETTING LATER AFTER BUYING MOTO G COZ MOTO IS GIVE ONLY 1 GB FOR APPLICATION ,HOW CAN U PLAY A GAME LIKE ASPHALT RACING,REAL RACING WHICH ARE OVER 1.5GB? WHAT IS THE USE OF QUADCORE PROCESSOR IF U DONT USE THAT EFFICIENCY?
      
      
      2:NON REMOVABLE BATTERY,WHAT IF THE BATTERY GONE DEAD AFTER FEW MONTHS,WILL U THROUGH AWAY THE MOBILE?
      
      
      3: THE CAMERA THEY SAID WAS 5MP ,WAS NOT UPTO D MARK ITS JUST LIKE 3.2MP.COMPARE THIS WITH SAMSUNG 5MP CAMERA ,THIS IS VERY BAD CAMERA WE CANT SHOOT GOOD PICTURES WITH THIS CAMERA ,LAG BETWEEN THE CONSECUTIVE SHOTS IS TOO HIGH
      
      
      4: IF U LOOK AT THE CHIPSET OF QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON 400,THE CPUBOSS IS JUST GIVEN IT 6 RATING OUT OF 10.THEN U MUST THINK OF THIS
      
      
      COMAPARED TO PRICE,SCREEN,CAMERA,PROCESSOR, VIDEO RECORDING RESOLUTION MICROMAX CANVAS HD IS WAY BETTER AND ITS PRICE IS JUST 10.5K"

Moto G,3,"MOTOROLA ISN'T LISTENING AND THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE. AFTER DISCONNECTING USB OR CHANGING SETTING ON / OFF ON STORAGE MTP, THE BATTERY IMMEDIATELY DROPS TO 1%.
      
      THIS IS HAPPENING IN US,UK AND INDIA TOO. I GOT MY PHONE 2 DAYS BACK AND TESTED AND YES IT DOES HAPPEN. THE BATTERY READING GOES WRONG ONCE YOU ENABLE / DISABLE MTP, I'M USING MY PHONE ON 1% BATTERY LEVEL FOR 4-5 HOURS. ITS STILL ASKING TO PLUG CHARGER COZ BATTERY IS LOW BUT KEEPS WORKING SINCE BATTERY IS THERE, JUST INDICATION IS WRONG.
      
      I'LL JUST WAIT FOR BATTERY TO DROP FOR REAL SO IT SHUTS DOWN AND THEN CHARGE TO 100% AND MAYBE THEN IT WILL START SHOWING CORRECT BATTERY LEVELS. [UPDATE: THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO SOME NETWORK PROBLEM. THE CALLS WHICH EVERYONE KNOWS FLUCTUATE ON THE PHONE, THE FLUCTUATION IS THERE AND THE VOICE QUALITY ALSO GOES DOWN COZ OF IT. ON MY OTHER PHONE - MICROMAX CANVAS, THERE IS NO FLUCTUATION. PLEASE RATE THIS REVIEW AS HELPFUL AND DON'T BUY THE PHONE BLINDLY TILL MICROMAX DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT. YOU WILL REGRET BUYING WHEN YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THE PHONE EVERY 4-5 HOURS.]

TRIED WITH OTHER WALL CHARGERS ALSO. I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.
      
      
      IMMEDIATELY CALLED  FLIPKART CUSTOMER CARE AND INFORMED THE STATUS. CUSTOMER CARE TOLD ME THAT WITHIN 24 HRS I WOULD RECEIVE A CALL FROM TECHNICAL TEAM.. I HAV NOT RECEIVED ANY CONFIRMATION MESSAGE/ MAIL FROM HIM. I LOGGED IN MY FLIPKART ACCOUNT AND CLICKED ON RETURN BUTTON AND REQUESTED FOR REPLACEMENT ON 11TH FEB. RECEIVED CONFIRMATION MESSAGE AND MAIL. ON 12TH FEB., 14  MORNING RECEIVED A CALL FROM TECH SUPPORT PERSON AND ASKED ME TO DO SOME BASIC TROUBLESHOOTING. EVEN THEN THE MOBILE WAS NOT POWERED ON. SHE CONFIRMED THE REPLACEMENT OF MY PHONE.  ON 14TH FEB I RECEIVED HAND TO HAND REPLACEMENT OF MOTO G. NOT YET OPENED. THANK YOU FLIPKART FOR REPLACEMENT.
      
      
      MEANWHILE I CALLED MOTOROLA CUSTOMER CARE AND INFORMED ABOUT THE PROBLEM FACED BY ME, SHE SAID SHE ALSO RECEIVED FEW CALLS FOR THE SAME ISSUE I.E. NOT POWERING ON/BATTERY CHARGING PROBLEMS. ONE MORE THING CONFIRMED THAT MOTOROLA IS NOT PUTTING ANY SEAL FOR THE ORIGINAL BOX CONTAINING THE MOBILE. ONLY FLIPKART IS PUTTING SEAL FOR THE DISPATCH PACKING BOX ONLY. FOR THE TIME BEING PHONE WILL BE AVAILABLE ON FLIPKART NOT IN RETAIL STORES.

      SOMEONE PLEASE LET ME KNOW ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS. IS MOTOROLA OPENING UP THEIR SERVICE CENTERS AGAIN OR IS IT THE LENOVO GUYS DOING THE JOB??
      
      
      I JUST SAW SOMEWHERE THAT MOTOROLA HAS COLLABORATED WITH SOME LOCAL MOBILE SERVICE CHAIN WHICH THEY ARE PROMOTING AS THEIR AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTERS.
      
      
      SOMEONE PLEASE CONFIRM THE NEWS."
Moto G,3,PERFORMANCE WISE IT IS BEST BUT THE GORILLA GLASS QUALITY OF THIS PHONE IS VERY WORST.I BOUGHT THIS PHONE LAST WEEK.I SLEPT PHONE ABOUT 1/2 FT IT HAD BROKEN.SO PLS USE THIS PHONE BY FLIP CASE OR ANY OTHER PH PROTECTORS.
Moto G,3,"PHONE IS VALUE FOR MONEY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS PROBLEM OCCURS. I HAVE REGISTERED A COMPLAIN WITH FLIPKART, THEY GUIDED ME FOR MOTOROLA SERVICE CENTER AND THEY TOLD ME IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT WITH THE HANDSET. I INFORMED TO FLIPKART ABOUT THIS. NOW WAITING FOR THERE REPLY."

      NOT EXPECTED FROM GOOGLE PRODUCT SUCH SERVICE.

Moto G,3,"THE DEVICE IS FINE. I ORDERED FOR DEVICE AND ITS BACK COVER. BUT FLIPKART SHIPPED ME ONLY DEVICE BUT TOOK TOTAL MONEY FOR RS, 13308.  AFTER MANY COMPLAINTS SOME TIMES SAYS RETURN THE PRODUCT/WE WILL SENT BACK COVER WITHIN 3 OR 4 DAYS/WE ARE REFUNDING YOUR MONEY....
      
      YET NONE OF THE ABOVE CONFIRMED BY THEM...
      
      THE DEVICE IS AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED TO 4.4.2 (KIT KAT). I LIKED IT... I AM NOT GETTING PROTECTIVE COVER IN THE MARKET. I REQUEST FLIPKART TO MAKE AVAILABLE THESE IN THEIR STORE.  (NOT TO SHOW NOT IN STOCK/SOON IN STOCK)."
Moto G,3,THE FONE IS AWESOME BUT THE CAMERA STOPPED WORKING RIGHT AFTER THE UP-GRADATION AND NOW THE AUTHORISED SERVICE CENTRE PEOPLE SAYS THAT ITS A HARDWARE PROBLEM. :(
Moto G,3,"THE MOBILE IS SOLD LIKE A HOT CAKE. BUT THE CAMERA QUALITY IS QUITE LOW.
      
      IT CAN ONLY USED FOR GAMING PURPOSE. HD GAMES EATS UP MORE MEMORY(RAM &AMP; ROM).  HEAVY GAMING ARMS BATTERY AS WELL.
      
      IT IS SAD, THAT BATTERY LIFE OF MOTOROLA IS WEAK; WHAT SHOULD WE NEED TO DO IF THE BATTERY DIES,
      
      
      WE ALSO, NEVER HEARD OF SERVICE STATIONS IN MOST CITIES.
      
      
      MAIN NEGATIVE POINT IS"" MOTOROLA MOBILITY ALREADY SOLD TO LENOVO"". IT MEANS IT IS TOUGH TO TAKE THE REISSUE, IF ANY ITEMS BECOME DEFECTIVE."
Moto G,3,"THE PERFORMANCE IS VERY GOOD BUT FLIPKART HAS GIVEN THE FOLLOWING FEATURE FOR MOTO G

Moto G,3,"TOPLINE STORY: ANYONE LOOKING FOR A MID-RANGE DUAL SIM ANDROID CAN BET THEIR MONEY ON THIS IF YOU DON?T WANT TO CARRY AN INDIAN OR CHINESE PHONES.
      
      
      I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW THAT LOT OF PEOPLE HAD BOOKED FOR THIS PHONE AND COULD NOT GET IT FOR LONG EVEN AFTER FULL PAYMENT TO FLIPKART. I ORDERED IT ON 23FEB WHEN I WAS IN CHENNAI AND WHEN I REACHED HYDERABAD ON 25 FEB, THE FLIP KART GUY HAD FOLLOWED ME TO DELIVER IT. I WAS BIT DISAPPOINTED WHEN I OPENED THE BOX AS I JUST FOUND ONLY THE HANDSET, A CHARGER AND AN AVERAGE HEADSET WITHOUT MICROPHONE. NO USB CABLE OR SCRATCH GUARD. SINCE MOST OF THE GOOGLE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ONLINE, IT?S DIFFICULT TO FIND ACCESSORIES-ESPECIALLY SCRATCH GUARD AND COVERS. I USED MY SAMSUNG USB CABLE AND THE PHONE WAS CONNECTING TO MY LAPTOP; BUT THE CHARGING WAS TOO LOW OR NIL SOMETIMES (NO WONDER WHY USB CABLE WAS NOT PART OF THE BOX CONTENTS). THE PHONE WAS DECEPTIVELY LONGER FOR ITS DISPLAY SIZE (4.5 INCH). THE LOOK AND FEEL ON BACK SIDE OF THE PHONE WAS PREMIUM UNLIKE KOREAN PLASTICS. I AM SURE MANY PEOPLE WILL HAVE PROBLEM WITH THE CHARGER AS IT DOES NOT FIT WELL IN SOME SOCKETS.
      
      THOUGH MY FIRST MOBILE PHONE WAS OF MOTOROLA (NEARLY 1 KG IN WEIGHT) I NEVER DARED TO PICK ANOTHER MOTOROLA HANDSET FOR MORE THAN A DECADE TILL GOOGLE HAD ETCHED ITS NAME ON THIS PHONE. THE FIRST PROBLEM I FACED WAS TO SET UP THE WIFI (UNLIKE SAMSUNG AND SONY ERICSON PHONES WHICH I AM USING) IN MY OFFICE AND HOME. AFTER A LONG WHILE AND GOOGLING (WHICH IS NOT MUCH USEFUL AS SUGGESTIONS WERE TOO GENERAL AND MEDIOCRE) I FOUND MY WAY OUT. THE REST OF THE SETTINGS FELL IN LINE LIKE ANY OTHER ANDROID.
      
      
      ADS FOR THIS PHONE FOCUSED ON THE BATTERY CAPACITY AND PROMISED FULL DAY POWER WITH MAXIMUM USAGE. ON THE CONTRARY EVEN FOR MY LIMITED USAGE OF THE PHONE (I USE THEM FOR MAKING CALLS ONLY) AND WIFI ON `ALWAYS? I HAD TO RECHARGE WITHIN 6-8 HOURS.  CAMERA IS JUST AVERAGE AS REVIEWS HAD POINTED OUT. MY ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT WAS FM RADIO-THIS IS JUST A PLAIN VANILLA VERSION OF FM WHICH DOES NOT OFFER YOU TO STORE CUSTOM NAME FOR STATIONS, NO RDX, NO PLAY LIST AND YOU CANNOT LISTEN VIA YOUR SPEAKER.
      
      THE PHONE WAS SHIPPED WITH VERSION 4.3 AND WITHIN TWO DAYS I RECEIVED UPDATE NOTIFICATION AND PROMPTLY UPGRADED TO KITKAT (THE REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS PHONE MAINLY). YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK, TWITTER ETC WHICH ARE BUNDLED EVEN IN 5000 RUPEES PHONES NOW A DAYS.
      
      
      THE PIXEL STORY OF THIS PHONE (WHICH YOU READ IN ALL REVIEWS OF THIS PHONE) WAS EXAGGERATED ONE AS I FOUND THAT THE VIDEOS YOU PLAY ARE NOT VERY DISTINCT FROM BRAVIA ENGINE OR FOR THAT MATTER EVEN WHEN COMPARED TO SAMSUNG S3 MINI. BOOT UP TIME, MULTI-TASKING, STREAMING VIDEOS DID NOT PRESENT ME A EXCLUSIVE USER EXPERIENCE TO BOAST ABOUT QUALCOMM QUAD CORE.
      
      
      NOW THE FAMOUS CORNING GORILLA GLASS WHICH IS AN USP OF THIS PHONE THOUGH MAY NOT LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER SCREENS, MAY SAVE SOME EMBARRASSMENT IN THE LONG RUN AS IT PREVENTS SCRATCHES AND BREAKS. WHEN YOU BUY A PHONE ONLINE, YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT YOU CANT GET INSURANCE, HAVE FEWER PLACES FOR SERVICE CENTRES AND NO AUTHENTICATED WARRANTY CARDS"
Moto G,3,"WELL MOTOROLA HAS BEEN MY FAVOURITE PHONE, BEEN USING MOTOROLA PHONE FOR THE LAST 7YEARS. IT'S ALRDY 1.5YRS OLD FOR MY ATRIX 2 N M IN LOVED WITH DAY BY DAY. WELL THE QUESTION FOR MOTO G IS...JUST IN FEW DAYS ITS WOO MOST OF OUR MIND WITH ITS FEATURE AND HARDWARE CONFIGS....WELL THAT WAS GOOGLE: BT NOW SINCE ITS ALREADY TAKEN BY LENOVA SO IT WIT STILL REMAIN THE THE SAME MOTOROLA HAVING THE SAME HARDWARE OR ITL B LETOROLA WITH ITS OWN HARDWARE BRAND. WAS THINKING OF BOOKING THE PHONE 16GIG BUT M NOT SURE SINCE ITS TAKEN OVER BY LENOVA AS M NOT A BIG FAN OF THERE PRODUCT (NO HURT FEELING LENOVA, U GUYS ARE DOING AWESOME JOB). SO, IL TAK MY TIME CHECK THE REVIEWS OF 2ND BATCH LAUNCH OF LETOROLA MOTO G AND SEE WHETHER TO GO FOR G OR A DIFFERENT BRAND. :-)"
Moto G,3,"WOULD LIKE TO WRITE ABOUT PURE ANDROID EXPERIENCE, AS CLAIMED BY MOTO G:
      
      ON THE FIRST DAY AFTER GETTING PHONE, I UPGRADED IT TO KITKAT, DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANYTHING APART FROM LESS RAM USAGE.
      
      IN THE NAME OF PURE ANDROID EXPERIENCE, MOTO-G IS MAKING FOOL LIKE:
      
      1.	FM DOES NOT HAVE LOUD SPEAKER FACILITY.
      
      2.	MESSAGING APP DOESN'T SHOW UNREAD COUNT OF MESSAGES. (NOT WHATSAPP)
      
      3.	NO DEFAULT FILE MANAGER IS PROVIDED :( BUT I GOT FROM OTHER PHONES.
      
      4.	NO DEVELOPER OPTION IS GIVEN IN SETTINGS.
      
      5.	BY QUICK SETTINGS, IF YOU WANT TO ENABLE DATA CONNECTION, BLUETOOTH OR WIFI, IT WILL OPEN MORE SETTINGS OPTIONS AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE IT ON/OFF; INSTEAD IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DO WITH ONE TAP.
      
      6.	MOTOROLA HAS NOT SPENT ANY TIME TO MAKE IT CUSTOMIZE. I WAS EXPECTING THAT IT WILL HAVE MORE FEATURES THAN OTHER PHONE. I USED MICROMAX FOR 1 MONTH AND IT HAS MORE FEATURES THAN MOTO-G IS PROVIDING IN THE NAME OF ?PURE ANDROID?
      
      APART FROM THESE SOFTWARE ISSUES, HARDWARE IS GOOD ENOUGH :)"
Moto G,2,"ALTHOUGH FLIPKART IS THE OFFICIAL SUPPLIER FOR MOTO G RELEASE IN THE INDIAN MARKETS, I DONT THINK FILPKART IS TAKING IT SERIOUSLY.

      SOMETIMES I FEEL THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS NOT HANDLED WELL BY FLIPKART AT ALL. THEY DID NOT DESERVE IT. IN THESE SITUATIONS, WHEN ORDERS ARE GOING THROUGH THE ROOF ON THIS ONE PRODUCT. FLIPKART SHOULD SEE THAT THE WEBPAGE CAN HANDLE THE TRAFFIC AND EVERY ORDER GETS THROUGH. INSTEAD, THEY ARE FULL OF THEMSELVES.

Moto G,2,"HI, I AM PLANNING TO BUY MOTO G AND AFTER READING ALL GOOD AND BAD REVIEWS BY YOU ALL FRIENDS AND TECH GURUS, AM VERY MUCH LOOKING TO PURCHASE ONE. I AM WORRIED ABOUT IT'S AFTER SALES SUPPORT. I MEAN MOTOROLA IN THE PAST HAD COME IN INDIA, SOLD IT'S PRODUCTS AND RAN AWAY. AGAIN, THEY ARE COMING WITH A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AT AN UNBEATABLE PRICE. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD SUCCEED ONLY IF THEY HAVE PROPER AFTER SALES SUPPORT THAT CAN ATLEAST MATCH UP WITH THOSE OF NOKIA AND SAMSUNG. I NOW SEEK AN EXPLANATION ON THE SAME."
Moto G,2,"HI..GOT THE PRODUCT BEFORE THE SPECIFIED DELIVERY DATE..
      
      WIFI IS NOT GETTING CONNECTED AND REPORTED THE SAME TO FK CUSTOMER CARE.GOT A RESPONSE THAT MANY OTHER USERS ARE FACING THE SAME ISSUE AND THE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED BY A SOFTWARE UPDATE.
      
      DOES ANY OTHER FACE THE SAME ISSUE/ ANY OTHER ISSUES IN MOTO G ?"
Moto G,2,"HII EVERYONE,
      
      
      THIS IS A QUESTION TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED THEIR MOTO G TILL DATE EVEN AFTER ORDERING IT ON OR AFTER 19TH FEB..
      
      
      WHICH MODE OF PAYMENT U GUYS OPTED FOR ?
      
      
      PLZ TAKE SOME TIME OUT AND REPLY TO RAJNEESH@OUTLOOK.IN
      
      
      THANKS!!"
Moto G,2,"HONE IS OK...
      
      BUT IN MY OPINION..
      
      DON'T GO FOR A NON-REMOVABLE BATTERY PHONE....
      
      WHEN PHONE GET HANG'S, YOU CANNOT REMOVE THE BATTERY...
      
      YOU CANNOT CARRY EXTRA BATTERY...
      
      WHEN BATTERY DIE AFTER COUPLE OF YEARS, YOU CANNOT REPLACE IT...YOU HAVE TO SEND THE PHONE TO MANUFACTURER FOR BATTERY REPLACEMENT BUT THAT WILL COST YOU MORE."
Moto G,2,"I AM NOT GETTING WHY NO ONE HAVE MENTIONED YET, THE BIGGEST ISSUE OF MOTO G.
      
      ANY WAY I AM USING MOTOG 16GB AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY EXP.
      
      I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU PROS.. THAT YOU CAN FIND IN OTHER REVIEWS.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1)BIGGEST ISSUE IS YOU CAN'T TRANSFER/SHARE AUDIO FILES FROM YOU DEVICE.
      
      I MEAN IT IS JUST UNEXPECTED ISSUE.
      
      AND WHEN I ASKED TO SUPPORT THEY SAID IT IS THE WAY MOTO G WORKS.
      
      TOTALLY BULLSHIT.
      
      
      2)YOU WILL GET 12 GB OF MEM. FOR USE.
      
      
      3) MORE THAN 50% OF YOUR RAM IS ALWAYS OCCUPIED WITH INBUILT APPS.
      
      
      THIS ARE THE MAIN ISSUES.
      
      THINK ON IT BEFORE YOU BUY."
Moto G,2,I BOOKED MOTO G 2DAYS BACK I WAS WAITING WIT LOTS OF EXPECTATIONS TODAY I GOT 27/2/14 PHONE DOSENT HAVE EXTERNAL MEMORY SLOT AND THEY DIDNT GIVEN DATA CABLE  PHONE IS NOT UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS IT DOSENT  GOT ANY NEW FEATURES ITS JUST AVERAGE MOBILE. FLAP PHONE :(

      AND LOOKS LIKE THERE IS NO WAY OF FIXING IT BUT TO SEND A REPLACEMENT FOR THE PHONE..
      
      
      HAS ANYONE ELSE FACED THIS PROBLEM?"
Moto G,2,"I HAD UPGRADED TO KITKAT AND AFTER THEN I AM FACING THE NETWORK COVERAGE ISSUE. I HAD ENQUIRED FLIPKART AND WAITING FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT PERSON TO HELP ON THIS. THE NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDER CONFIRMED IT'S PROBLEM WITH HANDSET AND EVEN I CAN SEE FRIENDS USING THE SAME NETWORK IN OTHER MOBILE IS GETTING A FULL NETWORK COVERAGE.
      
      
      LETS HOPE FOR BEST FROM TECHNICAL TEAM."
Moto G,2,"I HAVE BOOKED MOTO-G, BUT IT SEEMS THERE WOULD BE A DELAY IN DELIVERY. HAPPY TO WAIT AND SEE IF THEY CAN DELIVER BEFORE THE UPDATED DELIVERY DATES"
Moto G,2,I HAVE ORDERED ON 14TH FEB 2:32 PM AND TILL NOW THERE IS NO UPDATE ON MY SHIPMENT PAGE. I CAN MANY USERS HAVE GOT DELIVERED WITHIN8 DAYS. WHY THIS DIFFERENCE ? YOU SHOULD SERVE FIRST COME FIRST BASIS
Moto G,2,"I HAVE ORDERED THE PRODUCT ON 14TH FEB., BUT STILL NO PROGRESS ON ORDER., IS THAT FLIPKART HAVING MILLIONS OF ORDER OF MOTO G SO THEY CANT DELIVER. IF THEY CANT THEN DONT TAKE ORDERS.
      
      I HAVE CONTACT SUPPORT SYSTEM THEY SAID WAIT FOR 10 DAYS.

Moto G,2,"I HAVE RECEIVED THE PRODUCT SUPER FAST.
      
      THANKS TO FLIPKART.
      
      THE MOTO G I RECEIVED IS SHOWING SOME FUNNY RESULTS LIKE SUDDEN NETWORK DROP.
      
      I MAY HAVE TO REMOVE AND INSERT SIM CARD/RESTART THE HANDSET FOR A COUPLE OF TIMES TO GET IT RUNNING. SPEAKER CLARITY IS SUPERB."
Moto G,2,"I HAVE USUALLY HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE ON FK AND THIS WAS NO DIFFERENT....
      
      NO COMPLAINTS WITH THE PHONE AS ITS A GREAT OPTION FOR 14K...NICE SCREEN SIZE, WITH GOOD INTERFACE....BATTERY IS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTING AS I NEED TO CHARGE IT TWICE IN A DAY ON USAGE OF APPS.....CAMERA'S NOT THAT GREAT BUT WHAT DO U EXPECT IN 14K....ALL IN ALL A GREAT EXPERIENCE....."
Moto G,2,I ORDERED MOTO G 16GB VERSION ON 6TH FEB AND THEY PROMISED TO DELIVER IT BY 10TH FEB. NOW I GOT AN EMAIL SAYING THAT IT WILL BE DELIVERED ON 17TH FEB.WHAT IS THIS SOME JOKE?I MEAN YOU NEED 11 DAYS TO DELIVER A PRODUCT?TRULY DISAPPOINTING.
Moto G,2,"I RATHER FOUND ONE TRICK HELPFUL. AS SOMEONE SAID TO BOOK FROM ANOTHER ACCOUNT, AS A GUEST USER I DID.
      
      I BOOKED FROM MY PRIMARY ACCOUNT ON 16TH FEB. AND WAITED FOR 8 DAYS, YES. THEN ON 23RD I BOOKED AGAIN AS A GUEST USER AND THEN CREATED AN ACCOUNT.
      
      I GOT A ""ITEMS SHIPPED"" MESSAGE ON 24TH FEB FOR THE ORDER I PLACED ON 23RD FEB.
      
      CRAZY HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. MEANWHILE THE ORDER THAT I PLACED ON 16TH WAS GOING THROUGH PACKING AND WAS ALMOST GOING TO SHIPPING STAGE AND I CANCELLED IT.
      
      GOING TO RECEIVE MY SHIPMENT ON 26TH.
      
      I WOULD SUGGEST OTHERS WHO ARE ALSO WAITING, TRY THIS TRICK. U MIGHT RING THE BELLS.
      
      THE CELLPHONE IS UNDOUBTEDLY VERY DESIRABLE, AND I WANT IT BAD. BEEN WAITING SINCE NOVEMBER.
      
      THANK YOU."
Moto G,2,"I RECIEVED THIS PHONE ON 18TH AFTER 10 DAYS OF BOOKING. IN 3 DAYS I HAD TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR 7 TIMES. THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE NOTIFICATION LIGHT AND CONTACTED CUSTOMER SUPPORT. THEY TOLD TO UPDATE. DID THE UPDATE . TRIED TO CONNECT TO A LAPTOP HAVING WIN 8 OS. DEVICE GETTING  DETECTED BUT DRIVER PROBLEM. THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SUGGESTED TO USE ANOTHER USB CABLE-(GREAT SUGGESTION). THE PHONE WAS WORKING FIN WITH WIN 7. NO IDEA WHY THIS DRIVER PROBLEM IS THERE WITH WIN 8. AND THAT IS NOT YET SORTED OUT. AND AGAIN THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT WAS CONTACTED AND SUGGESTED TO ENABLE USB DEBUGGING AND CONNECT. THIS WS THE WORST PART THAT THE BATTERY DROPPED FROM 51% TO 0 ALL OF A SUDDEN. AND THE CUSTOMER CARE IS STILL UNABLE TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES..
      
      THE PHONE IS GOOD WITH REGARD TO THE FEATURES AND SPECIFICATION BUT THESE KIND OF PROBLEMS NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED ANS SORTED OUT FIRST.
      
      
      TO ADD TO THE ABOVE PROBLEMS, MY PHONE STARTED TO RESTART AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AT LAST I WENT TO THE SERVICE CENTRE. THERE IT WAS LIKE BEATING AROUND THE BUSH AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO HELP AND FINALLY THEY ASKED ME TO CONTACT FLIPKART AND ASK FOR EXCHANGE. I CALLED AND SUBMITTED A REQUEST FOR THE SAME AND HAD TO LEAVE MY PHONE IN THE SERVICE CENTRE AS THEY SAID THEY NEED MORE TIME.
      
      THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE MOTO G IN 3 DAYS AND ON THE THIRD DAY IT IS IN THE SERVICE CENTRE. I DON KNOW WHETHER IT IS THE PROBLEM OF DEVICE OR DEFECTIVE PIECES ARE BEING SHIPPED. ANYWAYS WAITING FOR THE RESPONSE FROM FLIPKART.
      
      
      REQUESTD FOR A CALL FROM FLIPKART RETURN DEPARTMENT AND EVEN  AFTER 34 HOURS THERE IS NO RESPONSE FROM FLIPKART. WHENEVER THIS ISUUE IS BEING PRESENTED TO FLIPKART CUSTOMER SERVICE THRU CHAT OR CALL THE ONLY REPLY IS THE ISSUE HA BEEN ESCALATED. EXTREMELY IRRITATING AND UNETHICAL BUSINESS BY FLIPKART.

Moto G,2,"I'M A FIRST TIME ANDROID USER. I KNEW THERE IS ONLY AS MUCH MONEY CAN BUY WHEN YOU PAY 14K FOR A PHONE. BUT BEING MOTOROLA AND GOOGLE TIE UP I WAS EXPECTING SOME BASIC HYGIENE. THE PHONE I RECEIVED SEEMED VERY JUSTIFIABLE FOR ITS WEIGHT AND LOOKS, THE GOOGLE APP STORE HAS EVERY APP YOU WANT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE USED ON A BLACKBERRY OR AN IPHONE. THE SOUNDS QUALITY IS EXCELLENT AND DISPLAY SIZE IS GOOD. BUT WITHIN FEW DAYS OF USE I STARTED TO NOTICE HEAVY FLICKERING IN MY SCREEN. WHICH WAS ODD SINCE I HAVEN'T ONCE DROPPED MY PHONE AND HAVEN'T EVEN EXHAUSTED 20% OR MEMORY SPACE ON THE PHONE? THEN THE PROBLEM GREW AND GREW AND GREW. IT'S BEEN AN IRRITATING WEEK AND HALF CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM. DESPITE MULTIPLE PHONE RESTARTS THERE SEEMS TO BE NO CHANGE. IN FACT THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE!"

BUT IF SOME ONE WILL ASK THAT WOULD YOU BUY THIS PHONE I WILL SIMPLY SAY NO BECAUSE MOTOROLA DO NOT HAVE ANY SERVICE CENTRE IN INDIA. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH THIS THEN WHAT WOULD I DO........SO I WILL SAY NOT TO BUY UNTIL IT HAS A SERVICE CENTRE IN INDIA....
Moto G,2,"ORDERED MY PHONE ON 6TH FEB. GOT IT ON 7TH VIA NEXT DAY DELIVERY.
      
      5/5 FOR THE REST OF THE FEATURES AT THIS PRICE POINT.
      
      
      OVERALL AM DISAPPOINTED WITH FLIPKART ..WHY?
      
      
      1. THE OUTER BOX IT CAME IN WAS TORN FROM ONE OF THE SIDES; OUTER BOX WAS CRUSHED AND THE ORIGINAL PHONE'S BOX WAS INTACT BUT A CRUSH MARK WAS VISIBLE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX.  I ASKED THE DELIVERY BOY ABOUT ITS CONDITION AS TO WHY..TO WHICH THE DELIVERY BOY SAID ""SIR AGGAR KOI PROBLEM HOGI TOH REPLACE HO JAYEGA"". I ASKED HIM AGAIN *PUZZLED* TO WHICH HE REPLIED ""SIR PECHAY SE HE AISE AYA HAI..HUM TOH BUS DELIVER KARTE HAI"".
      
      NOTHING TO SAY HERE.. :/
      
      
      2. NOTIFICATION LED AT THE TIME OF CHARGING, MISSED CALLS DOESN'T WORK.
      
      
      3. WHEN I OPEN/CLOSE THE CAMERA APP. THERE IS A MECHANICAL CLICK SOUND WHICH COMES OUT NEAR THE CAMERA. ITS LOUDER AT THE TIME OF CLOSING THE APP.
      
      
      4. IF THE PHONE IS SWITCHED OFF AND I PUT IT ON CHARGING THEN IT AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES ITSELF ON. ALSO, IF WHILE IN CHARGING I SWITCH OFF THE PHONE IT ACTS AS IF IT WAS RESTARTED.
      
      
      ALL I CAN GUESS IS SOMETHING WENT WRONG AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT.
      
      WAITING FOR IT TO RETURN IN STOCK SO THAT I CAN PUT IT UP FOR REPLACEMENT :(
      
      
      UPDATE: SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IT TO COME BACK IN STOCK AFTER ALL THE FALSE INFORMATION BEING PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER(S) AND NOW WAITING FOR A REFUND TO ORDER A MOTO G AGAIN.
      
      @FK IF I WON'T GET MY ORDER DELIVERED THIS TIME WITH A PROPER PACKAGING AND A ""NON-DEFECTIVE"" ITEM UNLIKE MY PREV. ORDER THEN I WILL NEVER EVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM FLIPKART AGAIN."
Moto G,2,"PLACED ORDER ON 12 FEB BUT STILL WAITING FOR PRODUCT.
      
      GREEN TRACKING POINTER IS STILL WHERE IT WAS ON 12 FEB I.E STARTING ."
Moto G,2,POOR EXECUTION OF ONLINE MARKETING CAMPAIGN WITHOUT ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL DEMAND. FLIPKART SHOULD EXTEND THE OFFER FOR ANOTHER DAY FOR 16 GB MODEL WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE AS THEIR IS NO EXTERNAL SD CARD SLOT
Moto G,2,"PRODUCT DELIVERED WELL ON TIME AND PERFECTLY PACKAGED BY FLIPKART- NO ISSUES THERE.
      
      
      MOTO G IS A GREAT VALUE MONEY PHONE, TILL IT WORKS! THE PHONE JUST DIED ON ME YESTERDAY. I TRIED TO RECHARGE IT OVERNIGHT, BUT NOW IT WILL JUST NOT START!!! IT IS NOT EVEN A MONTH OLD :(
      
      
      WILL BE GETTING IN TOUCH WITH MOTOROLA SERVICE CENTRE LATER TODAY - WILL POST UPDATES."
Moto G,2,"SO FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I WENT AGAINST MY RULE OF NOT BUYING ELECTRONICS ITEM ONLINE. AFTER GETTING SO MANY GOOD REVIEWS OF WS RETAIL I THOUGHT OF TAKING RISK. SO I ORDERED MUCH RESPECTED PHONE MOTO G.
      
      
      BOOKED ON LAUNCH DAY! ( YEAH I AM ONE OF THE FEW LUCKY ONES ). BUT GOT IT AFTER 7 DAYS. OK NO PROBLEMS. BUT I FOUND MY PHONE HAS A LEAKED PIXEL, MEANS AT A PARTICULAR POINT ON SCREEN SOME  PIXEL LOOKS BRIGHTER , AND ITS DERIVING ME CRAZY !! .  DO CHECK YOURS. I GOOGLED ABOUT IT AND VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE GOT MOTO G WITH LEAKED PIXEL.( YEAH I AM ONE OF THOSE UNLUCKY ONES. ) . I HOPE AFTER REPLACEMENT I GET A BETTER PHONE AND I DON'T HAVE TO REGRET TO BREAK MY RULE."
Moto G,2,THANK GOD I DID NOT RUSH TO BUY THIS PHONE. NO EXPANSION SLOT IS A DEAD END TO ME EVEN THOUGH ALL OTHER FEATURES ARE TOP NOTCH PERHAPS. I AM SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT READ THIS CAVEAT. IT IS NOT MENTIONED CLEARLY IN THE ADVERTISEMENT TOO.
Moto G,2,"THE PHONE IS GOOD TO LOOK AT. THE FEATURES ARE GOOD. BUT THE BATTERY CHARGING, PERFORMANCE OF BATTERY IS NOT GOOD. CAMERA IS NOT GOOD. CALL QUALITY IS NOT GOOD."
Moto G,2,"THE SINGLE SIM PHONE SOLD IN OTHER COUNTRIES IS EXCELLENT QUALITY, BUT I HAVE THE DUAL SIM VERSION LAUNCHED IN INDIA AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T RESPOND FOR A WHILE AND THEN RE-BOOTS. INITIAL I THOUGHT THIS PROBLEM MAY ONLY BE WITH THIS SET AND RE-INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT ONE OF MY FRIEND FROM BANGALORE ALSO FACING THE SAME PROBLEM. I HOPE MOTOROLA COME-UP WITH A SOLUTION TO THIS BUG IN THE COMING DAYS OTHERWISE WILL BE A TEDIOUS WORK TO CLAIM WARRANTY AS THEY DON'T HAVE A BIG SERVICE CENTER PRESENCE IN INDIA."
Moto G,2,"THERE IS NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY OPTION (NO MEMORY CARD).8 GB OR 16 GB WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH,IF THAT SPACE IS ENOUGH FOR U ITS YOURS CHOISE.ITS NOT FOR ME,ON THE OTHER SIDE AS PER PRICE PHONE IS GOOD BUT CANT RELY ON THE COMPANY ,WHETHER SERVICES WILL BE GOOD AND WARANTY , CAN BE ANOTHER MICROMAX OR PANASONIC,JUST TO MAKE MONEY."
Moto G,2,THERE IS NO SLOT TO INSERT A MICRO SD CARD TO EXPANDE THE MEMORY....SO THE MEMORY AVAILABLE IS OF 8GB OR 16GB
Moto G,2,"THIS IS ALL MARKETING STUNT BY FLIPKART THEY WERE AWARE OF THE POPULARITY OF THIS PHONE ,SO DID THEY ONLY BOUGHT 1000 PIECES FROM MOTOROLA COMMON GUYS DON'T PLAY WITH THE EMOTIONS OF YOUR LOYAL CONSUMERS"

      NOW THE MAIN POINT OF MY MAIL IS WHY ARE YOU NOT PROVIDING ITS ORIGINAL FLIP COVERS FOR THE CONSUMERS. I HAVE NOW TWO MOTO G BOTH WITHOUT ANY COVER. BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE TO PROVIDE THE MOTO G SO ITS YOU RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE ITS ACCESSORIES TWO .
      
      I AM DESPIRATELY LOOKING FOR ITS COVER FROM A LONG TIME BUT ITS STILL OUT OF STOCK FROM ITS LAST AVALABILTY .
      
      
      TODAY WHEN I OPEN FLIPKART TO CHECK THE AVAILABILTY OF FLIP COVER I SEE THAT BLACK ONE IS AVAILABLE AS OUT OF STOCK TAG IS NOT HANGING WITH IT. AT THAT TIME I QUICKLY CLICK TO ORDER IT BUT WHEN IT OPEN IT IS IS SHOWING IT IS OUT OF STOCK. THEN I CALL TO YOUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND THEY TOLD ME THAT WE ARE ONLY A INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER AND WE ARE NOT PROCURE THE MOTO G ITS SELLER WS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DELAY AND THIS TIME IT IS A WEBSITE ERROR WHICH SHOWING THAT IT IS IN STOCK BUT ACTUALLY IT IS OUT OF STOCK AND WE DOT KNOW WHEN ITS COMES BACK IN STOCK.
      
      
      FLIPKART PLEASE UNDERSTAND WE DOT KNOW WHO IS WS SELLER WE KNOW FLIPKART FOR WHICH WE PAY.
      
      PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED IMAGE FOR PROOF WHAT I FACE TODAY.
      
      
      AS A RESPECTED AND GENUINE ONLINE SHOPPING PROVIDER I THINK THAT FLIPKART WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAYING AND ALSO WHAT BEST SOLUTION FOR THAT.
      
      
      MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY DESPIRATELY SEARCHING THE MOTO G FLIP COVER ON OTHER SITE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT TELLING WHEN ITS COME BACK. IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE ON OTHER SITE BEFORE YOU NO BODY CAN PURCHASE FROM YOU SITE AS YOU ARE PLAYING WITH THE CUSTOMER WHO ALREADY BUY MOTO G FROM YOU. YOU ARE JUST BUSY TO TAKING NEW MOTO G ORDER FROM NEW CUSTOMER AND COMPLETELY IGNORING THE CUSTOMER WHO ALREADY PURCHASE THE MOTO G AND DEMANDING ITS ACCESSORIES.
      
      
      IT IS REQUEST TO YOU PLEASE UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND DO THE NEEDFUL ASAP"
Moto G,1,"FLIPKART, I WANT TO SAY THAT I ORDERED MOTO G 16 GB MOBILE ON 17 FEB AND STILL WAITING MOTO G , PLEASE DELIVERED OTHER WISE I AM PLANING TO BUY NOKIA X  NEW ANOD LAUNCH.
      
      
      PLEASE SUGGEST ME THE REAL USER OF MOTO G IS EXCELLENT OR JUST GETTING REVIEW."
Moto G,1,"HAI FLIPKART, IAM INTERESTED TO BUY THIS MOBILE BUT IAM AFRAID ABOUT ""SOME PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING FAULTY DEVICES(NOT WORKING)"". SO, I THINK MOTOROLA WAS NOT TESTING THE MOBILES BEFORE
      
      DISPATCHING, Y"
Moto G,1,"HAS DECENT SPECS , LOOKS GOOD , DESIGN IS FINE , BUT THE QUALITY IS NOT UPTO THE MARK I WOULD SAY HERE IS WHY
      
      
      1.QUALITY OF CHARGER LOOKS CHEAP AND TAKES AGES TO CHARGE THE PHONE N TRUST ME 3HRS FOR A FULL CHARGE BUT IT DISCHARGES/ BATTERY GETS OVER LIKE ANY OTHER ANDROID 4-5INCH PHONE
      
      MAY BE ITS JUS THE PHONE I RECEIVED I DUNNO BUT I COULD CLEARLY MAKE OUT THE DIFFERENCE
      
      2.WAS DELIVERED WITH A FAULTY SIM SLOT YES AFTER 10 DAYS OF WAIT I GET A FAULTY PHONE
      
      SENT IT BACK
      
      3.HEADPHONE PROVIDED IS VERY CHEAP ALMOST NON USABLE
      
      4.NO USB DATA CABLE PROVIDED WHAT IF THIS WAS MY FIRST ANDROID/SMARTPHONE
      
      
      SO OVERALL YOU WOULD NEED TO SPEND ATLEAST 3-4K MORE DEPENDING ON YOUR TASTE
      
      YOU WOULD STILL NEED TO BUY AN
      
      1.HEADPHONE WITH MIC
      
      2.USB DATA CABLE
      
      3.BODY CASE [ COLORED ] OR A PROTECTIVE CASE
      
      
      ALSO CONSIDER THIS -&GT; SINCE THEY ARE PROVIDING THE PHONE SO CHEAP [ CONSIDERING THE SPECS ] THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT/ MATERIAL USED IS NOT REALLY UP THE MARK
      
      ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS GOOD ON PAPERS
      
      THE ACTUAL DEVICE SEEMS TO BE AN ILLUSION
      
      OR
      
      BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND THEIR QUALITY CHECK ISNT BEING 100PERCENT
      
      
      I WOULD SAY WAIT IT OUT FOR COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN THE 1ST SET OF DEFECTIVE DEVICES ARE WASHED AWAY FROM THE STOCK AND MOTO SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIX THE ISSUE FOUND [ HARDWARE WISE ] THE 2ND BATCH OF PHONES MANUFACTURED SHOULD BE MUCH BETTER I WOULD SAY
      
      
      THANKS FOR READING HOPE IT HELPS SOMEONE"

Moto G,1,"HI ALL,
      
      
      AFTER USING MOTO G FOR 10 DAYS, THE REVIEW IS HERE BELOW:
      
      MY MOTO G IS AT PRESENT AT SERVICE CENTER... IT WAS SWITCHED OFF ALL OF A SUDDEN AND WAS NOT SWICTHING IT ON. MANY HAS FACED THE SAME ISSUE. EVEN AFTER WAITING FOR LONG (8 HOURS). IT WAS NOT SWITCHING ON, AT THE END I HAD TO GO TO THE SERVICE CENTRE FOR REPAIRING. IT ALL STARTED HAPPENING AFTER UPGRADING TO KITKAT.
      
      EVEN IF IT IS A BEST LOW PRICED SMARTPHONE, 13999 RUPEES IS ALSO A MONEY. WHICH I CAN'T SEE WASTED. JUST WITHIN 10 DAYS?? GOD! REPLACEMENT WON'T SIMPLY IMPREE ME NOW. WHAT WILL I DO WITH THAT KNOWING THAT IT WILL BE NOT WORKING VERY SOON.
      
      READERS PLEASE NOTE ITS A EXCELLENT SMARTPHONE BUT LACKS IN BATTERY N SAME DESTROYS ALL OTHER SPECIALLITY OF THE SMARTPHONE.
      
      FINALLY HAD TO SEND IT BACK TO FLIPKART... WORST EXPERIENCE.. ALL THOUGH THIS PROBLEM IS NOT YET SEEN IN OTHERS HANDSET IN INDIA.. HOPE ALL YOUR HANDSETS WORKS WELL.."
Moto G,1,"HI ALL,
      
      
      I GOT MOTO-G -16GB TODAY AFTER A LONG TIME, BUT IT'S STRONGLY DISAPPOINTED TO ME.
      
      
      THE MOTO-G CHARGER IS NOT AT ALL WORKING ! THIS IS PATHETIC.
      
      AS THEY DON'T PROVIDE THE USB CABLE AS WELL ALONG WITH THIS PACK, I COULD NOT ABLE TO CHARGE THE PHONE.
      
      
      WHEN I TRIED TO CHARGE THE MOBILE, IT'S NOT GETTING CHARGED. I AM NOT SURE IT'S BATTERY ISSUE OR CHARGER ISSUE.
      
      
      IMMEDIATELY I HAVE CALLED CUSTOMER CARE AND REPORTED THE ISSUE AND FOLLOWED BY I HAVE CANCELED THE ORDER."
Moto G,1,"HI FLIPKART,

Moto G,1,"HII ALL, I ORDERED MOTO G 16 GB ON 12TH FEB, GOT DELIVERED ON 21ST FEB. TILL WAT I USED ..
      
      I FOUND THE CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY POOR, AND WIFI IS NOT WORKING,,IT FINDS THE NETWORK, BUT DOES NOT CONNECTS........IT KEEPS ON TELLING THAT OBTAINING I.P ADDRESS AND NEVER CONNECTS..
      
      SO, THINK WISELY,,RIGHT NOW,,I M VERY MUCH FRUSTATED WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      ALSO, THE WIFI HOTSPOT CREATED THROUGH YOUR LAPTOP..THIS PHONE IS UNABLE TO CATCH IT, EVEN WHEN IN 3 METERS DISTANCE.
      
      DIDNT EXPECTED THIS FROMM MOTOROLA.."
Moto G,1,"I AM RETURNING THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE UNAVAILABILITY OF ACCESSORIES THAT ARE OFFERED 70% OFF ON LAUNCH DAY...FROM DAY ONE ON WARDS IT STILL SHOWS OUT OF STOCK...... HOW LONG IT WILL BE????...YOU ARE LITERALLY CHEATING YOUR CUSTOMERS...IF YOU COULD NOT KEEP YOUR PROMISE WHY SHOULD WE BENEFIT YOU BY BUYING FROM YOU RATHER I PREFER OTHER PHONES TO CONSIDER AS THIS ONE IS NOT AVAILABLE ON OTHER MARKET. I CONTACTED THROUGH EMAIL...THEY SIMPLY SAID SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH YOUR SORRY...I NEED WHAT YOU PROMISED.
      
      FOLKS TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERNS....THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE TO REVIEW ON THE SERVICE, HENCE WRITING HERE...OTHERWISE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT WITHING IT'S BUDGET RANGE"
Moto G,1,"I GOT THE MOTO G ON LAST FRIDAY (21 FEB,14), WHEN I SWITCHED ON THE PHONE I SAW A DEAD PIXEL ON THE SCREEN. I INFORMED FK WITH IN TWO HOURS AFTER DELIVERY AND ALSO SEND A MAIL REGARDING THAT, BUT TILL TODAY NO ONE FROM FK CONTACTED ME,FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS I AM GETTING THE SAME REPLY FROM THE EXECUTIVE/SUPERVISOR THAT ""THE TECHNICAL EXPERT WILL CALL YOU TOMORROW""
      
      I THINK THEY ARE TOO BUSY SOLVING THE ISSUES WITH OTHER BUYERS WHO ARE USING THIS PHONE....
      
      
      I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS PRODUCT, :(     TO THE NEW BUYERS I WOULD SAY WAIT FOR SOME MORE TIME,
      
      MOTOROLA(GOOGLE/LENOVO) MAY SELL THIS PRODUCT THROUGH OTHER SELLERS , AT LEAST WE CAN EXPECT BETTER SERVICE FROM THEM."
Moto G,1,I GOT THIS PRODUCT AND IN ONLY 3 DAYS IT GOT BROKEN .BY MISTAKE IT GOT SLIPPED FROM MY HAND JUST FROM ABOUT 2.5 FEET AND ITS SCREEN GOT A BIG CRACK ON IT I NEVER EXPECTED THAT ITS DURABILITY IS SO LOW EVERY THING ON SCREEN IS WORKING JUST THERE IS A BIG CRACK ON IT .SO I WANT TO TELL IT TO ALL BUYERS OF THIS PRODUCT THAT BE CAREFUL WHILE USING IT COZ ITS SCREEN IN NOT THAT GOOD PROTECTED ..
Moto G,1,"I HAD BOOKED MOTO G ON MON, 17TH FEB AT 07:23 PM FROM MUMBAI LOCATION AND EVEN MENTIONED DELIVERY ADDRESS AS MUMBAI. MADE MY PAYMENT THROUGH CREDIT CARD. STILL THERE IS NO WORD FROM FLIPKART ON DELIVERY. LET ALONE DELIVERY, TRACK ORDER JUST DISPLAYS ""YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN PLACED. PAYMENT ACCEPTED."". THEY EVEN HAVEN'T PROCESSED MY ORDER YET. I HAVE READ FEW REVIEWS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED THEIR MOTO G BOOKED AFTER 17TH FEB.
      
      
      IF FLIPKART IS FALLING SHORT ON MEETING DEMANDS THEN WHY ALLOW USERS TO BOOK ONE? WHY NOT CLEAR THE BACKLOG AND THEN OPEN THE BOOKINGS?"
Moto G,1,"I HAD ORDERED MOTO G 16 GB ON 11TH FEBRUARY BUT STILL ORDER STUCK TO APPROVED STATE NO SINGN OF DELIVERY. IN COMENTS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE RECEIVED THEIR PRODUCT IN MAXIMUM OF 10 DAYS THEN WHY THIS PARTIALITY TO ME???

THE VOICE QUALITY IS PATHETIC  THERE WAS SO MUCH DISTORTION, I JUST HATED IT!! THUMBS UP TO FLIPKART FOR TAKING IT BACK AND GIVING ME A FULL REFUND. SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THIS ISSUE IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THE MOTO G, CAUSE IN THE END THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF A PHONE IS TO MAKE CALLS.."
Moto G,1,"I HAVE NOT WRITTEN THIS REVIEW TO MISGUIDE ANYONE ITS WHAT I CAME ACROSS........
      
      
      I M REALLY VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FLIPKART.I ORDERED A MOTO G 16 GB VARIANT ON 14TH OF FEB VIA MY ANOTHER ACCOUNT BUT IT HAS NO PROGRESS TILL DATE.
      
      WHEREAS PEOPLE WHO HAVE ORDERED THE PHONE AFTER ME OR ON THE SAME DATE HAVE RECEIVED THEIR ORDER ALREADY.
      
      I CALLED TO THEIR CUSTOMER CARE THEY REPLIED ME THAT THEY ARE NOT SHIPPING PHONES ON FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS ACTUALLY THEY ARE SENDING THE MOBILE FIRST TO THE NEARBY AREAS OF DELHI.
      
      AND WHEN I ASKED THEM WHEN WILL THEY GOING TO SHIP ME THEY JUST TOLD THAT ITS OUT OF STOCK ...
      
      
      FLIPKART IS A LIAR

Moto G,1,"I HAVE ORDERED FOR MOTO G 16GB  (ORDER ID: OD40212053050,12 FEBRUARY, 2014 1:09 PM) AND MADE PAYMENT THROUGH NET-BANKING. EVEN AFTER 12 DAYS, THE ORDER STATUS IS SHOWING ""YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN PLACED"". NO MOVEMENT AT ALL. I FIND FROM VARIOUS REVIEWS HERE THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOOKED (OF COURSE 16GB ONES) MUCH LATER THAN ME, HAVE GOT THEIR HANDSETS... AND I GUESS THEIR ORDERS WERE ON COD BASIS.  FLIPKART DELIVERS FAST ON COD ORDERS, AS THESE ORDERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET CANCELLED IN THE EVENT OF INORDINATE DELAYS. THIS IS QUITE UNFAIR PRACTICE AND UNPROFESSIONAL WAY OF DOING BUSINESS. THIS KIND OF TREATMENT WILL TARNISH FLIPKART'S IMAGE IN LONG RUN. NO REVIEW AND NO STARS TILL I RECEIVE AND USE THE PHONE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS... BUT JUST ONE STAR FOR POOR LOGISTICS AT FLIPKART'S END."
Moto G,1,"I HAVE ORDERED MOTO G 16 GB 10 DAYS BACK , FLIPKART DELIVERED WITHIN EXPECTED TIME ( GOOD SERVICE FROM FLIPKART) , BUT FOR MY LUCK AFTER OPENING , I KEPT IT FOR CHARGING , EVEN  AFTER HOURS ALSO ITS DISPLAYING 0% ."
Moto G,1,"I HAVE ORDERED MOTO G ON FEB 14TH AND THE SAME WAS SCHEDULED TO DELIVER ON FEB 24TH, WHEN THE PRODUCT REACHED, THE FLIPKART EXECUTIVE SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT PAYMENT VIA DEBIT / CREDIT CARD AND CANCELLED THE ORDER..HENCE I HAD TO REPLACE THE ORDER."
Moto G,1,"I HAVE ORDERED ONE AND AM ABOUT GET THIS WEDNESDAY,26.02.2014 IS HEAD PHONE QUALITY GOOD CAUSE I HEARD IT NOT THAT GOOD. AND ALSO IS USB CABLE INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE, CAUSE I DIDN'T FOUND USB CABLE IN MY FRIENDS MOTOG16GB PACKET.PLEASE REPLY"
Moto G,1,"I HAVE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT ON 14,FEB 2014.
      
      I GOT THIS PRODUCT  AFTER I HAVE CONTACTED FLIPKART AND ASKED THEM ABOUT THE DELIVERIES DONE ON 18,FEB.2014  BY THEM FOR THE ORDERS WHICH GOT PLACED ON 17,FEB.2014 (I.E., AFTER 14,FEB.2014).  FINALLY I GOT THE PRODUCT ON 23,FEB.2014. SINCE, I WAS OUT OF STATION NOBODY IN MY HOME TOUCHED/CHECKED. I AM BACK TODAY (26,FEB.2014) AND TRIED TO SWITH ON THE PRODUCT BUT NO SUCCESS. TRIED TO SWITCH ON AFTER CONNECTING CHARGER BUT NO LUCK. IMMEDIATELY I RAISED RETURN REQUEST AND WAITING FOR THEM TO CONTACT ME.
      
      I AM NOT UNDERSTANDING WHETHER I CAN GO FOR OTHER MOTO G PHONE BY RETURNING THE ONE I GOT OR NOT.
      
      P.S: WHEN I SEARCHED IN GOOGLE I FOUND LOT OF REVIEWS ABOUT MOTO G BATTERY THAT WE SHOULD  NOT WAIT TILL THE CHARGING REACHES LESS THAN 10-20%. IF THE ENTIRE BATTERY DISCHARGES, BOOTING THE PHONE IS NOT POSSIBLE EVEN WE PLUG IN CHARGER, UNLESS U KEEP THE PHONE IDEAL FOR FEW HOURS. I AM NOT UNDERSTANDING WHETHER ANY BODY FACED THIS ISSUE OR NOT. I HEARED FOR SOME BODY THAT PHONE IS GETTING HEATED UP MORE WHEN PLAY/BROWSE FOR 15-20 MIN."
Moto G,1,I HAVE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT ON 17TH FEB AND HAVE YET NOT RECEIVED. THOSE WHO HAVE ORDERED AFTER ME RECEIVED WITHIN 2 DAYS. THE PROBLEM IS AFTER THE ORDER CONFIRMATION MAIL I DIDN'T EVEN RECEIVE ANY FOLLOW UP MAILS OR ANYTHING.
Moto G,1,I HAVE PLACED THE ORDER OF MOTO G ON 19 FEB 2014 AND NO FURTHER INFORMATION  IS AVAILABLE ON THIS PRODUCT NEITHER THE AVAILABILITY IS KNOWN ON THIS PRODUCT  WHETHER IT WILL AVAILABLE IN 10-20 DAYS BOUNDED TIME
Moto G,1,"I ODERED IT ON 11TH FEB 7:16 PM
      
      NO CONFIRMATION YET, PEOPLE WHO ORDERED ON 20TH HAVE GOT IT.
      
      VERY POOR MANAGEMENT. THEY SAY IT'S ON FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS. HOW THE HELL IS IT FIRST COME FIRST SERVE WHEN SOMEONE WHO ORDERED ON 20TH GOT IT BEFORE ME."
Moto G,1,"I ORDERED MOTO G ON 13TH FEB AND DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON BACKEND, FLIPKART SHOULD UPDATE THE STATUS FREQUENTLY SO CUSTOMER ONE WILL KNOW THE STATUS. WHAT IS GOING ON BACK-END."
Moto G,1,I ORDERED MOTO G ON 14TH FEB(DELHI) BUT STILL NO INFO.I AM IRRITATED WITH FLIPKART THOSE WHO HAVE ORDERED AFTER ME ARE GETTING THEIR PHONES EARLIER.WHENEVER YOU CHECK IT JUST SAYS WILL BE SHIPPED IN 10-20 DAYS SERIOUSLY THAT IRRITATES A LOT.IF ANYONE KNOWS ANYTHING PLEASE TELL ME I HAVE LOST MY OLD PHONE AND NEED THIS ONE AT THE EARLIEST.
Moto G,1,"I ORDERED MOTO G ON LAUNCH DAY. GOT IT IN 2 DAYS. GOOD SERVICE BY FLIPKART, BUT THE PHONEHAS DISAPPOINTED ME! THE TOUCH SCREEN DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY WHILE CHARGING. ESPECIALLY THE SCROLLING IS VERY BAD. IT REQUIRES LOT OF PRESSURE AND REPEATED TOUCHES TO OPERATE A SINGLE FUNCTION. THE BATTERY TAKES A LONG TIME TO CHARGE SOMEDAYS AND OTHERWISE IT CHARGES EXTREMELY FAST! FIRST DAY AFTER UPDATING TO KIT KAT, IT TOOK JUST HALF AN HOUR TO CHARGE 65%. NEXT DAY IT TOOK 3 HOURS TO CHARGE 30%. NOT CONSISTENT. EVEN BATTERY DRAINS TOO SOON :( NEVER EXPECTED THIS FROM MOTO. DISSAPPOINTED! PPL, THINK BEFORE BUYING."
Moto G,1,"I ORDERED ON 13TH OF FEB N IT WAS DELIVERED BY 25TH BUT AS SOON I TURNED ON THE DEVICE I NOTICED A DUST PARTICLE ON SCREEN WITHIN NO TIME I CONTACTED FLIPKART CUSTOMER CARE....!! YET HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEIR TECHNICAL SUPPORT WHICH IS AGAIN FRUSTRATING PART TO WAIT SO LONG FOR ABOUT 24 HOURS:( .
      
      THOUGHT THE SPOT SEEMS TINY BUT IT CATCHES MY ATTENTION N I FEEL FRUSTRATING....!!
      
      LEAVING THE DUST PARTICLE REST ALL IS JUST AWESOME....!!
      
      I SUGGEST EVERYONE TO REMOVE SCRATCHGUARD  N CHECK FOR ANY DUST PARTICLE...!!
      
      HOPE FLIPKART PROVIDE ME M REPLACEMENT ASAP...!!!!"
Moto G,1,I ORDERED ON 14 FEB TILL NOW NOT UPADATES ITEM IS STILL YET TO CONFIRM...THOSE COSTUMERS WHO ORDERED AFTER ME GOT THERE PHN BUT MINE IS STILL AT ORDER PLACED IS THAT YOUR FIRST IN FIRST OUT SERVICE.. SHAME ON YOU FLIPKART
Moto G,1,"I ORDERED THIS VERY MUCH HYPED FONE ON 11TH FEB , AND RECEIVED THIS AFTER 10 DAYS WAITING ON 20TH FEB , WE PALNNED TO GIVE IT TO OUR MOTHER ON HER BIRTHDAY AS A PRESENT BUT WHEN WE SWITCHED ON THE PRODUCT , AT FIRST PLACE IT EVEN TO SWITCH ON , THEREFORE I CANT REVIEW THE FONE , AND WHEN I APPROACHED FLIPKART WITH THE PROBLEM , THEY TOLD THAT THEY CAN REPLACE THE PRODUCT ONLY AFTER WAITING FOR IT AGAIN FOR 10-20 DAYS , IT SO HUMILIATING , YOU GIVE SOMEONE A BIRTHDAY PRESENT AND U LATER LEARN THAT THE ITEM WAS DEFECTIVE .
      
      THEREFORE GUYZ I ADVISE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WHILE ORDERING THIS FONE ONLINE , CHANCES ARE THAT YOU COULD END UP BUYING DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND THEN WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH PATHETIC CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICE"
Moto G,1,I PLACED THE ORDER FOR MOTO G 16 GB VERSION ON 18TH FEB AND THE ORDER IS STILL IN THE APPROVAL STAGE ONLY NOW I CAN GO WITH THAT AS FLIPKART HAS MENTIONED THAT THE ORDER WILL TAKE FROM 10 TO 20 DAYS. BUT GOING THROUGH THE REVIEWS SOME OF THE CUSTOMERS ARE RECEIVING THE PHONE WITHIN 4 TO 5 DAYS ONLY. SO FLIPKART SORT OUT THESE ISSUES.
Moto G,1,"I PURCHASED MOTO G ON FEB 6TH. SUDDENLY CAMERA STOPPED WORKING. I DID NOT EXPECT THIS FROM FLIPKART AND ITS VERY FIRST DATE MOBILE CAMERA STOPPED WORKING IN TWO WEEKS AND IMMEDIATELY  I WENT SERVICE CENTER NEAR MY PLACE THEY SAID PROBLEM WITH HARDWARE ONLY TRY TO CONTACT FLIPKART,I NEVER EVER EXPECT THIS FROM FLIPKART KINDLY PROVIDE ME GOOD HANDSET.I BOUGHT ON FLIPKART DUE TO ITS WELL ESTABLISHED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RETURN POLICY.KINDLY PROVIDE ME WITH NEW GOOD REPLACEMENT."
Moto G,1,"I RECEIVED MY PHONE ON 14TH FEB AND STARTED USING IT ON 19TH AS I WAS OUT OF STATION. EVER SINCE THE KITKAT UPDATE THE PHONE HAS HAD SEVERAL CONNECTION ISSUES.IT SUDDENLY LOSES NETWORK OR EVEN FAILS TO RECOGNIZE SIM. SOMETIMES THE MOBILE DATA STOPS WORKING AND IS A PAIN IN THE ASS TO GET IT WORKING AGAIN (ITS A PERFECTLY FINE SIM I RECHECKED),EVEN RESTART OR INSERTING THE SIM AGAIN DOESN'T HELP. I CALLED FLIPKART TWICE AND THEY TOLD ME TO CALL HALF AN HOUR LATER AS THEIR SERVER WAS DOWN BOTH THE TIMES(YOU'RE NOT IRCTC GUYS).
      
      WHATS WORSE IS THAT SUCH BUGS ARE HARD TO REPRODUCE WHEN YOU CLAIM THE RETURN POLICY.I'VE ALREADY RESET MY PHONE TWICE(IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY SOLUTION WHEN YOU'RE FRUSTRATED) AND ITS A PAIN TO SET UP AND DOWNLOAD ALL THE APPS AGAIN.
      
      COMPLETLY DISSATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT AND AFTER SALES SERVICE"
Moto G,1,"I USED A MICRO SIM IN THE PHONE SLOT, BUT IT GOT STUCK THERE. IT IS NOT GETTING OUT NOW.

Moto G,1,"REALLY SAD NEVER FACED THIS ISSUE WITH FLIPKART. 8 DAYS HAVE PASSED STILL NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT.  PEOPLE WHO HAVE ORDERED AFTER ME ARE RECEIVING THE PHONE, FLIPKART WHERE IS THE DELAY???
      
      PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT."
Moto G,1,"SINCE 10 DAYS THE ORDER STATUS HAS BEEN IN THE FIRST  STATE(APPROVAL) ONLY..
      
      SICK TO SEE THIS...
      
      IM REALLY
      
      
      ."
Moto G,1,THE FIRST PHONE THAT I GOT WAS WITH BLACK LINES ON SCREEN AND IT ARRIVED 3 DAYS LATER THAN THE PROMISED DATE AND EVERY MORNING THEY MESSAGED ME THAT THE PRODUCT IS READY FOR DELIVERY BY 1900 . THE REPLACEMENT TO THIS PHONE WAS WORKING FINE FOR 6 HOURS BEFORE IT STATED RESTARTING AUTOMATICALLY AGAIN AN AGAIN. AND THEIR RESPONSE FOR THE REPLACEMENT IS VERY SLOW. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AS I BELIEVE THAT THESE GUYS ARE RECIRCULATING THE DEFECTIVE PIECES IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMAND. TILL NW WAIING FOR MY MONEY BACK FOR THIS GARBGE THAT THEY SENT ME
Moto G,1,"THE PHONE BATTERY GOT DISCHARGED IN 10 MINUTES. IN SPITE OF 3 HOURS OF CHARGING, THE NOTIFICATION LIGHT DID NOT TURN ON, NEITHER DID THE PHONE. THE PRODUCT IS MADE IN CHINA FOR INDIA; CONTAINS INFO BOOKLET IN ENGLISH &AMP; HINDI ONLY. AFTER LEARNING ABOUT OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THE DISPLAY &AMP; OTHER HARDWARE PROBLEMS, I SUSPECT THE PRODUCT IS COMPROMISED IN QUALITY. ITS PROBABLY ONLY A MATTER OF TIME, WHEN WE START USING IT &AMP; REALIZE SOFTWARE PROBLEMS. THE REAL ISSUE WOULD BE THE SERVICE AFTER 30 DAYS... FEEL I MADE A MISTAKE."
Moto G,1,"THE PHONE IS EXTREMELY GOOD. EVEN WHITE CHARGER AND EAR PHONES WITH BLACK PHONE DID NOT DEPRESS ME BUT THE PACKAGING DID.
      
      FIRSTLY IT DID NOT COME IN A TAMPER PROOF PACKING. EVEN FOOT WEAR COSTING RS.500 COME IN FAR SUPERIOR PACKING THESE DAYS. BUT FLIPKART SENT MOTO G AS IF THEY WERE HOME DELIVERING 2 POUCHES OF EDIBLE OIL IN A HARD PAPER CARTON BOX  WITH ADHESIVE TAPE USED TO SEAL ALL CORNERS.
      
      
      SECONDLY, ONCE YOU OPEN THE MOTOROLA PACK THE MOTO G CAN SIMLPLY FALL OUT OF IT AS IT IS LOOSELY PLACED AT THE TOP. THE LESS PRECIOUS CHARGER &AMP; EARPHONES ARE PLACED MORE SECURELY.
      
      
      FULL MARKS TO MOTO G FOR ITS QUALITY
      
      -10 TO FLIPKART FOR THEIR HANDLING OF MOTO G."
Moto G,1,THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE DELIVERY.ORDERED ON 16TH AND GOT IT ON 19TH FEB.BUT WHEN I CHECKED THE CELL BY CALLING THE VOICE IS VERY VERY FEEBLE.THE PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE CANNOT HEAR YOU AT ALL.ALSO IF YOU PUT HANDFREE THEN NO VOICE GOES TO THE OTHER PERSON.REALLY FRUSTRATING AS THE OTHER PERSON KEEPS SAYING HELLOO HELLOO HELLOOOO.AS I CAN ALREADY SEE THE PRODUCT IS OUT OF STOCK I DONT KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE REPLACED NOW.HAD GIFTED THIS CELL TO MY MOM AND NOW SHE WILL BE WITH NO CELL AT ALL FOR A LONG TIME AS THE SIM WAS MADE MICRO WHICH IS UNSUITABLE FOR OTHER CELLS.REALLY RELYING ON FLIPKART TO REPLACE THIS FAULTY PIECE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
Moto G,1,"THIS IS MY WORST ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. FIRST OF ALL I PAYED RS 90 EXTRA TO GET IT DELIVERED NEXT DAY, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THEN I RECEIVED DEFECTIVE DEVICE WITH MISMATCH IN ACCESSORIES COLOR. AFTER COMPLAINING YOUR CC THEY ASKED ME TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.
      
      I HAVE UPDATED THE SOFTWARE TO 4.4, BY SPENDING 230 MB DATA AND 4 HRS BUT ISSUE IS NOT RESOLVED. WHEN I CONNECT THE MOBILE TO CHARGER IT TURNS OFF. I TRIED WITH OTHER CHARGER AS WE'LL BUT SAME ISSUE!
      
      I AM NOT SURE IF FLIPKART UNDERSTANDS WHEN PEOPLE BUY NEW MOBILES THEY DON'T WANT TO TROUBLE SHOOT TO MAKE IT WORK!"

Moto G,1,"WAITED FOR LAST 15 DAYS FOR MOTO G BEING AVAILABLE, BUT NOW FED UP AND JUST ORDERED IPHONE 4S .WAS BIT CONFUSED AFTER READING THE NEWS OF SELL OUT OF MOTOROLA BY GOOGLE. NOW WATCHING THE RELEASE OF MOTO G IN INDIA I THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MOTOROLA MANAGEMENT . WOULD NOT PURCHASE MOTOROLA PRODUCT IN FUTURE EVEN IF IT IS GOOD. MOTOROLA MANAGEMENT MADE A MESS OF MOTO G LAUNCH IN INDIA."
Moto G,1,"WHAT DO YOU THINK? HAS FLIPKART?S CUSTOMER SERVICE REALLY DETERIORATED OVER THE YEARS, OR WOULD YOU DISCOUNT THIS AS AGAIN ONE OF THE RARE CASES AMONG THOUSANDS OF OTHER SATISFIED FLIPKART CONSUMERS?
      
      
      I WAS NOT EXPECTING SUCH A POOR QUALITY OF SERVICE FROM FLIPKART. FROM LAST COUPLE OF DAYS I WAS COMPLETELY MISGUIDED BY YOUR CALL CENTER EXECUTIVES ABOUT THE PRODUCT . THAT TOO FOR A PROBLEM WHICH WAS CREATED DUE TO MISTAKE OF FLIPKART CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DELIVERY. (A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MENTAL HARASSMENT.)
      
      
      ISSUE IS NOT ONLY WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT ALSO WITH DELIVERY AND THEN MYSELF KEEP ON WASTING MY TIME IN CALLING CUSTOMER CENTER.
      
      
      I ASSUME IF YOU ARE ADMITTING YOUR FAULT THEN NO NEED TO PLACE A FRESH ORDER BUT SHOULD HAVE AMENDED THE ORDER. AS A CUSTOMER I DO NOT CARE WHAT YOUR INTERNAL SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS ARE OR POLICIES ARE. ETHICALLY IF I SHOULD NOT BE ASKED TO PLACE FRESH ORDER AND YOU SHOULD HAVE PROCEDURES IN YOUR ORGANISATION TO HANDLE THIS AND YOUR EXECUTIVES SHOULD BE TRAINED ENOUGH TO ORDER ACCORDINGLY.
      
      
      AND FUNNY PART IS EACH TIME YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE ISSUE TO DIFFERENT EXECUTIVE WHO WILL GIVE YOU REALLY DIFFERENT AND INCORRECT INFORMATION AND THERE IS NO POINT OF CONTACT FOR COMPLAINTS EXCEPT CUSTOMER SERVICE MAIL BOX.
      
      
      I REALLY DO NOT HAVE ANY TRUST LEFT IN YOUR ORGANISATION AND YOUR REPRESENTATIVES. I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP ME IN THIS REGARD.
      
      
      I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CONTACT DETAILS OF THE HIGHER MANAGEMENT OF FLIPKART OR DIRECT FLIPKART SENIOR EXECUTIVES THAN CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVES TO ADDRESS AND DISCUSS THIS ISSUE URGENTLY."
Moto G,1,"WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PHONE..
      
      WELL, I SOMEHOW MANAGED TO ORDER THE 16GIG IN THE AFTER NOON AS SOON AS I SAW IT AVAILABLE ON LAUNCH DAY, 6TH FEB AND IT WAS AN AWESOME FEELING..FOOLS ARE THOSE WHO ARE SCOLDING FLIP AND RATING THE PRODUCT 1, COZ THEY WERE THINKING WHETHER TO ORDER IT OR NOT WHILE OTHERS GRABBED IT IN FIRST LOOK.
      
      
      NOW, ABOUT THE PHONE THIS PHONE IS REALLY SUPERB AS MUCH AS I KNOW I RESEARCHED A LOT ABOUT IT COZ I WANT VALUE FOR MY MONEY. I WILL BE WRITING A FULL REVIEW AFTER USING IT (DELIVERY DATE IS 10TH FEB)
      
      I WAS LOOKING FOR THE PHONE THAT WILL SUIT MY NEEDED SPECIFICATIONS. FOR MORE THAN 2 MONTHS I WAS LOOKING AND WASN'T SATISFIED WITH ANY OF THE PHONE IN THE MARKET. GOOD PHONES ARE TOO COSTLY AND I WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE WHICH PHONE TO CHOOSE
      
      
      WHAT I NEEDED -
      
      1.A TOUGH RUGGED PHONE. I AM CARELESS I USUALLY CARRY KEYS IN POCKET WITH PHONE AND SCRATCHES MAKES ME FEEL THAT MY PHONE IS GETTING OLD
      
      2. GOOD BATTERY LIFE. I AM TIRED OF CHARGING MY OLD PHONE 2-3 TIMES A DAY
      
      3. FAST PROCESSOR I AM NOT THAT MUCH INTO MOBILE GAMING COZ I PREFER MY PC FOR GAMING PURPOSE STILL I NEED A GOOD RESPONSE WHEN I ORDER MY PHONE TO OPEN AN APP IT SHOULD DO IT IN BLINK OF EYE ELSE ITS DEAD MISTER.
      
      4.I ALSO NEEDED A GOOD DISPLAY AND GOOD SOUND QUALITY I LOVE MUSIC AND A LITTLE SHOW OFF AMONG FRIENDS,
      
      5 A CAMERA GOOD ENOUGH FOR CASUAL USE MOSTLY FOR INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK.
      
      
      WHAT I AM GETTING IS -
      
      
      1. CORNING GORILLA 3 PROTECTION WHICH IS SCRATCH PROOF EVEN IF YOU TRY TO SCRATCH IT WITH KEYS
      
      2. WATER RESISTANT (OOPS I ACCIDENTALLY PUT MY PHONE WITH MY CLOTHES TO WASH GOOD LORD ITS ALIVE).
      
      3. SNAPDRAGON 400 1.2 GH (I SAW REVIEWS ON YOUTUBE AND ITS ALMOST AS FAST AS NEXUS 4 THAT IS 25K SOMETIMES IT WAS FASTER THAN SAMSUNG S4 )
      
      4.DISPLAY IS AWESOME 326PIXELS PER INCH ON A 4.5 INCH SCREEN AND THAT ON AN APPLE IPHONE 4S ITS 329PPI ON A 4 INCH SCREEN IMPRESSIVE!!! MOTO G
      
      5.ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE REVIEWS IN YOUTUBE THE CALL CLARITY IN OTHER PHONES IS BETTER BUT THE NOISE CANCELLATION IN MOTO G IS BETTER SO I GUESS IT IS FOR ME COZ I MOSTLY WORK IN NOISY SURROUNDING.
      
      6. THE CAMERA IS NOT THE BEST BUT IN GOOD LIGHT IT WILL GIVE YOU DECENT IMAGES WITH BRIGHT COLORS AND IT RECORDS 720P HD SO NOTHING TO QUESTION.
      
      7. CUSTOMIZABLE COLORED COVERS WHICH WILL NEVER LET YOU FEEL BORED THE COLOR OPTIONS ARE REALLY GOOD BRIGHT AND LIVELY
      
      8.DUAL SIM - AVAIL THE BEST STD AND LOCAL OFFERS BY TWO SERVICE PROVIDERS
      
      9. THE PHONE GIVES 50 GB GOOGLE DRIVE SPACE FOR 2 YEARS
      
      10 THE PHONE IS USB OTIS COMPATIBLE YOU CAN CONNECT A 32 GB PENDRIVE IF EXTRA SPACE IS NEEDED(ALTHOUGH I DONT NEED IT I ALREADY SPENT 50K ON MY LAPTOP AND 5K ON AN EXTERNAL DRIVE FOR STORAGE. 13 GIG THAT IS AVAILABLE IS DECENT FOR ME )
      
      I THINK IN INDIA WE ARE GETTING CHARGER AND HEADPHONES I HOPE SO
      
      
      WHAT I DIDN'T GET
      
      1. NFC(NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION) ONLY YESTERDAY I CAME TO KNOW WHAT NFC MEANS AND BELIEVE ME YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE IT EVEN IF YOU GET IT SO DONT WASTE UR HARD EARNED MONEY UNLESS UR DAD IS HAVING AN AUDI OR A MERCEDES.
      
      2.EXPANDABLE MEMORY (BOY THAT REALLY FEELS BUT GRRR WHY DIDNT THEY JUST ADD AN EXPANDABLE SLOT -_-
      
      3.A 5.5 INCH SCREEN WELL, I AM BUYING A PHONE NOT A TAB
      
      REST EVERYTHING IS THERE AS FAR AS MY REQUIREMENTS ARE CONCERNED
      
      AS A WHOLE I FOUND WHAT I WAS SEARCHING FOR 2 MONTHS AND AT A PRICE LESS THAN WHAT MY BUDGET, ACTUALLY I WAS LOOKING FOR A PHONE IN THE RANGE 15-16K AND I GOT THIS ONE IN 14K SO HIGH CHEER AND RS1000 FOR BEER.... :)
      
      ALTHOUGH I HAVE TRIED TO BE HONEST IN THIS REVIEW BUT ITS NOT JUSTIFIED TILL I USE IT...WAITING EAGERLY"
Moto G,1,"WITH REFERENCE TO ABOVE SUBJECT I WOULD LIKE TO INFORM THAT I HAVE ORDERED 'MOTOROLA MOTO-G 16GB' THROUGH FLIPKART ON 18TH FEB 2014. MY ORDER NUMBER IS OD40218000103. MY MOBILE NUMBER IS 9723617252. THIS IS MY FIRST EVER TRANSACTION WITH FLIPKART.COM.
      
      
      AFTER A WEEK TIME FROM MY ORDER DATE MY ORDER STATUS IS THE SAME WHICH I FOUND ON VERY FIRST DAY. THEY HAVE APPROVED MY ORDER BUT NOT PROCESSED THE SAME EVEN AFTER A WHOLE WEEK TIME.
      
      
      BUT HERE IS MORE SHOCKING THING. I ORDERED SAME PIECE OF ITEM FOR ONE OF MY FRIEND ON 21ST FEB 2014 AFTER 3 DAYS I BOOKED MY ITEM. HE IS LIVING IN SAME CITY AND HIS ORDER NUMBER IS OD40221037583. SURPRISINGLY HE RECEIVED HIS MOBILE ON 24TH FEB 2014, JUST IN 3DAYS. I WAS SO SURPRISED AND SHOCKED THAT HOW COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT I AM NOT GETTING MATERIAL EVEN AFTER A WEEK AND SAME MATERIAL OTHER PERSON IS GETTING JUST IN 3 DAYS.
      
      
      I QUESTIONED HOW COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT ""YOU DO NOT HAVE MATERIAL IN STOCK FOR OLDER ORDER AND YOU ARE DELIVERING THE MATERIAL TO NEW ORDER""."
Moto G,1,"WORST SERVICE.. I HAD PLACED THE ORDER ON FEB 17 TILL NOW I DIDNT RECEIVE IT BUT OTHER PEOPLE WHO PLACED THE ORDER ON FEB 18 BUT THEY HAVE RECEIVED IT.

I WOULD SAY THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS JUST AWESOME (IN THIS PRICE RANGE )."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"BOUGHT IT OUTSIDE FOR 9700 WITH SCREEN GUARD. IT IS JUST AWESOME FOR THIS PRICE RANGE. THE TOUCH, THE ANIMATION, THE FEEL OF THE PHONE IS JUST SO RICH I BET U. U WONT FIND AN ALTERNATE AT THIS PRICE POINT!!!!
      
      APPS AND GAME ARE DECENT ENOUGH. BUT DEFINITELY RICHER FEEL THAN ANDROID.
      
      
      BATTERY IS LITTLE BAD BUT I RECOMMEND YOU TO TRY THIS!!!"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR RS.9630 WITH 8GB MEMORY CARD FREEBIE. INITIALLY I RECEIVED DEFECTIVE PHONE WITH CAMERA BUTTON NOT WORKING. THANKS TO FLIPKART, GOT THE REPLACEMENT JUST 2 DAYS AFTER REPLACEMENT REQUEST.
      
      COMING TO THE PHONE...EVERYTHING EXCELLENT.COMPARE TO ANY BRANDED PHONE UNDER 10K, YOU WONT GET THESE MUCH FEATURES.

      DON'T LOOK FOR THE PRICE FALL....ITS MORE THAN WORTH 10K..IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUY THIS PHONE, THEN LOOK FOR REPLACEMENT POLICY, AS YOU MAY GET A DEFECTIVE ONE."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS PHONE.. IT IS  A GREAT CHOICE IN THIS PRICE RANGE WITH FANTASTIC FEATURES AND WIDE APPLICATION RANGE.. ALL TOP APPS ARE AVAILABLE IN WINDOWS STORE AND ITS PERFORMANCE IS MARVELOUS.. GOT THIS PHONE ON 2ND DAY AFTER ORDERING.. THANKS TO FLIPKART..
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"FIRST OF ALL HATS OFF TO FLIPKART DELIVERY.. GOT THIS PHONE ON NEXT DAY OF ORDER PLACEMENT PLUSE SAVED LIKE RS. 600 WITH DISCOUNT..
      
      
      NOW AS FOR THE PHONE BEST PHONE NO DOUBT ABT IT... BELLOW 10K WITH WINDOWS 8 U CAN NOT EXPECT MORE .. PHONE WORKS GOOD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL.. AS FOR APPS YEAH THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY APPS AVAILABLE ON WINDOWS STORE BUT AGAIN WITH ANDROID MARKET WE DONT USE MORE SPECIFICALLY DONT NEED THAT MANY APPLICATIONS.. IF YOU WANNA PLAY ANGRY BIRDS AND TEMPLE RUN AND THOSE APPS DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE..  ALL THE USEFUL APPS ARE AVAILABLE FOR FREE SO NO WORRY THERE..
      
      
      NOT THIS BUT WHOLE LUMIA SERIES IS MORE FOR PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE.. YOU GET MS WARD, EXCEL THE WHOLE PACKAGE, SO THIS IS THE BEST DEAL U GET FOR 10K...
      
      
      AND ONE MORE THING NOKIA CITY LENS IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR LUMIA 520.."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"FIRST OF ALL I WAS ALSO ONE OF THE ANDROID LOVERS AND AFTER USING WINDOWS PHONE OF HTC ONCE I WASN'T INTERESTED IN WINDOWS PHONES ANYMORE, BUT THIS PHONE WITH ITS SLEEK DESIGN AND SEXY LOOKS FORCED ME TO BUY &AMP; TRY ONCE AGAIN. FRANKLY SPEAKING NOW IT IS THE TIME TO MOVE AHEAD FROM ANDROID. WITH ITS LOW PRICE I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY OTHER PHONE AVAILABLE WITH SUCH LOOKS AND AWESOME QUALITIES. LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST AS ALWAYS FLIPCART DELIVERED IT WITHIN 48 HOURS AT THE DOOR STEP BEFORE THE EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE !! SO ALL OF U IF U ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WINDOWS PHONES, GIVE IT A TRY IT WILL CHANGE UR PERCEPTION &AMP; MINDSET FOR EVER !!"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK FLIPKART FOR THEIR EXPRESS DELIVERY. I ORDERED AT 3.00 PM ON DAY 1. I REQUESTED THEM TO DELIVER QUICKLY TO GIVE AS A GIFT TO MY DAD. THEY DELIVERED NEXT DAY 4 PM.
      
      I AM NOT GONNA GIVE LENGTHY REVIEWS AS MANY HAVE ALREADY GIVEN. I'M GONNA LIST MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE. NOT GONNA COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MISSING FEATURES.
      
      CONS:
      
      HAD SOME ISSUES WITH CAMERA BUTTON INTIALLY AND LATER DISCOVERED IT IS A UNIVERSAL PROBLEM. BUT IT GOT RESOLVED WHEN I PLACED THE BACKCOVER AT SOME POSITION. LUCKY !!
      
      THEN HAD PROBLEMS WITH GMAIL -YET TO FIND SOME SOLUTION.
      
      IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE ALL THE OPEN APPLICATIONS BUT COULDN'T CLOSE THEM THERE.
      
      BATTERY IS OK. ALSO I COULD NOT FIND A HOLOGRAM IN THE BATTERY FOR ITS ORIGINALITY, WHERE I HAVE IT IN MY 5800 XPRESSMUSIC PHONE.
      
      VERY BASIC EAR PHONE. NOT A COMFORTABLE FIT FOR EARS.
      
      GETS SMUDGY AFTER SOMETIME OF USE. MAYBE GOOD SCREENGUARD WOULD SOLVE IT.
      
      I VE THE FEELING OF SLIPPING IT FROM MY HAND. GOOD CASE WOULD SOLVE IT.
      
      
      EXCEPT THE ABOVE, I FIND THIS PHONE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. EVERY OTHER FEATURE COMES UNDER PROS.
      
      SPECIAL MENTIONS,
      
      INTERNET EXPLORER IS ENOUGH TO OPEN VARIOUS CONTENT TYPES WITHOUT LAG AND ITS QUICK AND SHARP IN DISPLAYING CONTENTS
      
      CLARITY IS TOO GOOD
      
      TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS SUPER DOOPER
      
      CAMERA IS NOT AT ALL BAD. TRUST ME. I TOOK PICTURES IN LOW LIGHT, WHICH IS GOOD. IN DAY LIGHT, IT IS TOO GOOD.

Nokia Lumia 520,5,"FIRSTLY BE AWARE OF FAKE REVIEWS.
      
      
      THE REVIEW OF PHONEXPERT REALLY MADE ME LAUGH..HIS NARRATION IS COMPLETELY FAKE..HIS REVIEW ABT HERE DRIVE CLEARLY SHOWS IT......HE MISTOOK PS FOR A RESTAURANT..OMG !....CANT HE FIND A BOARD NAMING IT AS A PS..........
      
      
      STOP WRITING FALSE REVIEWS &AMP; MISGUIDING PEOPLE..
      
      
      YES THE OS WP8 IS A BIT IMMATURE, MIND IT EVEN NL620,720,820,920,925,928,1020,HTC 8S,8X USES THE SAME OS..MICROSOFT WILL DEFINITELY UPDATE THIS OS &AMP; THEY ARE UNDERAWAY IN COLLECTING THE CHANGES REQD. WHICH WILL BE ROLLED OUT SOON....IT WOULD BE GOOD &AMP; CLEAR IF MS HAD ROLLED FEW UPDATES IN SHORT INTERVALS RATHER THAN RELEASING A SINGLE LARGE COMPLETE UPDATE.......
      
      
      THIS ONE BELOW @10K IS VFM..
      
      
      IN ANDROID THE SOFTWARE &AMP; HARDWARE DEVELOPERS JOINED HANDS &AMP; EVERY FLAGSHIP AFTER AN YEAR STARTS LAGGING,,THIS IS BCS SOFTWARE TECH DEVELOP QUALITY APPS WHICH ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ADVANCED HARDWARE &AMP; IF U TRY TO RUN IT WITH OLD PROCESSOR, IT STARTS LAGGING N U'LL FEEL LAGGY &AMP; WILL MOVE TO NEW SMARTPHONE...THIS HAD BECAME A BUSINESS,,..OBSERVE IT PRACTICALLY ANY DROID MOBILE WORKS FINE FOR FIRST 5-6MONTHS...AFTER THAT ? IT SLEEPS WELL...BUT IN WP,THEY DIDNT HAD TO COMPETE MUCH IN THEMSELVES &AMP; IMP IS OS IS LIGHT NEXT TO IOS &AMP; BB OS BUT DROID IS HEAVY WHEN COMPARED WITH...DONT BELIEVE IN MY WORDS ? THEN THINK WHY  IPHONE5 TILL USING A DUALCORE PROCESSOR ?..WHY ANDROID IS RUNNING ON OCTA-CORES &AMP; QUADCORES N STILL LAGGING OCCASIONALLY ....."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"FLIPKART HAD A GREAT DEAL GOING FOR THIS PHONE, SO I PICKED IT UP THINKING I'D JUST GIFT IT TO SOME ONE. HOWEVER, ONCE THE PHONE ARRIVED I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH IT THAT I KEPT IT FOR MYSELF.
      
      
      BUILD QUALITY -NOKIA HAS HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK WITH THE BUILD QUALITY. IT FEELS LIKE A PHONE TWICE IT'S PRICE POINT.
      
      
      SCREEN - BRILLIANT BUT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO USE IN SUNNY CONDITIONS
      
      
      BATTERY - WAS WORRIED ABOUT BATTERY LIFE BUT IT'S ALL GOOD AND CHARGES FAST.
      
      
      OS - BRILLIANTLY RESPONSIVE BUT A SPARSE APPSTORE
      
      
      MUSIC - DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE AN EQUALIZER."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"FOLKS, THIS IS THE ONE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. ONE OF THE BEST BUDGET PHONES UNDER 10K. YOU ACTUALLY GET A FEEL OF USING A LUMIA 620/720 AS FAR AS THE PROCESSOR AND RAM IS CONCERNED. YOU DON'T GET A FRONT CAMERA FOR VIDEO CONFERENCING BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BUDGET PHONE THEN THIS ONE IS JUST FOR YOU. STOP BUYING ANDROID PHONES WITH POOR INTERFACE AND BATTERY BACKUP. TO BE VERY TRUE YOU WON'T GET A GOOD FEELING IF YOU BUY AN ANDROID PHONE FOR &LT; 20K. AS FAR AS LUMIA IS CONCERNED, WINDOWS MIGHT BE LAGGING BEHIND ANDROID IN TERMS OF APPLICATIONS, BUT DISPLAY, SPEED AND SEAMLESS INTEGRATION FROM SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES IS FAR BETTER THAN THE ANDROID PHONES. 5 STAR FOR THIS ONE. :)"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"GOOD PHONE SOO FAR, CHEAP AND GRAPHICS QUALITY LIKE 20K PHONE, I WAS WAITING FOR THIS PHONE TO LAUNCH, THE WINDOWS MARKETPLACE IS IMPROVING, EVEN THOUGH IT LAGS WELL BEHIND ITS RIVALS IN TERMS OF SHEER NUMBERS. STILL, YOU'LL FIND MANY FAVOURITES THERE INCLUDING SPOTIFY, NETFLIX AND SKYPE."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"GOT IT FOR MY COLLEGE GOING BROTHER WHO WAS LOOKING FOR A WINDOWS PHONE. COLLECTIVE REVIEW AS FOLLOWING:
      
      - BASIC FUNCTIONALITY IS TOP NOTCH. MOST OF THE DAILY USAGE APPS ARE ON WINDOWS MARKET.
      
      - THE MUSIC OUTPUT IS DECENT. HAVE TRIED WITH SENNHEISER EARPHONES / HEADPHONES.
      
      - RAM IS A LITTLE LOW, SO DON'T EXPECT HEAVY GAMES TO RUN ON IT.
      
      - CAMERA IS DECENT. NOT DUE TO MISSING FLASH, BUT THE SENSOR SEEMS TO BE A BIT MEDIOCRE.
      
      
      IN ONE LINE: GOOD PHONE IN THE PRICE RANGE, ESPECIALLY FOR WINDOWS LOVERS.
      
      
      IF YOUR PRICE RANGE IS ~10K, I WOULD ADVICE INSTEAD OF GOING FOR AN ANDROID PHONE, GO WITH THIS FOR A SNAPPY EXPERIENCE."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"GUYZ!! NEED A 'YES' OR  'NO'
      
      I DNT PLAY GAMES (I HAVE A LAPPY FULL OF THOSE MISSION AND FPS GAMES) AND STORE USELESS APPS ON MOBILE,  JUST USE SOME SLELECTIVE APPS LIKE WATSAPP, SHAZAM, AN IMAGE EDITOR ETC.
      
      SO I JUST WNNA KNW THAT IS THIS PHONE WORK PROPRLY WITH MY REQUIREMNTS?? OR IT WILL BE A DISASTER??"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"HA HA HA,,HEY YOU PSYCHO GOOD JOKE. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU OWN A SCAM-SUNG BAN-DROID AND NOW COME TO KNOW HOW GREAT WINDOWS PHONE IS. SO YOU ARE FEELING JEALOUS.
      
      
      ANYWAY IT WAS A GOOD JOKE. I WON'T EXPLAIN AGAIN BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO LOVE WINDOWS PHONE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT IS IT &AMP; HOW IT WORKS. STOP CAMPAIGNING FOR BAN-DROIDS ON WINDOWS THREAD BECAUSE EVEN IF BAN-DROID PROFITS, THEY WILL NOT PAY YOU A SINGLE PENNY LOLZ."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,HAT'S OFF TO NOKIA AND MICROSOFT FOR CREATING SUCH A WONDERFUL PHONE. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE FOR EVERYBODY. REALLY WONDERFUL PHONE. WORKS WITHOUT ANY HANG OR FREEZE. ANDROID PHONES IN THIS RANG ARE SUBJECT SOME SLOWNESS AFTER USING FOR A WHILE. BUT THIS WINDOWS PHONE IS ABSOLUTELY WORKS FINE EVEN AFTER PROLONGED DAYS OF USE.
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR PAST 1 WEEK NOW AND IT IS ONE HELL OF A PRODUCT. KUDOS TO NOKIA FOR MAKING LUMIA SO USER FRIENDLY.
      
      PROS - INTEGRATION WITH FB AND OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES, SPEED , LOOK AND FEEL, AWESOME XBOX GAMES , CAMERA (IT CLICKS BETTER PICS THAN MY  A 8 MP CAMERAPHONE)
      
      CONS - NO FILE MANAGER , NO EQUALIZER FOR MUSIC"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"HELLO FRIENDS,
      
      
      THE NOKIA LUMIA 520 IS A VERY VERY AWESOME PHONE. I GOT THIS PHONE IN FLIPCART AT RS.8454/- . THE WINDOWS OS WAS EXCELLENT. TOUCH IS VERY NICE AND THE WINDOWS APPS WAS AWESOME. VERY NICE USER INTERFACE. LIKE THIS PHONE VERY MUCH. I THINK NO ONE CAN BEAT NOKIA :)"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"HEY BUDDY, I DON'T KNOW HOW HOT YOUR CELL GET AFTER USE. BUT EVERY SMARTPHONE GETS HOTTER WITH LOTS OF USE SPECIALLY WEB BROWSING. THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU BROWSE, YOUR PHONE'S RAM AND PROCESSOR ARE CONSTANTLY IN USE AND ALSO IT DRAWS A LOT OF POWER FROM YOUR BATTERY. AND ABOVE ALL YOUR PHONE IS CONSTANTLY CATCHING THE INTERNET FREQUENCIES.
      
      
      IT'S NORMAL IF YOUR PHONE GETS HOTTER WHEN ON HEAVY USE (WEB BROWSING). I HAVE REFERRED WEB BROWSING AS HEAVY BECAUSE WHEN WE BROWSE, ALMOST ALL OF THE PHONES' RESOURCES ARE CONSTANTLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY WORKING.
      
      
      ACTUALLY OUR PHONE DOESN'T GET SO MUCH HOTTER AS WE THINK. ONE THING YOU CAN DO WHEN YOUR PHONE GETS HOT NEXT TIME IS: MAKE THE HOTTER PART OF YOUR PHONE TOUCH YOUR FACE, THEN YOU WILL REALLY KNOW HOW HOT IT IS. ACTUALLY OUR FACE CAN RECOGNIZE THE ACTUAL TEMPERATURE WHILE OUR HANDS CAN'T (SCIENTIFIC).
      
      
      MY EARLIER GALAXY S DUOS USE TO GET HOTTER WITH MORE USE. I SOLD IT AFTER USING FOR 1 YEAR. I AM NOW USING 520. HOWEVER I DON'T FEEL SO MUCH HEAT AS COMPARED TO MY EARLIER PHONE. HOPE IT HELPED YOU."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"HI ALL,
      
      I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER MY NOKIA LUMIA 520 PURCHASE 3 MONTHS AGO. I HAD BEEN AN ANDROID-MANIAC. I NEVER WANTED TO TRY ANYTHING OTHER THAN ANDROID . BUT I DON'T KNOW  WHY IT CAME TO MY MIND BUYING A WINDOWS MOBILE. I WAS AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF NOKIA. SO I PREFERRED A NOKIA WINDOWS MOBILE. SINCE IT WAS MY FIRST WINDOWS MOBILE, I DIDN'T WANNA GET DISAPPOINTED(I WAS WRONG) BY SPENDING TOO MUCH. SO I WENT FOR NOKIA LUMIA 520 AS IT WAS AFFORDABLE. ONCE I GOT MY HANDS ON  THE NEW LUMIA PHONE, I REGRETTED MY CONDESCENDING VIEW ABOUT WINDOWS MOBILES. THERE HAS BEEN NEVER A DAY PASSED WITHOUT ME APOLOGISING MY LUMIA MOBILE FOR NOT BUYING IT BEFORE AND BEING ANDROID-OBSESSED. NOW I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN TRYIHG OUT LUMIA 920. THANKS TO FLIPKART'S LIGHTNING DELIVERY. I ORDERED ON FRIDAY(10 PM). I GOT THE DELIVERY ON SUNDAY(3 PM).I RECKON EVERYONE,WHO IS OBSESSED WITH ANDROID, SHOULD GIVE LUMIA A TRY THAT YOU WONT REGRET.
      
      
      PROS
      
      - WINDOWS 8'S TILED INTERFACE IS ALLURING
      
      - THERE ARE SO MANY FEATURES TO EXPLORE
      
      
      CONS
      
      - NOT EXTENSIVE FREE APPLICATIONS AS ANDROID"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"HI, I ORDERED THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART (ITS MY FIRST ELECTRONIC ONLINE PURCHASE) , PHONE WAS DELIVERED IN GREAT CONDITION . THANKS FLIPKART KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK .
      
      NOW , COMING BACK TO THE POINT ,I'VE USED CANVAS 2 , SONY XPERIA SOLA &AMP; P , &AMP; IPAD MINI . BUT AFTER USING THIS WINDOWS OS WHICH PROVIDES EVERY FUNCTIONALITY WHAT OTHER OS HAV TO OFFER THIS IS WHAT WE CALLED AS FLUID IT REALLY FLOWS. IPAD MINI CAN COMPETE WITH IT BUT IT LOSES IN NOT HAVING LIVE TILES , WHAT I CALLED ONE SCREEN INFO (U CAN KEEP ALL UR APPS ON 1 SINGLE SCREEN ), SHAPE &AMP; BUILD QUALITY ,IT REALLY FEELS BULLET PROOF(SAME WITH 720, 820,920) OFFLINE NAVIG., &AMP; MANY MORE ..... FEATURES .
      
      MY PHONE'S KEYBOARD RESPONDS EVEN IF I JUST HOVER MY FINGER OVER THAT PARTICULAR ALPHABET OR APP . IT REALLY FEELS HI-TECH .
      
      THE APPS ARE TESTED BY MICROSOFT AND THEN THEY ARE UPLOADED ON WIN. STORE SO NO TROUBLE IN INSTALLING THEM .
      
      IT GIVES GREAT SPEED IN 2G TOO. VOICE ASSISTED HERE DRIVE  IS BONUS , GOOD FOR BIKERS . I M ONE HAVNG R15.
      
      JUST GO FOR IT EVEN IF U ARE UPGRADING FROM SAMSUNG STAR OR OTHERS ."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I AM IN LOVE WITH PHONE !! GOT IT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND ON HER BIRTHDAY :)N SHE LOVES IT..
      
      
      THIS PHONE HAS SO MUCH TO OFFER :)
      
      - WINDOWS 8 RUNNING ON AT MINIMUM COST.
      
      - GAMES ARE RUNNING REALLY GOOD ON 512 MB RAM.
      
      - FOR MUSIC LOVER , IT HAS EVERYTHING AVAILABLE ON NOKIA STORE :) JUST DOWNLOAD YOUR FAVORITE SONG FOR FREE.
      
      - 'HERE MAPS' ARE STILL IN MATURING STATE,BUT YES OFFLINE MAP FEATURE WILL SURELY ABLE TO HELP YOU WHEN NO SIGNAL IS THERE ;-)
      
      - SLEEK AND DESIGN WILL GIVE YOU FEEL OF HAVING A COOL SMART PHONE.
      
      
      NO FRONT CAMERA LET PEOPLE THINK FEW TIMES THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE VIDEO CALLS,BUT JUST TO CLEAR AIR ,YOU CAN MAKE VIDEO CALLS USING BACK CAMERA.(USING MIRROR IS ANOTHER TRICK)
      
      
      CAMERA FEATURE OF CAPTURING IMAGES UNDER DARK OR LOW LIGHT REALLY AMAZED ME :)
      
      (NO FLASH OFCOURSE )
      
      
      IF YOU ARE LOOKING SOMETHING OTHER THAN CROWD OF ANDROID AT LOW RANGE,GO FOR IT I WILL SAY !!"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I BELIEVED THAT TOUCH WAS ALWAYS GOOD FOR ANDROID...
      
      BUT SOME HOW DUE TO THE COMMON INTERFACE WHICH EVERY BRAND OF TOUCH PHONES WERE SPORTING I DIDNT OPT FOR ANDROID AND INSTEAD WENT FOR WINDOWS...
      
      
      WINDOWS 8 EXPERIENCE IS TRUELY IMMERSIVE, SPONTANEOUS AND SUPER FLUIDIC...YOU CAN FEEL THE GO IN THE SYSTEM...I TRUELY CONGRATULATE NOKIA AND MICROSOFT FOR BRINGING THIS BRILLIANT PHONE TO OUR LIVES...KUDOS TO ALL...
      
      
      THANKS FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING THE PHONE BEFORE TIME...(6 DAYS BEFORE SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATE)"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AS ANDROID IS TOO COMMON THESE DAYS. ABOVE ALL WINDOWS IS MUCH MORE EASIER TO USE THAN ANDROID, FAST BROWSING, USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE (HAS ALWAYS BEEN NOKIA'S BENCHMARK.) IN THIS BUDGET LUMIA 520 IS WORTH BUYING. ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES GAMES CRASH WHILE PLAYING(ONCE IN A HUNDRED.)
      
      CAMERA DOESN'T GIVE QUALITY PICTURES IN DULL LIGHT AND UPON ZOOMING IN.
      
      
      ITS WORTH BUYING. GO AHEAD."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I GOT PRODUCT FOR THE LOWEST PRICE FROM FLIPKART .. 8450/-  .. AWESOME NA ?
      
      MANY PEOPLE REVIEWED THE PRODUCT IN DETAILS .. SO I DON'T WONNA  DO THE SAME ..
      
      IF YOU WANT A PHONE WITH THE FACILITIES YOU COMMONLY USE .. THIS IS THE BEST PHONE ...
      
      
      THIS PHONE DOESN'T HAVE NFC - RARELY USED FEATURE .. YET TO BE POPULAR , REMEMBER NFC IS USEFUL ONLY IF OTHERS ALSO HAVE THE NFC ENABLED PHONE.
      
      
      NO FRONT CAM - HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE USING VIDEO CALLING FACILITY ..
      
      
      LESS APPS - YOU KNOW , HOW MANY PROFESSIONALS ARE WORKING IN MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGIES ESPECIALLY   .NET .. FOR SURE APPS WILL COME SOONER .. MICROSOFT IS A MARKET CHANGER .. THEY KNOW HOW TO GET IN TO THE MARKET .
      
      
      NO FLASH - ITS A DRAWBACK .. BUT THINK , YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR IT ... YOU ARE PAYING ONLY 9.5 K IN THE WORST CASE.
      
      
      I PERSONALLY WON'T RECOMMEND SPENDING ABOVE 10K FOR A MOBILE PHONE , IT IS JUST A PHONE CAN BE USED MAX FOR 3 YEARS ..
      
      
      THIS IS THE BEST PHONE YOU CAN GRAB AND HAVE FUN .. SURELY YOU WORTH IT ..
      
      
      CONS APART FROM COMMON REVIEWS
      
      
      -PHONE GETS HEATED SOONER (ON HEAVY PROCESSING .. IN COMMON IN ALL THE SMART PHONES :P).
      
      
      -SOME TIMES WINDOWS PHONE 8  LL NOT RESPOND TO CERTAIN THINGS , YOU NEED TO RESTART THE PHONE.(EG : THERE IS A OPTION TO INSTALL THE APPS FROM SD CARD , BUT SD CARD OPTION WONT BE VISIBLE IN STORE, NEED TO RESTART THE PHONE) FEW MORE ISSUES LIKE THAT RESOLVED BY RESTARTING.
      
      
      SOME APPS WILL NOT BE SHOWN IN INSTALL FROM SD CARD OPTION , SOUNDS FUNNY .. STILL I COULDN'T RESOLVE IT."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I GUESS THERE IS NO OTHER PHONE ON THIS EARTH WHICH PROVIDES SUCH A NICE UI, MAKE &AMP; DESIGN AT THIS PRICE CATEGORY.
      
      
      I AM NOT A GAMER AND NOT A HOPELESS APP HUNGRY. SO MY LUMIA 520 PROVIDES ME WITH ALL I NEED. INDEED I WOULD SAY I GOT MORE THEN WHAT I NEED. OFFICE SUITE IS EXTRAORDINARY. I NEVER THOUGHT, EDITING AN EXCEL FILE WOULD BE SO MUCH EASY ON A MOBILE FILE. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T DO ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN DO ON A DESKTOP, STILL YOU CAN DO ALL THE BASIC OFFICE FILE EDITING WHEN YOU ARE MOOVING OR YOU ARE NOT IN OFFICE.
      
      
      EMAIL SETUP IS GREAT. I SET UP 2 ACCOUNTS AND I GET EMAILS SIMULTANEOUSLY ON BOTH THE ACCOUNTS. ALSO IT'S VERY EASY TO SAVE THE ATTACHMENT FILES TO SKYDRIVE OR ATTACH A FILE FROM SKYDRIVE OR INTERNAL MEMORY DIRECTLY WITH SO EASE. THIS PHONE COMPLETES ME IN ALL THE WAY. JUST A GREAT PHONE. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO PEOPLE WHO USE PHONE FOR WORK PURPOSE AND NOT FOR GAMING."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I HAD PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT WHEN IT WAS NEWLY LAUNCHED... I MUST SAY THAT I WAS DELIGHTED BY USING THIS PHONE OF NOKIA.. IT IS PERFECT TO SAY THAT ""NOKIA KA BHAROSA""  I'LL SUGGEST TO EVERYONE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A BUDGET PHONE WITH ALL FEATURES, THEY CAN GO AHEAD WITH THIS, BUT ONLY ONE DRAWBACK VIZ., NO FM.. BUT STILL 3 CHEERS FOR NOKIA LUMIA 520."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AROUND FOR A PHONE WHICH SUITS MY OFFICE REQUIREMENTS, AND HERE IT IS. THE LUMIA 520. SUPER SENSITIVE TOUCH, VERY EASY TO HANDLE AND A DECENT CAMERA. BTW THANKS TO FLIPKART.. I GOT THIS MOBILE FOR 8,644 WAY CHEAPER THAN ANY OTHER SELLERS. A MUST HAVE PHONE FOR ALL.
      
      
      NOKIA-LUMIA 520 THE BEST AFFORDABLE WINDOWS PHONE AVAILABLE IN MARKET, BETTER THAN CHEAP PLASTIC LOOKING SAMSUNG ANDROID PHONES"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE RECENTLY. THE HARDWARE CONFIGURATION IS SUPERB. IT HELPS YOU TO RUN ALL MAJOR APPLICATIONS AND GAMES. UNLIKE THE LOW END ANDROID PHONES, IT IS REALLY FAST. THE TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS VERY SMOOTH. THE BUILD QUALITY IS BETTER THAN SAMSUNG. I WOULD SUGGEST IF YOUR BUDGET IS WITHIN 10K GO FOR THIS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,I HAVE ORDERED LUMIA 520 ON FLIPKART TODAY ONLY AND AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. I HAVE RECEIVED POSITIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT IT FROM MY FRIENDS AND OTHER FELLAS AND  AM CONVINCED  ABOUT ITS PERFORMANCE. ITS WORTH THE WAIT ;)
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I HAVE PURCHASED LUMIA 520 FROM LOCAL SHOP......VERY SIMPLE AND FANTASTIC MOBILE BY NOKIA...VERY GOOD LOOKS,NEVER HANGS,VERY GOOD CAMERA .......COLORS OF MOBILES ARE ALSO VERY BEST .......SOUND QUALITY BEST
      
      
      9.5/10
      
      
      THANKS"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I JUST GOT THIS PHONE FEW DAYS BACK . I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING POINTS :
      
      PRO:
      
      1. GOOD DISPLAY
      
      2. POWERFUL PROCESSING ( TEMPLE RUN GAME RUNS WITH NO LAG, EVEN IF U KEEP LISTENING TO SONGS AT THE BACKGROUND ! )
      
      3.THE BEST VIDEO RECORDING ... STUNNINGLY CLEAR
      
      4. COST FACTOR

      1. PHOTOS ARE SOMETIMES BLUR
      
      2. FINGER PRINTS ON THE SCREEN ... LOOKS CLUMSY
      
      3. CAMERA BUTTON IN SOME HANDSETS ARE NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY"

      1ST WATSAPP IS WORKING FINE BUT SOME TIMES IT DOES NOT UPDATE SO U HAS TO OPEN THE APP TO C IF ANY NEW MSGES HAVE COME, HAPPENS ONLY ON DATA CONNECTION NOT ON WIFI.
      
      2ND CAN'T SHARE VIDEOS ON WATSAPP THOUGH RUMOURS OF AN UPDATE FOR 8.1 LL FIX ARE HIGH
      
      3RD SHAZAM MANY MORE SIMILAR APPS ARE THERE IN THE STORE.
      
      4TH PHOTOFUNIA, LOMOGRAM, NOKIA'S CREATIVE STUDIO, SHOFIA LENSES A LOT MORE QUALITY APPS IN THE STORE LL TAKE CARE OF THE FOTO EDITING.
      
      WINDOWS 8 IS NOT ON THE LEVEL OF ANDROID AND IOS BECUZ ITS A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH WHICH FOCUS ON MAKING DAY TO DAY WORK EASY. IT HAS ITS SET OF SHORTCOMINGS BUT THE POSITIVES EASILY OUT WEIGH IT.
      
      BUY IT USE IT AND U LL REALIZE HOW EASY THE OS WORKS FOR DAY TO DAY STUFF. MY SIS USING XPERIA P WAS GENUINELY IMPRESSED WITH THE EASY N SMOOTH WORKING WP8."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"I USED BLACKBERRY DEVICES FOR OVER 5 YEARS, ANDROID ONE FOR OVER A YEAR AND WINDOWS 8 OVER A MONTH. I LIKE NOKIA LUMIA THE BEST, THEN BLACKBERRY (FOR RIGIDITY, GREAT BATTERY LIFE AND SIMPLICITY) AND THEN COMES ANDROID. LUMIA WOULD NOT HANG UNLIKE ANDROID WHICH EVERY NOW AND THEN WOULD HANG DESPITE BEING A LATEST DEVICE WITH AMPLE OF RAM AND A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR. NOKIA HERE MAPS IS SUCH A BEAUTY AND WORKS WONDER IN PUNE CITY. THE 520 IS JUST OVER RS. 9000 NOW, MORE THAN WORTH THAT PRICE. I AM LOVING THE PHONE TOTALLY... THE ONLY THING THAT I AM ANNOYED OF IS THE BATTERY LIFE WITH 3G ON, ELSE IT ROCKS."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE THIS MORE IF I GET IT SAME PRICE ON WHICH I HAD BOUGHT IT WAS REALLY VERY GOOD PRICE HOPE FOR SAME PRICE SAME SOON SO PLEASE COME WITH LOWEST PRICE ALSO LOOKING FOR BEST RATES FOR OTHER ITEM WHICH I HAD PURCHASED IN MY ORDERS HISTORY

      I LIKE VERY MUCH FOLLOWING FEATURES ABOUT NOKIA LUMIA 520:
      
      1.	TOUCH SCREEN RESPONSE IS EXCELLENT ONE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS PRICE RANGE, NOKIA PROVIDE THIS EXCELLENT DEVICE.
      
      2.	WINDOW 8 OS IS VERY SIMPLE AND ALSO USER FRIENDLY. ITS LOOK AND FEEL AND ANIMATION MOTION IS FABULOUS.
      
      3.	I LIKE VERY MUCH NOKIA MUSIC STORE FROM WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD SONGS FREELY. BUT FIRST YOU HAVE TO ACTIVATE INTERNET SERVICE OF YOUR RESPECTED SERVICE PROVIDER.
      
      4.	CAMERA RESULT IS SUPERB. ONE DISADVANTAGE IS THAT THIS DEVICE HAS NOT FLASH LIGHT FEATURE.
      
      THERE ARE ALSO MANY MORE FEATURES OF THIS CELL THAT I LIKE VERY MUCH."

Nokia Lumia 520,5,"MY FIRST PHONE WAS NOKIA 1100. IT WAS AWESOME, I USED IT FOR 3.5 YEARS BUT IT'S STILL WITH ME, JUST IT'S BATTERY GOT DAMAGED. AFTER THAT PHONE I GOT MYSELF A SONY ERICSSON W810I. IT WAS ANOTHER AWESOME PHONE. BUT AFTER I GOT A JOB, I SWITCHED TO SAMSUNG SMARTPHONE GALAXY S DUOS. IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING PHONE FOR ME AS I NEVER USED A SMARTPHONE BEFORE. THE DISPLAY WAS BIG, I WAS ABLE TO EMAIL WITH EASE, BROWSE WEB PAGES COMFORTABLY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY SAMSUNG WAS STOLEN FROM MY OFFICE DRAWER ON THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY 13.
      
      
      SO I WAS LOOKING FOR A MID RANGE PHONE -BASICALLY A SMART PHONE AS I ALREADY GOT THE TASTE OF IT. THEN ONE OF MY FRIEND SUGGESTED ME LUMIA 820 BUT IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ME SO I OPTED FOR LUMIA 520 AND I FINALLY BOUGHT IT. AND OOPS I FALL IN LOVE WITH MY PHONE. THE MOST AMAZING AND AWESOME PHONE I HAVE EVER USED... MORE THEN AVERAGE BATTERY LIFE, EASY MAIL SET UP, NICE CAMERA EVEN IF WITHOUT FLASH, EXCEL, PDF, POWERPOINT, WORD WHAT ELSE YOU WANT FROM YOUR PHONE??? IN A WAY IF SOME ONE WOULDN'T HAVE STOLEN MY SAMSUNG, I WOULDN'T HAVE DISCOVERED THIS AWESOME PHONE

      ANDROID: 10/5
      
      WP: -5/5
      
      
      WP PHONES ARE THE MOST NOTORIOUS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. DON'T BUY IT OR YOU WILL REGRET ALL YOUR LIFE. HERE IS WHY.
      
      
      ON DAY 1 I SET MY PHONE ON CHARGING FOR 2 HRS. AFTER FULL CHARGE I OPENED EXPLORER 10 AND WAS GOING THROUGH CERTAIN WEBSITE. AFTER A FEW MINUTES, I GOT A NOTIFICATION SAYING ""LOW BATTERY"" I THOUGHT IT WAS A FAULTY NOTIFICATION AND CONTINUED BROWSING THEN GUESS WHAT??? THE PHONE GET TURNED OFF AUTOMATICALLY ALL OF A SUDDEN. AT LEAST MY ANDROID WOULD RUN FOR 1 MORE HOUR.
      
      
      ON DAY 2 I MADE THE FIRST CALL TO A FRIEND TO TELL HIM WHAT A GREAT PHONE I JUST BOUGHT. THEN GUESS WHAT??? I JUST HEARD THE WORD ""HELLO"" FROM MY FRIEND AND THEN IT GET DISCONNECTED. I WAS WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED THEN DISCOVERED THAT THE BATTERY SLIPPED OUT OF THE PHONE. AT LEAST MY ANDROID'S BATTERY WOULDN'T HAVE SLIPPED UNTIL ALL THE BATTERY IS CONSUMED I.E I COULD HAVE AT LEAST FINISHED TALKING WITH MY FRIEND.
      
      
      NEXT DAY I SAW A GATHERING IN MY LOCALITY. THEN I FOUND THAT THERE A HUGE SNAKE IN ONE'S CLOSET. I DIDN'T HAVE A SECOND TO WASTE, I JUST TOOK OUT MY WONDERFUL LUMIA AND TOOK FEW SNAP  OF THE SNAKE. IN THE EVENING I WAS RESTLESS TO SHOW THE PICTURE TO MY FRIENDS THEN SEND THE PICTURES TO THEIR MOBILE THROUGH BLUETOOTH. THEN GUESS WHAT??? THE SNAKE WAS NOT THERE ON ANY OF THE PICTURES. THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST 1 SNAKE PICTURE IF THE PICTURES WERE TAKEN FROM A ANDROID.
      
      
      AFTER THE ABOVE PATHETIC INCIDENCE I WAS STILL HAPPY COZ AT LEAST MY PHONE HAS HERE DRIVE WHICH IS NOT THERE ON ANY OTHER PHONE. ONE DAY ME &AMP; MY FRIENDS WAS ON A OUTING AND WAS FINDING A GOOD RESTAURANT AND I TOOK OUT MY DEVICE AND START FINDING THE CLOSEST GOOD RESTAURANT. I GOT ONE AND WE FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION. FINALLY REACHED THE DESTINATION. BUT AFTER ENTERING INTO THE BUILDING WE DISCOVERED IT WAS A POLICE STATION. IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING FOR ME. ALL MY FRIENDS LAUGHED AT ME. THANKS GOD THERE IS NO HERE DRIVE ON ANDROID.
      
      
      THEN 1 DAY I WAS SEARCHING THROUGH APP STORE AND I LIKED A FEW APP AND INSTALLED THEM ON MY PHONE. BUT WHEN I TRIED TO USE THEM I GOT NOTIFICATIONS LIKE ""THIS APP IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR PHONE, PLEASE TRY ANOTHER APP. AT LEAST IN CASE OF ANDROID, THE APP WOULDN'T GET INSTALLED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
      
      
      AND NOW THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENED: I RECHARGED MY NUMBER WITH RS 890 LAST SUNDAY AND AFTER THAT I HARDLY MADE 6 - 7 CALLS AVERAGING  3-4 MINUTES THEN YESTERDAY I DISCOVERED THAT I AM LEFT WITH ONLY RS 0.07.THIS WAS A NIGHTMARE FOR ME. I CALLED MY VODAFONE CUSTOMER CARE AND ASKED WHAT NONSENSE IS THIS. THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE NOT FOOLING ME BUT THEIR RECORD SAYS THAT MY NUMBER HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY SENDING MMS RANDOMLY TO ANY OTHER PERSON AND THIS WENT ON TILL MY BALANCE CAME DOWN TO 0.07. IF IT WERE ANDROID, IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN AT LEAST 2 MONTHS TO COMPLETE SENDING ALL THE MMS AND IN THE MEANTIME I COULD HAVE EASILY IDENTIFY WHAT IS HAPPENING AND TAKE PRECAUTIONS.
      
      
      NOW I WANT TO SAY ALL THE LUMIA BUYERS THAT DON'T GO FOR THIS PHONE OR IT WILL SUCK YOUR LIFE. YOU WILL NOT ONLY LOSE YOUR MONEY BUT IT'S QUITE EMBARRASSING TO OWN A LUMIA. GO FOR ANDROID. EVEN THE COSTLIEST ANDROID IS -2000% BETTER THEN LUMIA."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"NOTE: IT IS A DETAILED REVIEW FOR THOSE COMPLAINING ABOUT WP 8 AND SINGING THE SPY-DROIDS SONG. IT IS FROM MY PERSONAL AND EXPERIENCED VIEW ONLY.
      
      
      WARNING:
      
      PLEASE DON'T HIT YOUR HEAD ON WALL IF YOU ARE HOLDING ANDROID AND READING THIS REVIEW.
      
      
      # LOOK AND FEEL______________________________
      
      WELL, I WON'T SAY ANDROIDS HAVE GOT BAD GARDENS BUT THEY HAVE WEEDS IN IT. AFTER USING HUNDREDS OF COOL LOOKING THEMES, ALL I GOT IS SLOWER PROCESSING. I MEAN THE LOADING SCREENS BECAME SLOWER THAN EVER (I THINK THE LOADING SCREENS REQUIRE AN EXTRA LOADING MESSAGE). IT DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH WP 8. MICROSOFT BELIEVES IN THE POLICY OF ""CONTENT-OVER-CHROME"" THAT NOT ONLY UTILIZES THE GIVEN 1GHZ PROCESSOR BUT ALSO GIVES AN ULTRA MODERN LOOK WITH ITS LIVE METRO STYLE THEME THAT ARE RARELY FOUND IN HANDS AMIDST THE CROWD OF SPY-DROIDS HOLDERS, GIVING IT A UNIQUE LOOK. MOREOVER, NEW WP8 THEMES ARE COMING IN WP STORE THAT WON'T SLOW DOWN YOUR PHONE AND GIVE IT A LOOK OF YOUR CHOICE.
      
      
      # NOKIA CO-OPERATION______________________________
      
      WP 8 BECAME EVEN BIGGER WITH ITS CO-OPERATION WITH NOKIA. I MEAN FOR EVERYTHING YOU NEED, YOU HAVE DUAL OPTIONS. SAY MUSIC, YOU HAVE BOTH NOKIA XPRESS MUSIC AS WELL AS WINDOWS MUSIC. WHAT'S MORE? YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THOUSANDS OF SONGS FOR FREE. HOW? 1 SONG IN NOKIA STORE CONSUMES SOME 1MB WITHOUT LOSING QUALITY. SO, A DATA USAGE OF 1GB IS ENOUGH FOR MUSIC LOVERS. IT IS ABSENT IN ANDROIDS. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH SAMSUNG SOUNDS WITH ANDROIDS AS ITS PRIMARY OS THESE DAYS, IT CAN'T WITHSTAND NOKIA. EVER HEARD OF SAMSUNG MUSIC STORE?
      
      
      # APPS______________________________
      
      ITS ONE OF THE MOST SPREAD GREAT RUMOR ALL OVER THE INTERNET ""LUMIA 520'S WP STORE HAS LIMITED APPS AND IS FAR BEHIND ANDROID'S GOOGLE PLAY. GET AN ANDROID AND WAIT UNTILL WP HAS PLENTY OF APPS"". LET ME REMIND YOU OF THE TIME, WHEN ANDROID WAS RELEASED IN 2005 WITH GOOGLE'S COLLABORATION, HOW MANY APPS DID THEY CREATE IN ONE YEAR? FOR YOUR KNOWLEDGE, 34,000 APPS. SO STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT WP 8'S 1,65,000 APPS RELEASES IN JUST A YEAR. AND IF YOU'RE AMONG THOSE PUMPKINS WHO THINKS TO GET IT LATER, THERE ARE TWO WORDS FOR YOU, YOU'LL REPENT. THEY ARE WORKING ON IT AND NEW APPS ARE BEING ADDED DAILY.
      
      
      # OS______________________________
      
      WINDOWS PHONE 8 OS HAS BEEN THE BEST FOR ME SO FAR. BE IT PRIVACY, SECURITY OR UI. MICROSOFT IS STRICT ABOUT ITS POLICY, MORE THAN GOOGLE. HOW? BECAUSE WP'S APPS DON'T SPY YOU EVERYWHERE AND ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION LIKE THOSE SPY-DROIDS. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EDIT ITS SYSTEM FILES AND MAKE IT A WAREHOUSE AND LATER SELL IT FOR FEW CENTS LIKE ANDROIDS. BECAUSE MICROSOFT DOESN'T COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA FROM YOUR DEVICE AND SHOW YOU MORE RELEVANT ADS TO INCOME MORE VIA ADWORDS LIKE GOOGLE.
      
      TO ENHACE THE GLORY OF SPY-DROID, THEY HAVE MADE A SUCCESSFUL WAREHOUSE AND NAMED IT GOOGLE PLAY, A JUNK BOX WHERE AT LEAST 50% OF THE APPS HAVE MALWARES. WHY? BECAUSE GOOGLE PLAY CHECKS APPS FOR MALWARES - ACCORDING TO THEM, AFTER HOURS OR DAYS OF UPLOAD. AFTER THE DOWNLOAD BUTTON HAS GOT THOUSANDS OF HITS!. ON THE OTHER HAND, MICROSOFT MODERATORS SCAN APPS FOR MALWARES BEFORE THE UPLOAD. IF DETECTED, THEY BAN THE APP AND SEVERAL BANS CAN TERMINATE THE UPLOADER'S ACCOUNT. THAT'S HOW ITS NOT A WAREHOUSE YET. I'D RATHER GO FOR A JAVA BASED PHONE THAN AN ANDROID.
      
      IF YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE OS, FIRST FEEL FREE TO EXPLAIN ME WHY THE FIRST LINE OF ARTICLE GOES LIKE ""ANDROID IS A DIRTY OPERATING SYSTEM DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR TOUCHSCREEN MOBILE DEVICES SUCH AS SMARTPHONES AND TABLET COMPUTERS."" IF YOU SEARCH WIKIPEDIA FOR ""ANDROID"". OBVIOUSLY, THE ARTICLE IS WRITTEN AND UPDATED REGULARLY BY EXPERIENCED HOLDERS ONLY.
      
      
      NOW ITS UP TO YOU GUYS TO LEARN FROM OTHERS MISTAKE BY NOT TAKING AN ANDROID OR BETTER DO A MISTAKE YOURSELF AND TEACH YOURSELF A LESSON!"

Nokia Lumia 520,5,THE PHONE IS SUPERB. I HAVE SEEN MANY REVIEWS WHERE THEY SAY THE PHONE LACKS FRONT CAM &AMP; LED FLASH!!! GUYS LOOK AT THE PRICE &AMP; COMPLAIN.

Nokia Lumia 520,5,"THIS REVIEW IS REPLY TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT USED IT AND ARE JUST TROLLING AROUND.
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS BEST IN ITS PRICE RANGE AND CAN BEAT TOP LEVEL ANDROID PHONES IN TERM OF SMOOTHNESS IN ITS OPERATING. THERE IS NO HANG LIKE ANDROID AND YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT VIRUSES BECAUSE THIS OPERATING SYSTEM IS TOTALLY SECURE.I AM POINTING OUT FEW THINGS WHICH PEOPLE ARE JUST TROLLING ABOUT HERE EVEN WITHOUT USING THIS PHONE.
      
      
      1) TOUCH :- THIS PHONE HAS GOT BEST TOUCH SCREEN WHICH YOU CAN GET. IT IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE THAT'S WHY IT CAN WORK EVEN IF YOU HAVE GLOVES ON!!! NOW YOU CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE ARE LYING WHEN THEY SAY TOUCH IS NOT GOOD.
      
      
      2) NO FM :- PLEASE ! IF YOU WRITE A REVIEW DON'T MENTION THINGS WHICH ARE NOT SPECIFIED AS FEATURE IN PHONE ALREADY. EVERYONE KNOWS THIS PHONE DOESN'T HAVE FM, SO HOW DOES IT BECOME CON? OR A PROBLEM TO YOU LATER. DIDN'T YOU KNOW FROM BEFORE ???? BY THE WAY FM UPDATE IS COMING IN AUGUST UPDATE.ALSO WITH UNLIMITED NOKIA MUSIC SUBSCRIPTION I DON'T THINK ANYONE NEEDS FM. ESPECIALLY WHEN NOKIA MUSIC STORE SONGS ARE JUST 1MB IN SIZE AND HAVE SUPERB QUALITY!!!
      
      
      3) NO FLASH: - HOW IS THIS CON? ITS MENTIONED FROM BEFORE THIS PHONE DOESN'T HAVE FLASH ,SO WHY COMPLAIN ABOUT IT LATER.YOU WANT FLASH GO FOR LUMIA 620.
      
      
      4) APPS :- NOW THIS IS THE POINT ON WHICH ALMOST EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE COMMENTING EVEN WITHOUT HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE. WINDOWS PHONE 8 OS IS JUST FEW MONTHS OLD AND ALREADY IT HAS 160,000+ APPS . THIS NUMBER OF APPS CAME TO ANDROID AND IPHONE AFTER YEARS!!!!  ALL THE IMPORTANT APPS ARE AVAILABLE.AND THEY ARE NOT MALWARE INFESTED LIKE ANDROID ONES BECAUSE MICROSOFT CHECKS THEM ALL BEFORE ADDING TO STORE. BTW ITS FOOLISH TO GO ON APP NUMBER . WHO USES MORE THAN 100 APPS? SO WHY DO YOU NEED 7,00,000 APPS?  WHEN MOST OF THEM ARE EITHER MALWARE OR A PROJECT MADE BY COLLEGE STUDENT .
      
      
      5) OS: WINDOWS PHONE OS IS MUCH BETTER TO ANDROID. THIS SYSTEM IS SECURE SO YOU CAN TRUST IT FOR MOBILE BANKING AND OTHER PRIVATE STUFF. WHEREAS IN ANDROID ANYONE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR PRIVATE DATA.YOU CAN SEARCH ON NET AND EASILY FIND HOW ANDROID APPS ARE COMING WITH MALWARE WITH ACCESS YOUR PRIVATE DATA.AFTER ALL GOOGLE MAIN MOTIVE IN MAKING  ANDROID WAS TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO SHOW YOU BETTER ADS.THATS IT. DON'T GET FOOLED THAT ANDROID IS OPEN SOURCE SO ITS BETTER.GOOGLE AND ALL THOSE OTHER APPS ARE CONSTANTLY TRACKING YOU.
      
      
      6) BATTERY LIFE: BATTERY LIFE IS NOT AN ISSUE IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE A SMARTPHONE. PEOPLE HERE COMPLAIN ABOUT BATTERY LIFE EVEN WITHOUT HAVING BASIC KNOWLEDGE. YOU KEEP YOUR GPS ON , EMAIL SYNCHRONIZATION TO ""PUSH ITEM AS THEY ARRIVE"" AND ALL APPS RUNNING IN BACKGROUND ,THEY HOW CAN YOU EXPECT GOOD BATTERY LIFE? NO PHONE WILL GIVE A LONG BATTERY LIFE WITH ALL THOSE THINGS ON. JUST ON LOCATION WHEN NEEDED AND USE MAIL SYNCHRONIZATION TO HALF AN HOUR OR MORE .
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST 2 MONTHS AND NOT A SINGLE TIME I FACED HANGING PROBLEM. I WOULD SUGGEST JUST GO FOR THIS PHONE.DON'T GET TROLLED BY THESE STUPID PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN HAVE BASIC KNOWLEDGE AND COMMENT EVEN WITHOUT USING SOMETHING."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"USING IT FROM THE PAST 18 DAYS.SINCE IT HAVEN'T LAGGED AT-LEAST ONCE.THE BEST PHONE UNDER 10 K.I BROUGHT IT FOR 9.5 K FOR ME AND IN 6 DAYS PRICE DROPPED TO 8.4 K.BUT I BROUGHT ONE PHONE FOR MY FRIEND THEN.AND AFTER PRICE HIKED AGAIN TO 9.8 K :D.MY FRIEND IS LUCKY GOT THIS PHONE FOR JUST 8.4 K.BUT IT WORTH 10 K,REALLY.U'LL NEVER REGRET ABOUT PHONE.AND ITS SOOO GOOD LOOKING PHONE.EVEN BETTER LOOKS THAN LUMIA 620.

      2. U CAN'T ADJUST BRIGHTNESS MANUALLY  LIKE ANDROID ONLY THREE OPTIONS THERE HIGH, NORMAL,
      
      LOW . ( MY PAST PHONE GALAXY CHAT PHONE I CONTROL BRIGHTNESS MANUALLY  MINUS AND
      
      PLUS, I ONLY USE 25 OR 30% BRIGHTNESS FOR GOOD BATTERY BACKUP BUT IN LUMIA 520 NO
      
      MANUALLY OPTION)
      
      3. NO HOME SCREEN WALL PAPER.
      
      
      4. NO OPERA MINI AND OPERA MOBILE ( I KNOW INTERNET XPLORER AND UC BROWSER IS THERE BUT I
      
      USE MOSTLY OPERA MINI, UC BROWSER IS GOOD FOR DOWNLOADING)
      
      
      5. NO EQUALIZER FOR MUSIC ( IF THIS PHONE WAS ANDROID THEN I CAN EASILY DOWNLOAD MUSIC
      
      EQUALISER)
      
      
      6. NO FILE MANAGER OR APPLICATION MANAGER.
      
      
      I'M WAITING FOR AMBER UPDATE GDR2 UPDATE COMING IN AUGUST AFTER THAT 8.1 BLUE IN 2014. HOPE WINDOW SOLVE THIS  PROBLEMS
      
      
      IF U WANT ANDROID BUDGET SMART PHONE WITH GOOD BRAND THEN GO FOR LG L5 II OR LG L5 II DUAL. IF U WANT WINDOW BUDGET PHONE THEN NOKIA LUMIA 520 BEST."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"VERY GOOD PHONE IF YOU ARE NOT OBSESSED WITH ANDROID OS. THE WINDOWS OS LOOKS ATTRACTIVE THOUGH YOU CANNOT CUSTOMIZE IT BEYOND AN EXTENT.THE PHONE IS SLEEK, LOOKS ELEGANT AND VERY RESPONSIVE. DEFINITELY A BUY FOR THIS AMOUNT."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"WAS GOING TO BOOK A PIECE FOR 8899 BUCKS THIS MORNING BUT SUDDENLY IT BECAME 9801 BUCKS!!
      
      I WANT FLIPKART TO INFORM ME WHEN THE PRICE OF THE BLACK MODEL TURNS DOWN A BIT.
      
      I HAVE USED IT FROM MY COUSIN FOR A DAY OR TWO...
      
      IT FEELS GUD IN HAND..
      
      PEOPLE NOTICE YOUR PHONE ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE!
      
      YOU ARE GETTING WINDOWS 8 IN LESS THAN 10K!!!! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT???
      
      AWESOME EXPERIENCE!!
      
      ITS USELESS TO HAVE A FM RADIO WHEN YOU HAVE NOKIA MUSIC!!!!
      
      CAMERA QUALITY, 512MB RAM, 8GB INTERNAL MEMORY, 64GB EXTERNAL SUPPORT, 1GHZ PROCESSOR ARE TOO MUCH IN THIS PRICE...
      
      I HAVE USED XPERIA AND MANY OTHER ANDROIDS BUT BELIEVE ME WIN8 IS THE BEST. YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING IT.
      
      ABOUT THE APPS THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTED IN WIN8 BUT IN ANDROID, THEY WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE FOR WIN8 WIT FLOURISHING OF THE MODEL!
      
      LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST IT YOU ARE A GADGET FREAK WITH A LIMITED WALLET AND LOVE HIGH SPECS PHONES, ITS MADE FOR YOU! GO FOR IT WITHOUT A 2ND THOUGHT!"
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"WELL FIRSTLY I DIDNT BUY THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AS IT WAS OUT OF STOCK WHEN I BOUGHT THIS...
      
      
      MOST OF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE ANDROID LOYALISTS TRIED TO DISCOURAGE ME FROM BUYING THIS LITTLE BEAST BUT AFTER ONE AND A HALF MONTHS OF RIGOROUS USE I AM EXTREMELY SATISFIED THAT I STUCK TO MY CHOICE...
      
      
      I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WRITING NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND RATING THIS PHONE 1 OUT OF 5 STARS BUT TRUST ME THEY SURELY HAVE NOT USED THIS PHONE AND LETS IGNORE THEM....
      
      
      ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS THEIR HAVE BEEN MANY REVIEWS SO I WILL NOT GO INTO DETAILS I WILL JUST POINT OUT 2-3 SIGNIFICANT FEATURES..
      
      
      FIRSTLY THIS PLATFORM DOESNT NEED ANTIVIRUSES AS ALL APPS ARE SANDBOXED AND THUS NO VIRUSES CAN AFFECT THIS PHONE SIMILARLY NO ANTIVIRUSES CAN WORK ON THIS PHONE..ITS ACTUALLY A GREAT THING WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MINIMIZING LAGS CREATED BY MALWARES...
      
      
      SECONDLY THE WINDOWS STORE IS A CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOPING AND GROWING ONE OF A KIND APP STORE IN WHICH ALL THE APPS NEEDS OF THE USER ARE FULFILLED AND THAT ALSO WITH WINDOWS CERTIFIED APPS UNLIKE ANDROID WHERE ANYBODY WHO CAN CODE FOR THE LINUX KERNEL CAN UPLOAD APPS THUS THE APPS ARE MORE SECURE AND TRUSTWORTHY...
      
      
      THE TOUCH THE METRO UI THE APPS INTEGRATION AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT BUT ONLY THE BATTERY IS A SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDE HOWEVER ONCE YOU GET A HOLD OF THE PHONE AND THE OS YOU EVENTUALLY LEARN TO USE THE BATTERY WISELY TO LAST YOU 16-18 HOURS INSPITE OF GAMING MODERATELY..
      
      
      A FEW APPS LIKE VIBER, TALKING TOM AND WHATSAPP NEED IMMEDIATE UPGRADES AND I DONT KNOW WHY THEY HAVENT BEEN UPDATED FOR A LONG TIME...
      
      
      IT IS A LITTLE BEAST THAT SERVES YOU WELL AND IS BY FAR THE BEST SMARTPHONE OUT THERE IN THIS PRICE RANGE AND AFTERALL NOKIA AND WINDOWS ARE TWO OF THE MOST RELIABLE BRANDS IN THE MARKET....GUYS WHO ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS BABY CAN DO SO WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHTS...
      
      
      FLIPKART IS ACTUALLY OFFERING THIS PHONE FOR A PRICE THAT IS LOWER THAN MARKET PRICES....
      
      
      ONE MORE THING FOR PEOPLE USING THIS PHONE GUYS TEMPLE RUN 1 IS AVAILABLE IN THE STORE AND IT RUNS VERY SMOOTH AND TEMPLE RUN 2 WILL BE UPLOADED VERY SOON AND A VERY IMPORTANT AND USEFUL UPDATE WILL BE AVAILABLE NEXT MONTH WHICH WILL ENHANCE THE USER EXPERIENCE QUITE A FEW NOTCHES....."
Nokia Lumia 520,5,"WHY SHOULD YOU GO FOR IT???
      
      1. IT'S NOKIA...RELIABILITY
      
      2. AWESOMENESS OF WINDOWS 8 (FAR BEYOND ANDROID)...HATS OFF TO MICROSOFT FOR CREATING SUCH A THING
      
      3. LUMIA CAMERA WITH LOTS OF IN BUILT AND EXTENDABLE FEATURES..."

      CONS:-
      
      1 WHATS APP. TRULLY POOR IN USE IN 520 :( AND NOT VIDEO SHARING AND AUDIO ONLY RECORDING.. :(
      
      2. BLUTOOTH MUSIC AND VIDEO NOT AVAILABLE."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AT A VERY GOOD PRICE. NICE AND HANDY THE YELLOW COLOUR JUSTS ' FLIPS ' YOU OVER! POWERFUL AMD ATTRACTIVE. USEFUL AND FULFILLING.SOMETIMES ONE GOES ALL OVER THE PLACE TO FIND A PRODUCT WHEN IT IS JUST IN FRONT OF YOU. FLIPKART DID A GREAT JOB. AND DELIVERY -EXCELLENT. IN NO TIME IT IS IN YOUR HANDS..

      10) YOU R GETTING DUAL CORE UNDER 9500...

      MOST OF ABOVE DISADVANTAGES GET RESOLVED IN ""NOKIA LUMIA 620"" .. SO DECIDE WHAT TO DO...GOOD LUCK...."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"AFTER MY 10 WEEKS OF USAGE:
      
      A 1 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND 512 MB RAM, SUPER SENSITIVE TOUCH, AN ABOVE AVERAGE BATTERY, 4 INCH SCREEN, SURPRISINGLY GOOD CAMERA EVEN WITHOUT FLASH, 8 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND ONE OF THE MOST USER FRIENDLY OS.
      
      GUYS, THIS NOKIA DEVICE DOESN'T NEED A REVIEW. IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO COMPETITION. ITS A COMPLETE VALUE FOR MONEY DEVICE.
      
      ITS TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
      
      
      MINOR PROBLEM:  WP8 NEEDS SOME OF THE BASIC APPS SUCH AS GTALK AND 3RD PARTY APPS SUCH AS THOSE FROM BANKS, IRCTC, NGPAY ETC.
      
      
      FLIPKART GAVE A SATISFACTORY SERVICE. DEVICE REACHED ME IN 3 DAYS TIME."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"AFTER USING SAMSUNG MOBILES FOR LAST FEW YEARS, I DECIDED TO SWITCH BACK TO NOKIA AND I WISHED TO TRY OUT A WINDOWS PHONE. THIS PHONE CAME IN HANDY FOR ME FOR ITS AFFORDABLE PRICE AND GOOD SPECIFICATIONS. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR THE LAST ONE MONTH NOW AND DON'T REGRET FOR PURCHASING IT. ITS REALLY GOOD AND FEELS BETTER.
      
      
      ITS A GOOD PRODUCT FROM NOKIA."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"AWESOME PHONE IN ITS PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      THE ONE I INITIALLY GOT FROM FLIPKART HAD A PROBLEM WITH ITS CAMERA KEY. GOT THE SAME REPLACED BY FLIPKART, AND THE REPLACEMENT ARRIVED WITH IN THREE DAYS SO KHUDOS TO THE FLIPKART TEAM!.
      
      
      THE ONLY CON I FOUND WITH THIS PHONE IS WINDOWS STORE, THE APPS AVAILABLE ARE SERIOUSLY LIMITED WHEN COMPARED WITH ANDROID, FOR EXAMPLE BANKING APP FOR ICICI BANK IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS 8, APP FOR MY WORK RELATED EMAIL IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS 8, MUSIC PLAYERS AVAILABLE ON WINDOWS STORE ARE NOT GOOD ETC.
      
      
      NOKIA'S HERE MAPS ARE AWESOME AND NOKIA MUSIC APP IS GREAT FOR DOWNLOADING SONGS.
      
      
      DEFINITELY A BUY IN ITS PRICE RANGE!."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,BATTERY BACKUP SHOULD BE MORE....!! REST EVERYTHING IS AS SMOOTH AS BUTTER !! THE PHONE IS HAVING ONE PROBLEM THAT IS WHEN YOU PRESS THE LOCK BUTTON IT MUCH NOT WORK MANY TIMES....BUT YES IS A VERY GOOD PHONE UNDER 10000 !! WINDOWS 8 ROCKS !! AND NOKIA LUMIA 520 SCREEN IS THE BEST !!
Nokia Lumia 520,4,DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY. YOU CANT EXPECT EXPECT ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS WITHIN 10K. NOKIA'S QUALITY COUPLED WITH WINDOWS' METRO UI MAKES IT A MUST-BUY SMARTPHONE FOR GUYS LOOKING FOR A BUDGET SMARTPHONE. GO FOR IT GUYS
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"DOES THIS PHONE WORKS ALL .EXE FILES? EXAMPLE LIKE "" LIPPINCOTT'S REVIEW FOR NCLEX-RN 8TH EDITION "" AND ""SAUNDERS COMPREHENSIVE NCLEX-RN REVIEW 4E"" THESE ARE WORKING ON MY PC WHICH ARE TAKEN FROM SYSTEM CD'S....... PLEASE HELP ME"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"EVEN THO THIS PHONE IS PRICED TO ATTRACT THE FIRST TIME SMARTPHONE BUYERS, I WOULD SUGGEST THEM TO STEER CLEAR. WINDOWS DOESN'T GIVE YOU HALF THE FLEXIBILITY OF ANDROID. AS A FIRST TIME SMARTPHONE USER, YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THE POWER OF THESE DEVICES IF YOU START WITH A WINDOWS DEVICE. THE LIMITATIONS ESTABLISHED BY WINDOWS PHONE 8 ENVIRONMENT ALLOW FOR A DEVICE WHICH IS HIGHLY ORGANIZED. ITS A NO FUSS USER INTERFACE, WHICH IS BUILT QUITE BEAUTIFULLY. THEN NOKIA HAS DONE WHAT IT DOES VERY WELL. BUILD QUALITY IS VERY NICE. HERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS I FACED WITH THE SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE RECTIFIED WITH EITHER AN EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS (FREE AND PAID) OR YOU CAN FIND A WORK AROUND:
      
      
      1. FACEBOOK INTEGRATION DOESN'T HAVE OPTION FOR INBOX MESSAGING USERS(GET FB APP)
      
      2. IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE NUMBERS SAVED, CAN'T SMS ON NUMBERS OTHER THAN DEFAULT NO (AT LEAST I COULDN'T. FIXED WITH RAP DIALER APP)
      
      3. NOT ALL APPS THAT CLAIM TO HAVE LIVE TILE WIDGETS CAN PROVIDE TILES WHICH ACTUALLY UPDATE LIVE
      
      4. THE SEARCH BUTTON TAKES YOU TO ONLY BING SEARCH. ITS A WHOLE BUTTON WASTED
      
      5. CAN'T FIND AN APP THAT WOULD CAUSE MY WHOLE SCREEN TO GO WHITE SO THAT I CAN USE IT TO SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THE FLOOR IN THE DARK. (I HAD THIS TYPE OF APP ON ADROID PHONE, WHICH DIDN'T HAVE LED, LIKE THIS LUMIA DOESNT)
      
      6. CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXIT MUSIC PLAYER ONCE AND FOR ALL. (I THINK I CAN ONLY PAUSE IT)
      
      7. THE WHOLE FONE IS VERY DATA HUNGRY. ALL APPS ARE DATA INTENSIVE.
      
      8. CAN'T CANCEL DOWNLOADS FROM APP STORE
      
      9. CAN'T DRAG ALONG THE SONG TIMELINE TO GO FWD/BACKWARDS (CAN HOLD DOWN FWD AND BACK KEY)
      
      10. THE VOLUME, SCREEN LOCK, AND CAMERA BUTTONS DON'T SEEM TOO GREAT WHEN PRESSED.
      
      11. NO BACK LIGHT FOR THE SCREEN BUTTONS WOULD HAVE HELPED (THIS COST CUTTING MEASURE IS NOT COOL)
      
      12. NO LED/BUTTON LIGHT FOR SMS/CALL/MAIL NOTIFICATIONS (IS IRRITATING, COULD HAVE BEEN FIXED WITH BACK LIT SENSITIVE BUTTONS)
      
      13. A LOTTA UPDATES REQUIRED FOR COMMON APPS LIKE WATS APP, FACEBOOK.
      
      14. A LOT MORE INTEGRATION POSSIBLE WITH CALENDAR, FB, TWITTER, ETC. - MICROSOFT AND NOKIA CAN AND SHOULD UPDATE THESE THINGS)
      
      
      THE PHONE HAS LITTLE CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS, BUT THEY ARE PLENTY FOR A PERSON WHO USES A PHONE, AND NOT PLAYS WITH ONE."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"FED UP WITH ANDROID.??? GO FOR LUMIA.. ....................................

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"FELLOW FLIPKARTERS..!!
      
      
      I'M NOT HERE TO WRITE ALL THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PHONE. THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE BY MANY BEFORE. WHAT I WANNA SAY IS THAT, I OBSERVED MOST OF THE REVIEWS ARE NOT ACTUALLY ""REVIEWS"". DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE WRITE EVERYTHING THAT COMES TO THEIR MIND. ART OF REVIEWING OR BEING A CRITIC NEEDS SOME SKILLS TO LOOK INTO THINGS PROFOUNDLY. I HERE BY WANNA LIST SOME LINES THAT FELLOW REVIEWERS WROTE IN THEIR REVIEWS WHICH WERE ACTUALLY FUNNY IN A WAY.
      
      
      # ""THERE IS NO SECONDARY CAMERA IN THIS PHONE""
      
      - C'MON GUYS.. IT'S LIKE YOU WENT TO A BOLLYWOOD MOVIE AND SAYING THAT BRAD PITT IS MISSING IN THIS MOVIE. THIS IS BOTTOM VERSION OF WINDOWS8.
      
      
      # ""PICTURES TAKEN AT LOW LIGHT ARE NOT CRISP""
      
      - IT'S CLEARLY STATED THAT THERE IS NO LED FLASH FOR CAMERA. STILL I DONNO WHICH MORON TRIES TO TAKE PICS IN DULL LIGHT WITH THIS BUDGET PHONE.
      
      
      # ""TEMPLE RUN DOESN'T WORK SMOOTH""
      
      - YOU ARE ON CITY ROADS AND YOU WANT TO HIT YOUR TOP SPEED?? GET ONTO AN HIGHWAY BRO.. KEEP IN MIND THAT U PAID ONLY 10 GRAND FOR THIS PHONE.
      
      ................................................................................................................................
      
      
      CRITICISM IS NOT A KIDS PLAY. BETTER CONCENTRATE ON DEFECTS IN WHAT YOU GOT RATHER THAN COMPLAINING WHAT IS MISSING. OR IF YOU THINK THAT THERE IS A BETTER OPTION THAN THIS PHONE WITHIN THE PRICE RANGE, THEN NAME IT AND COMPARE IT.
      
      THANKYOU.

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"FIRST FAST DELIVERY BY FLIPKART IN TWO DAYS.SECOND THE PRICE OF 9099 IS BEST PRICE OFFERED FOR THIS PHONE. NOW FOR THE PHONE FIRST THING ITS OS, ITS VERY FRESH BREAKING MONOTONOUS OF ANDROID PHONE GOOD BATTERY LIFE ONLY CONCERN IS APPS WHICH ARE COMING AND THAT TO FREE.MOST APPS I USED ON MY ANDROID PHONE ARE AVAILABLE ON WINDOWS PLATFORM. IN BUILT CAMERA APPS IN THE PHONE ARE EXCELLENT. VERY GOOD PHONE FOR 9K NOKIA MAY BE BACK WITH THIS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"FIRST THING FIRST, I ORDERED THIS PHONE THROUGH FLIP KART, AND I GOT MY PHONE IN 2.5 DAYS. VERY GOOD SERVICE.
      
      
      REGARDING PHONE, COUPLE OF YEARS BACK I WAS NOKIA PHONE LOVER DUE TO THEIR GREAT HARDWARE QUALITY, BUT NOKIA PHONE USER INTERFACE WAS NOT IMPRESSIVE AT ALL.
      
      
      AFTER LONG TIME, I JUST WANTED TO TRY OUT WITH WINDOWS PHONE AS WELL AS NOKIA, AND WHEN I GOT LUMIA 520 WITH WINDOWS 8, I CAN SAY NOKIA IS BACK IN PHONE MARKET. LUMIA 520 HAS AMAZING QUALITY OF HARDWARE AS WELL USER INTERFACE, I REALLY LOVED ITS USER INTERFACE AND THE WAY IT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED, VERY SMOOTH TOUCH SCREEN ( SUPER SENSITIVE). I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE MORE EXPERIMENT FROM NOKIA THAT WOULD MAKE THEM TO BECOME NO 1 IN MARKET AGAIN."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"FIRSTLY, FLIPKART DELIVERY IS OUTSTANDING. KUDOS FLIPKART.
      
      
      SECONDLY, NOKIA IS GETTING BACK ON THE LEAGUE.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      -BUILD QUALITY IS VERY GOOD.
      
      -CAMERA IS CRISP. NO FLASH THOUGH.
      
      -THE TOUCH ALMOST FEELS LIKE YOU ARE USING AN IPHONE. ALMOST THERE. THE ON SCREEN KEYPAD IS VERY INTUITIVE. SOMETIME I DON'T EVEN TOUCH THE SCREEN, JUST COME VERY CLOSE AND IT DOES IT FOR YOU, VERY SENSITIVE.
      
      -DECENT DUAL CORE PERFORMANCE. NOT FOR HIGH END GAMERS.
      
      -OFFICE AND HERE MAPS ARE GREAT.
      
      -APPS, SUFFICIENT FOR NORMAL USER WHO IS NOT WORRIED ABOUT MORE FUNCTIONALITY. MANY APPS ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND RELEASED. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.
      
      -LOOK, FEEL AND COLOURS ARE AWESOME.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      -NO FRONT CAM, HOW MUCH CAN WE ASK AT THIS PRICE RANGE.
      
      -CANT MEET UPTO IOS, ANDROID WITH RESPECTS TO APPS.
      
      -WP8, WOULD STILL NEED SOME UPGRADES AND TWEAKS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE CANNOT SWITCH OFF AUTO ROTATION. THIS IS BASIC THING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
      
      -512 RAM, THOUGH I DON'T FEEL THIS IS LESS, BUT HIGH END GAMES MIGHT NOT RUN. AGAIN CONSIDERING THE PRICE RANGE, CAN'T EXPECT EVERYTHING.
      
      -NO IN-EAR HEADPHONES.
      
      
      HAPPY SURFING!!"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"FOLKS,
      
      IT IS INTERESTING TO READ THE COMMENTS ON 520 HERE. YOU PAY 9999 INR AND EXPECTING A 20K + EXPERIENCE AND FEATURES FROM THIS PHONE? NO WAY. I AM USING THIS FOR THE LAST ONE MONTH. THERE IS NO HANGING PROBLEM FOR THIS LUMIA PACK, SINCE IT RUNS WITH DUAL CORE 1 GHZ PROCESSOR ITS PRETTY FAST TOO.
      
      
      THE PHONE WEIGHS VERY LIGHT WITH 125 GM AND IT IS DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY IT LOOKS SLIM WITH ITS 9.9 MM WIDTH. THE BACK CASE MIGHT LOOK A BIT PLASTICY, BUT LOOKWISE IT GIVES A CLASSY LOOK FOR THIS PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      THE PHONE HAS A 233 PPI SCREEN OF 4 INCH SIZE. IT OFFERS A GOOD VIEW OF COLORS ON IT. THE SCREEN SURFACE QUALITY IS A BIT LOW COMPARED TO OTHER LUMIAS INTHE FRONT. SCROLLING UP AND DOWN THE START SCREEN IS SMOOTH THAN EXPECTED.
      
      
      THE CAMERA OFFERS A DECENT PACKAGE WITH THE PRICE RANGE. STILL, THEY COULD HAVE ADDED A FLASH UNIT. IT CAPTURES GOOD IMAGES IN THE DAYLIGHT WHERE WE HAVE AN OPTION TO CHANGETHE ISO TILL 400 FOR LOW LIGHT AND ALSO HAVE GOOD EXPOSURE VALUES. WITH THE UPCOMING AMBER UPDATE NOKIA PROMISES ISO RATE INCREASE TILL 3000 AND MORE SMART CAMERA OPTIONS. THE VIDEO CAPTURING QUALITY IS GOOD WITH 720P.
      
      
      THERE WILL BE SYNCHRONISING ISSUES IF YOU ARE NOT USING A PROPER MICRO SIM CARD. MOST OF US USE A PUNCHED SIM CARD. GUESS A PROPER MICRO SIM CARD WILL RECTIFY THE MINOR SYNC PROB OF MAIL ACCOUNTS, FACEBOOK AND BING LOCK SCREEN UPDATE.
      
      
      THOUGH 520 DOESN'T SUPPORT ALL FORMATS OF VIDEO PLAYBACK, IT RUNS VIDEO WITHOUT ANY LAG. BIGFLIX OFFERS ONLINE STREAMING AND DOWNLOADING, BUT SINCE WE HAVE A CARDLOT AND MASS STORAGE OPTION WE CAN EASILY TRANSFER MOVIE FILES TO THE LUMIA VIA USB.
      
      
      NOKIA MUSIC IS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LUMIA SERIES. 80 LAKH SONGS IS AN AWESOME COLLECTION. BUT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SHORT TIME FREE SUBSCRIPTION WITH LUMIA 520. IT'S ONLY FOR 3 MONTHS. THERE IS ALWAYS AN OPTION TO GET A NEW VOUCHER THOUGH.
      
      
      COMING TO APPLICATIONS AND GAMES, IT IS AN UNDENIABLE FACT THAT GOOGLE PLAY AND IOS HAVE MORE APPS, BUT FOR A NORMAL HUMAN BEING APPS IN WINDOWS PHONE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH. STILL THERE IS ALWAYS A DREAM OF GETTING GOOGLE SERVICES OFFICIALLY TO WINDOWS STORE.
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS WORTH FOR 9999 INR. IT OFFERS GOOD SPECS FOR THE PRICE RANGE. FOR A NEW SMARTPHONE USER THIS IS A GOOD START. FOR SUPER SMART PHONES YOU NEED BIGGER BUDGET AND 20 + IN YOUR WALLET.
      
      
      FINALLY, WE ALL SHOULD KNOW IT IS AFTER ALL A PHONE, NOT A COMPUTER AND YOU ARE GETTING IT FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE. FOR THOSE ARE FACING STRANGE TROUBLES, TRY TO EXPLORE YOUR PHONE GIVING AMPLE TIME OR VISIT NOKIA CARE"

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"GO FOR NOKIA LUMIA 520 BECAUSE ITS WINDOWS 8 OS IS BETTER THAN ANDROID ICS OS FOR THE SAME HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS. THERE IS NO LAG PRESENT AND ITS OS IS BUTTERY SMOOTH TO OPERATE. MOST OF THE POPULAR APPS ARE AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH, I OBSERVED MOST OF THE GAMES ARE PAID VERSION ONLY. NOKIA MUSIC STORE PROVIDES A LARGE COLLECTION OF SONGS WHICH ARE FREE TO DOWNLOAD. ALSO, WITH YOUTUBE DOWNLOADER APP, ONE CAN DOWNLOAD ANY VIDEO (EVEN HD QUALITY) FOR FREE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, IF NORMAL SIM CARD WAS SUPPORTED BY THE PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"GOOD PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER THE CAMERA KEY WAS NON FUNCTIONAL. READ FROM INTERNET THAT MANY OTHERS WERE FACING SIMILAR PROBLEM.REMOVING THE BACK COVER AND RE-FITTING WAS OF NO HELP. FINALLY,FLIPKART REPLACED THE ITEM. CAMERA IS NOT THAT GOOD IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS. I WISH THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE APPS. AN APP IS NEEDED TO USE THE FLIP COVER. OTHERWISE A GOOD PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"GREAT PHONE, 3G WORKS VERY WELL! LOOKS AND DESIGN ARE AWESOME! APPS LOOK GREAT! LARGE SCREEN, GREAT COLORED THEMES TO CHOOSE FOR.
      
      BUT...1) CAMERA IS UNDERWHELMING! NO FLASH OR FRONT CAMERA.
      
      2) UNAVAILABILITY OF FREE GAMES AND FM RADIO!"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"HELLO GUYS. PRIOR TO BUYING MY LUMIA 520, SEVERAL PEOPLE GAVE ME ADVICE THAT I SHOULD GO FOR ANDROID PHONE BECAUSE WINDOWS DOES NOT HAVE MUCH APPS ETC. I REVIEWED A LOT ABOUT MOBILE PHONES. MY BUDGET WAS AROUND 15K. SO HAVE OPTIONS OF NOKIA 520, 620, CANVAS 2 , CANVAS HD AND SAMSUMG QUATRO. CERTAINLY AFTER GAINING EXPERIENCE I WILL NEVER PREFER MICROMAX OR OTHER CHINESE BRANDS BECAUSE I AM SURE AFTER SOME TIME UR PHONE WILL TROUBLE U. I NEED SMART PHONE HAVING REASONABLE  SIZE TO FIT MY POCKET AND SAME TIME SHOULD ENTERTAIN ME AS WELL. FINALLY I BOUGHT MY LUMIA 520.

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"HERE IS A WORD OF CAUTION FOR FUTURE LUMIA 520 BUYERS,
      
      
      INDEED IT IS AN ATTRACTIVE SMARTPHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE, GOOD SCREEN, DISPLAY AWESOME TOUCH AND WINDOWS PHONE OS ROCKS. BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN MINOR ISSUES WHICH SOME USERS FIND IRRITATING. THE MAIN ISSUE IS : ALL THE HARD BUTTONS NAMELY, POWER BUTTON, VOLUME BUTTON AND CAMERA BUTTON ARE PLACED ON THE BACK COVER ITSELF.
      
      
      ONCE YOU REMOVE THE BACK COVER, YOU NEED TO PLACE IT BACK REALLY CAREFULLY OTHERWISE THOSE BUTTON WON'T WORK. ALSO, THERE IS A CHANCE THAT CAMERA BUTTON MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE PICTURES OR UNABLE TO AUTOFOCUS(WHICH HAPPENS WHEN YOU PRESS THE CAMERA BUTTON HALF-WAY). PLEASE CHECK THIS ISSUE. THERE ARE MANY USERS WHO FACED THIS ISSUE IN LUMIA 520.
      
      
      GOOGLE FOR CAMERA BUTTON ISSUES IN LUMIA 520 AND YOU CAN FIND MANY USERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS ISSUE THERE.
      
      
      EXCEPT FOR THIS ISSUE, THIS PHONE IS AWESOME. JUST CHECK THE CAMERA BUTTON BEFORE PURCHASING.

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"HEY GUYS, THIS IS THE BEST PHONE YOU CAN HAVE FOR THIS PRICE RANGE. L 520 COMES WITH EXCELLENT DISPLAY AND BEAUTIFUL DESIGN. BUT A LITTLE CARELESSNESS WILL PUT IN TROUBLE.. I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND WITH IN A WEEK DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR.. AS THE DISPLAY IS VERY OPEN, THE SCREEN GOT BROKE. AND DINT GET ANY WARRANTY AS EXPECTED, COSTING ME 2500.. SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WILL PUT ON SCREEN GUARD OR FLIP COVER ONCE YOU GET THIS PHONE ON HAND.."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"HI ALL LUMIA 520 USERS....
      
      
      THIS IS MY FIRST ORDER IN FLIPKART AND VERY MUCH HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE WITH FLIPKART... SHIPPING WAS MADE WITHIN ONE DAY.
      
      
      I HAD A PROBLEM IN MY LUMIA 520. WHEN EVER I INSERT MY HEADPHONE, ANY ONE OF THE SPEAKER IS WORKING. WHEN I CHECKED THE HEADPHONE, IT WAS IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION WITH OTHER MOBILE. BUT, IN SOME CASES, WHEN I INSERT THE HEADPHONE JACK PARTIALLY, BOTH THE SPEAKERS WORKS WELL BUT NOT THE MIC...MY FRIEND SUGGESTED TO DO RESTART BY PRESSING THE DOWN VOL &AMP; POWER BUTTON AND AFTER MOBILE GOT RESTARTED IT GOT RECTIFIED... NOW BOTH THE SPEAKERS ARE WORKING WELL...
      
      
      REST OF THE THINGS, THIS MOBILE IS OSM OSM OSM... ONCE AGAIN, I WISH FLIPKART TO CONTINUE THIS SERVICE..."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"HI FOLKS,
      
      DONT LISTEN TO OTHERS.. JUST GO FOR IT.. BATTERY SEEMS LITTLE LOW ...
      
      FLIPKART SERVICE IS AWESOME AS ALWAYS.. I HAD ORDERED IT ON MON AND RECEIVED IT ON NEXT DAY..
      
      
      JUST GO FOR IT.  JUST GO FOR IT.  JUST GO FOR IT.  JUST GO FOR IT."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"HI,
      
      
      IT WAS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE, SHOPPING WITH FK ALWAYS. I HAVE ORDERED MANY THINGS FROM THIS ONLINE SHOP AND GOT NICE EXPERIENCE OF SHOPPING IN TERMS OF TIMELY DELIVERY AND THE WAY OF TRACKING DELIVERY SYSTEM.
      
      
      ABOUT THE PRODUCT:
      
      ITS VERY TOUGH THESE DAYS TO RATE ANY OF THE MOBILE SET WHICH ARE HAVING THEIR LIFE SPAN OF JUST IN MONTHS.
      
      ALTHOUGH, I AM WRITING FEW POINTS WHICH CAN HELP ANY USER:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. NICE LOOK, VERY HANDY AND VIBRANT COLORS (IF YOU LIKE)
      
      2. BUILD QUALITY, CAMERA QUALITY (WITHOUT FLASH ITS EXPECTED QUALITY)
      
      3. NOKIA TRUST YOU WILL FIND THEIR IN THIS SET
      
      4. WINDOWS WP8 ...ALMOST NO HANGING ISSUE WHICH NOW A DAYS COMMON WITH ANDROID OR ANY OTHER LOW RANGE PHONES.
      
      5.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. NO FLASH AND FRONT CAM (OBVIOUS IN THIS PRICE)
      
      2. SCREEN QUALITY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
      
      3. MICRO SIM, SINCE ITS INTERFACE TIME FOR MINI AND MICRO SIM PEOPLE CAN FEEL PROB TO SWITCHING MOBILES.

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"I AM A BIG FAN OF NOKIA AND I ALWAYS PREFER NOKIA BECAUSE OF THE BATTERY. I HAVE PURCHASED LUMIA 520 AND I WAS REALLY HURT AT THE QUALITY OF THE BATTERY. IT HARDLY LASTS 7 HOURS. GUYS DON'T BUY LUMIA 520. OTHER THAN THE BATTERY, THE TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS REALLY GOOD. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE APPS IN A WINDOWS PHONE. IT HAS THE BASIC APPS WHICH WE USE FOR OUR DAY TO DAY PURPOSE. BUT SERIOUSLY THE BATTERY IS THE WORST WHICH I HAVE EVER SEEN....."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,I AM USING IT FROM LAST 1 MONTH. THE PROCESSING SPEED IS GOOD AND INTERNET SPEED @3G NOTWORK IS AWESOME. HEADPHONES ARE NOT GOOD BUT SOUND OUTPUT IS GOOD. WINDOW FEATURES MADE IT BEST IN CLASS. MUCH BETTER THAN ANDROID PHONES.
Nokia Lumia 520,4,I AM USING LUMIA 520 AND M HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND FEATURES OF THIS SMART PHONE. I AM LINUX ADMIN BUT BY USING THIS PHONE NOW LOVING WINDOWS 8. IT'S A LOVELY AND VERY FAST OS. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE FOR THE PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO HAVE NOT ENOUGH BUDGET FOR BUYING A WELL FEATURED SMART PHONE. BEST PHONE BELOW 10K. LAST BUT NOT LEAST IT'S SUPERB.
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"I AM USING LUMIA 520 FROM LAST ONE MONTH :
      
      PRO :
      
      1. EASILY ACCESS INTERNET.
      
      2. EASILY ACCESS EMAILS (GMAIL, YAHOO, OUTLOOK, SKYDRIVE).
      
      3. GOOD SOUND QUALITY &AMP; ROBUST ( IT'S DROP FROM MY HAND TWO TIMES).
      
      4. LOT OF GOOD APP IN WINDOW STORE &AMP; UNLIMITED MUSIC NOKIA STORE.
      
      5. IT'S WORK WITHOUT ANY REBOOT, THANKS TO WINDOWS 8.0
      
      6. OFFICE 365 ROCK.
      
      5. VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      1. BATTERY LIFE,  CHARGE IT AFTER 2 DAYS.
      
      2. CAMERA IS POOR QUALITY &AMP; INITIALLY I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH CAMERA BUTTON ALSO.
      
      3. IN EMAIL YOU CAN ATTACH PHOTO BUT CANNOT ATTACH WORD,EXCEL, PDF DOCUMENT
      
      ( VERY BIG LIMITATION, I NEED TO CHECK / SEND OFFICE MAIL FROM PHONE)."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"I BOUGHT LUMIA 520 (RED) FROM UNIVERSEL MOBILES FOR 10500. I DO INDEED REGRET NOT BUYING FROM FLIPKART.
      
      
      HARDWARE
      
      DAMN GOOD HARDWARE..........THAT IS ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT IT NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ABOUT MICROMAX, INTEX , XOLO, KARBON ETC...
      
      
      SOFTWARE
      
      POOSITIVES:
      
      1. WINDOWS 8 IS GOOD IN ALL MANNER.
      
      2. MOST OF THE FAMOUS APPS ARE AVAILABLE.
      
      3. GPS AND GLONASS COMBINATION IS THE BEST I HAVE SEEN. IT CAN LOCATE ITSELF WITHIN SAY    5-10 SECONDS.
      
      
      NEGATIVES
      
      I WAS A PREVIOUS HTC EXPLORER USER WHICH IS NOTHING COMPARED TO LUMIA 520 IN TERMS OF HARDWARE. BUT HTC HAS THE BEST UI COMPARED TO SONY, SAMSUNG AND NOKIA.
      
      
      FEATURES IN HTC EXPLORER THAT HAVE BEEN MISSED IN LUMIA 520
      
      1. THERE ARE SEPARATE VOLUME CONTROLS FOR MUSIC AND PHONE CALLS.
      
      
      2. THE CAPACITIVE TOUCH KEY (SEARCH BUTTON) CAN BE USED FOR DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS IN EACH AREA ( FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IN MESSAGES IT CAN SEARCH FOR A PARTICULAR TEXT WITHIN INBOX, WHEN IN START SCREEN IT OPENS UP BROWSER, WHEN IN ALL APPS, IT CAN SEARCH FOR A PARTICULAR APP.......ETC)
      
      
      3. ALSO THE CONTACT SEARCH IS BY FAR THE BEST
      
      
      4. SWYPE KEYBOARD IS VERY GOOD.
      
      
      5. ALSO THE MUSIC PLAYER IS GOOD."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"I BOUGHT THIS SET FROM FK 15 DAYS BACK...DELIVERY WAS FAST AS USUAL WITHIN 3 DAYS AND THE PRICE WAS GOOD AT 9499...
      
      SO 1ST IMPRESSION OF THE SET WAS IT LOOKS COOL AND IS SLEEK LOOKING...
      
      AFTER STARTING IT UP THE 1ST DAY I FACED SEVERAL PROBLEMS AS I WAS MOVING FROM THE ANDROID PLATFORM (XPERIA P)..
      
      THEY WERE:-
      
      NO VCF CONTACTS SUPPORT
      
      NO SUPPORT FOR CUSTOM NOTIFICATION TONES
      
      CANT GET PIRATED APPS HERE
      
      NO SWYPE KEYBOARD
      
      ETC...
      
      
      BUT AFTER FEW DAYS OF USE IT GREW ON ME NOW I DONT FIND ANYTHING THAT DIFFICULT TO OPERATE ANYMORE ITS FAST SMOOTH AND GOOD PERFORMANCE..
      
      THE GAMES AVAILABLE ARE FUN TOO...THOUGH APPS AND GAMES ARE NOT NUMEROUS LIKE ANDROID STILL A GOOD COLLECTION IS THERE...MUSIC IS GOOD... CAMERA SATISFIES ME...
      
      BUT THE BEST PART OF THE SET IS VIDEO PLAYBACK...IT PLAYS 1080P VIDEOS IN MP4 FORMAT WHICH EVEN MY P COUDNT PLAY...SO THATS REALLY GOOD...
      
      AND I AM IN LOVE WITH THE NOKIA MUSIC :)
      
      
      OTHER THAN THAT MY ONLY PROB WITH THE SET IS THE BATTERY LIFE..IT LASTS 1.5 DAYS ONLY(SIMILAR TO MY P)AND IT THOUGHT NOKIA PHONES AND WINDOWS LAST LONGER...BUT STILL ITS SOMETHING I CAN LIVE WITH....
      
      
      SO ALL IN ONE A GOOD PRODUVT AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED... JUST NEED A RED AND YELLOW BACK PANEL NOW TO GO WITH MY BLUE 1... CHEERS !!!"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"I GOT THIS PHONE 2 DAYS BACK. THE PHONE SEEMED PRETTY GUD HOWEVER IT TENDED TO SLIP DUE TO ITS UNTEXTURISED BACK COVER; ALSO WHEN WE GOT THE PHONE ITS CAMERA BUTTON WAS NOT WORKING WHICH WAS A SAD THING AND LASTED A BAD IMPRESSION OF FLIPKART ON ME  CONSIDERING THIS MY FIRST ORDER ON FLIPKART THOUGH THEY CHANGED THE PEICE .
      
      ANYWAYS THE PHONE IS A NICE ONE,EVERYTHING SEEMED OK ,MY ONLY CON WAS THE ABSENCE OF FLASH BUT THATS WHAT ONE GETS AT THAT PRICE PNT FROM A COMPANY LIKE NOKIA.
      
      EVERYTHING ON MOBILE WAS NICE FROM BROWSING TO MESSAGING ALSO SINCE I AM A ANDROID USER THE LACK OF APPS AT MARKETPLACE WAS A BIT IRRITATING FOR ME
      
      NEVERTHELESS I WILL LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT THIS IS A GUD PHONE AND ONE SHUD GO FOR IT IF THIS IS UR 1ST PHONE OR U WANT A CHANGE FROM ANDROID
      
      THNX"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"I HAV BOUGHT THIS PHONE ABT A WEEK BACK FRM NOKIA DEALERS. THESE ARE THE PROS AND CONS THAT I'VE FOUND.
      
      PROS:

      -WINDOWS 8 OS IS A JOY AFTER THE CONTINUOUS USE OF ANDROID.

      -NOKIA MUSIC , HERE MAPS AND NAVIGATION IS GREAT.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      -LOW BATTERY BACKUP. EVEN MINIMALIST USERS CANT LAST A FULLY DAY WITH A SINGLE CHARGE. NORMAL USE WITH INTERNET AND VIDEO PLAY BACK MEANS YOU ARE LOOKING AT 2 OR EVEN MORE FULL CHARGES.
      
      
      -NO FILE MANAGER.
      
      
      -THE DEVICE GETS HEATED UP DURING GAMING.
      
      
      -THE UI IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS ANDROID . NEW USERS MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT FOR SOMETIME.
      
      
      -THE WINDOWS APP STORE IS NOTHING COMPARED TO GOOGLE PLAY OR APPLE APP STORE.
      
      
      -VERY LESS CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS.
      
      
      -NO FRONT CAMERA OR FLASH"

      ITS A WASTE USING HANDS FREE WHILE DRIVING
      
      
      OVERALL ITS A GUD AND WORTH SMARTPHONE IN THE PRESENT MARKET

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"I ORDERED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART ON 28.06.2013 WHICH WAS DELIVERED ON 01.06.2013.
      
      THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON MY 25 DAYS OF ITS USAGE.
      
      
      THE FEATURES WHICH MAKES LUMIA 520 ATTRACTIVE ARE:
      
      
      1) ITS STYLISH DESIGN &AMP; IT FEELS GOOD IN HANDS.
      
      2) IT HAS GOOD BATTERY BACKUP (TALKTIME OF 14 HOURS (2G)).
      
      3) SENSITIVE &AMP; HIGHLY RESPONSIVE TOUCH.
      
      4) 4 INCH IPS DISPLAY WITH WVGA RESOLUTION &AMP; 16 M COLORS GIVES GOOD VIEWING EXPERIENCE.
      
      5) 5MP CAMERA WITH SMART SHOOT &AMP; PANORAMA LENSES GIVES BETTER PHOTO CAPTURING EXPERIENCE.
      
      6) 1GHZ DUAL CORE QUALCOMM KRAIT WITH 512MB RAM MAKES APPS WORKING WITOUT ANY LAG.
      
      7) HD VIDEOS ARE PLAYING VERY SMOOTHLY.
      
      
      I NOTICED FOLLOWING PROBLEMS DURING ITS USAGE,
      
      
      1) GETS LITTLE BIT HOTTER WHILE BROWSING &AMP; PLAYING GAMES.
      
      2) OUT OF 7.2GB(8GB) INTERNAL MEMORY, 2GB WILL BE CONSUMED BY WINDOWS OS &AMP; 300MB BY NECESSARY APPS. I.E ONLY 4.9GB IS USABLE.
      
      3) COMPARED TO ANROID PHONES LOWER APPS IN WP STORE &AMP; MOST OF THEM REQUIRES MONEY.
      
      4) THOUGH CLOUD STORAGE IS FREE, DATA PLANS ARE NOT.
      
      5) CANNOT VIEW ANY UNSUPPORTED FILES (NEED TO BE CLEARED FROM TEMP. FILES IN STOAGE CHECK).
      
      6) NO FRONT CAMERA AND LED FLASH AS PHONES IN SIMILAR PRICE RANGE (SAMSUNG S DUOS, MICROMAX CANVAS) HAVE THEM.
      
      
      IN MY OPINION IT IS WORTH FOR MONEY, MAKES U DISTINCT FROM ANROID PHONES. FORGET ITS NEGLIGIBLE PROBLEMS AND JUST GO FOR IT. THANK U ?"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER IN LAW, HE IS HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      WINDOWS 8 PLATFORM IS VERY STABLE AND I BELIEVE IF PEOPLE TRY THIS OUT, IT MAY BECOME A PHONE OS WHICH COULD DEFINATELY GIVE COMPETITION TO ANDROID OR IOS.
      
      
      NOKIA'S HARDWARE FOR THIS, ITS NOT BAD CONDISERING THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT. THE SCREEN TOUCH RESPONSE IS GOOD, WHICH I CANNOT SAY FOR THE LUMIA 720 I BOUGHT AND RETURNED BACK TO THE SELLER IN 3 DAYS.
      
      
      OVERALL, THE NOKIA LUMIA 520, IS A GOOD BUY, YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THE OPERATING SYSTEM."

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"I WANT TO BUY THIS PHONE BUT HAD SOME DOUBTS..
      
      THOSE WHO HAD BEEN USING THIS PHONE CAN YOU TELL ME THAT CAN WE MULTITASK WHATSAPP AND WECHAT ON THIS PHONE?
      
      CAN WE SIMULTANEOUSLY USE WHATSAPP AND WECHAT WITHOUT CLOSING ANY ONE OF THEM?
      
      AND IS INTERNET IS ALL TIME ""ON"" ON THIS PHONE? IF YES, CAN WE STOP IT?"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,I WOULDNT SAY THAT THE PHONE IS A FLAWLESS PIECE OF DEIGN.. I DONT KNOW IF THE PROBLEM IS JUS WID ME.. I HAVE BEEN USING THE PHONE OVER A COUPLE OF WEEKS.. THE PHONE IS QUITE SMOOTH WHILE USING AND HANDLES WELL... BUT DONT KNOW MAY BE ITS CUZ OF SUMMER/HIGHTEMPERATURES OR WAT.. TWISE OR THRICE IT HANGED SUDDENLY.. SCREEN GONE BLANK.. NO BUTTON RESPONDS.. I TOOK OFF THE BATTERY AND REPUT TO RESTART.. IF UR 2G INTERNET CONNECTION IS SLOW IT MAY EFFECT UR PHONE'S PERFORMANCE.. CUZ ALOT OF APPS RUN IN BACKGROUND AND U CANT STOP THEM... GAMING PERFORMANCE IS NORMALLY GOOD BUT MAY STUCK FOR A FEW SECONDS WHILE PLAYING.. ITS NOT A PERFECTLY WORKING PIECE ATLEAST MINE IS NOT... BUT I DONT INTEND TO CONTACT NOKIA FOR THIS ONLY MYTIME WILL BE WASTED... BUT OVERALL THE PHONE IS WORTH FOR THE PRICE..
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"IN THE WORLD CONTROLLED BY ANDROID ARMY....IT IS HARD FOR THE NOKIA BATTALION TO CAPTURE THE BUNKER....BUT NOKIA IS HITTING THEIR RIVALS WITH CHEAP PRICE TAGS AND COMPARATIVELY GOOD HARDWARE(@ THIS PRICE RANGE)....I'LL RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO EVERYONE WHO ARE ON A BUDGET RUN....BUT STILL THEY MISS OUT BASIC THINGS...LIKE MUSIC EQUALISER,SYSTEM-WIDE FILE MANAGER,FLASH SUPPORT IN THE BROWSER,APP CATALOG IS LIMITED(MAXIMUM APPS ARE USELESS)...MOREVER THE PHONE'S DUAL CORE KRAIT IS OF NOT MUCH USE AS IT HAS GOT NO SUCH APPS WHICH CAN USE THE PROCESSOR'S JUICE...RAM IS GOOD @ 512 FOR WP8 BUT IF ITS ANDROID THEN EVEN 768MB SEEMS LESS....ABOUT UI...YES THE UI IS FLUID AND FUN TO USE BUT ONE DAY OR THE OTHER U WILL BE BORED....UNLIKE IN ANDROID WHERE USERS CAN ROOT AND CHANGE THEIR PHONES EVERY ASPECT OF APPEARANCE(EVEN ANDROIDERS CAN MAKE THEIR PHONE LOOK LIKE WP8)....EVEN I FOUND ITS SUNLIGHT VISIBILITY LOW....PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A TRANSIT FROM ANDROID TO WP8 WILL SURELY MISS LIKES OF POWERAMP,CHROME,LAUNCHERS,EQUALISER APPS,NOTIFICATIONS,LOCKSCREEN SHORTCUTS AND MANY MORE......STILL ONE CAN BUY IT FOR REFRESHMENT OR WHO WANT A TRANSIT TO A NEW OS......WINDOWS HAS TO LURE DEVELOPERS INTO MAKING SEROUIS AND GOOD WP8 APS....NOKIA AND MICROSOFT WILL TAKE TIME BUT WILL WIN(SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE)...."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"ITS A WORTH BUY, BASED ON ITS PRICE, FEATURES AND DESIGN. THE MAIN THING ITS A BRAND NOKIA.
      
      IN THIS PRICE RANGE, YOU CAN'T GET A PERFECTLY SMOOTH ANDROID SMARTPHONE, SO THE LIGHT-ON-THE-HARDWARE WINDOWS PHONE 8 IS REALLY MADE TO COUNT. OF COURSE, THAT COMES AT THE PRICE OF SOMEWHAT MORE LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY BUT LITTLE OF IT SHOULD MATTER TO THOSE SHOPPING ON A BUDGET."

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"NOKIA IS BACK IN BUSINESS WITH LUMIA SERIES SMARTPHONES. LUMIA 520 IS THE STARTING MODEL IN NOKIA LUMIA SERIES. IT HAS A 1 GHZ QUALCOMM KRAIT DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND ADRENO 305 TO SUPPORT GRAPHICS. PHONE IS SUPPORTED WITH 512 MB RAM WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH TO RUN THE PHONE WITH OUT ANY HICCUPS. THE PHONE IS POWERED BY A 1430 MAH BATTERY WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE PHONE IN A WHOLE DAY OF MEDIUM USAGE. WINDOWS 8 RUNS BUTTERY SMOOTH IN THIS DEVICE WITHOUT ANY SLOWING DOWN OR HANGING UP.
      
      
      COMING TO THE PROCESSOR AND GPU, IT HAS A AVERAGE PROCESSING POWER WHICH CAN NOT SUPPORT A VERY HIGH GRAPHIC GAMES. GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN AND FRUIT NINJA RUNS VERY SMOOTH BUT WHEN U GO TO HIGHER GRAPHIC GAMES IT STARTS SHOWING LACK OF PROCESSING POWER. DISPLAY IS GOOD, THERE IS NO PIXELISATION.
      
      
      GPS IS VERY POWERFUL, IT LOCK IN LESS THAN 5 SEC IF YOU ARE UNDER A CLEAR SKY. APP STORE IS NOT VERY GREAT BUT STILL YOU WILL GET THE MINIMUM REQUIRED APPS FOR FREE.
      
      
      BROWSING IS FAST AND DRAINS THE BATTERY EASY. 1430 MAH BATTERY DRAINS OUT EASILY ONCE YOU START BROWSING ON YOUR MOBILE FOR A WHILE. IF YOU CONSTRAIN YOURSELF FROM BROWSING ON GPRS YOU WILL GET A BATTERY LIFE OF A WHOLE DAY.
      
      
      VIDEO PLAYBACK AND THE AUDIO QUALITY IS GOOD. NOKIA MUSIC SUBSCRIPTION FOR 3 MONTHS IS FREE WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      
      THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN SYNCHRONIZING GMAIL ON THIS PHONE. GMAPS APP CAN BE INSTALLED IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE NOKIA MAP.
      
      
      ONLY DRAWBACK I FOUND IN THIS PHONE IS THE UNAVAILABILITY OF A SECONDARY CAMERA AND MAGNETIC SENSOR.
      
      
      WITH THE WINDOWS 8.1 UPDATE, LUMIA 520 WILL BE HAVING A RADIO (ITS ALREADY INTEGRATED IN THE CHIP BUT NOT SUPPORTED BY SOFTWARE IN WINDOWS 8.0)"

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"THE PHONE IS BEST IN ITZ ZONE. IF U GO FOR THE COMPARISIONS ANY PHONE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE ITS PROS AND CONS. BUT IF ONE IS LOOKING FOR GOOD QUALITY WITH DECENT FEATURES THEN THIS PHONE MEETS IT. PROS WOULD BE THAT GOOD TOUCH,BUILD, SCREEN, LAYOUT, SOUND THATS EXTREMELY CLEAR WHEN ITZ LOUD, GOOD CALL QUALITY. CONS IS THAT FILE TRANSFERS HAVE GOT COMPLAINS AS WITH WINDOWS PHONE SECURITY IS A BIG CONCERN AND PIRATED STUFFS DONT USUALLY BE PLAYED AS FOR VIDEOS ESPECIALLY. SO IF U A BIG TIME MOVIE DOWNLOADER THEN I THINK IT'LL B A LET DOWN AS MOST OF THEM DONT PLAY AS FOR SECURITY REASONS. BUT SOME DO PLAY SO LOT OF WORK ON TAT TO B DONE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH PLAYS AND WHICH DONT. A HECTIC PROCESS OF CONNECTING IT TO SYSTEM IN CASE U WANT TO CHANGE UR RINGTONE TO AN MP3 TAT U HAV IS UNNECESSARY PROCESS, SHOULD HAV AN OPTION OF DIRECTLY PUTTIN AN MP3 AS TONE. GAMES DO PLAY FINE AND DECENT BATTERY TO SAY. SO IF ONE IS LOOKING FOR A EYECANDY PHONE FOR BASIC GAMING AND CALLS AND MESSAGING AND LISTENING TO SONGS THEN THIS ONE IS THE BEST."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"THE PHONE IS REALLY VALUE FOR MONEY WITH THE VARIETY OF FEATURES IT PROVIDES.

Nokia Lumia 520,4,THE PHONE WORKS GREAT WITHOUT ANY LAG. IT TAKES SOMETIME THOUGH TO INITIALLY START THE PHONE FOR THE 1ST TIME. THE NOKIA MAPS ARE A BIG ASSERT IF YOU ARE ON THE MOVE ALWAYS TO UNKNOWN PLACES. AUDIO IS LOUD &AMP; CLEAR. VIDEO PLAYS SMOOTHLY. CAMERA WORKS GREAT &AMP; CAPTURE FINE DETAILS BUT IN NIGHT IT IS NOT THAT GREAT. THE MAJOR CON IS LACK OF FLASH &AMP; SMART DAIL. OTHER THAN THAT EVERYTHING IS NICE. ALSO THE APPS IN WINDOWS STORE ARE INCREASING BUT NOT AS MUCH AS YOU FINE IN APPLE &AMP; ANDROID STORES. BUT THE WINDOWS STORE HAS A GREAT FEATURE OF TRY FOR ALMOST EVERY APP SO THE YOU CAN TRY THE GAME OR ANY OTHER APP &AMP; THEN IF YOU LIKE IT THEN YOU CAN BUY IT. LASTLY EXCELLENT FAST DELIVERY BY FLIPKART. THANKS TO YOU FLIPKART PEOPLE.
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"THIS PHONE IS GOOD BUY FOR RS.8500-9500. THOUGH I HAVE BEEN USING ANDROID FROM LAST 2 YEARS, WANTED TO TRY THIS WINDOWS PHONE. BUT NOW PRICE HAS CHANGED IN FLIPKART. SO IT IS UPTO USERS TO PAY EITHER RS.9800 OR WAIT OR BUY OUTSIDE!"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"THIS PHONE IS JUST BANG FOR THE BUCK . I GOT THE DELIVERY IN 2 DAYS . AS USUAL , FLIPKART KEEPS UP WITH ITS EXPRESS DELIVERY SERIVICES . I BOUGHT THE PHONE AT 9444 . TOUCH RESPONSE IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE , BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY VERY GOOD , WITH 3 HRS OF MUSIC AND ONE HR OF DOWNLOADING AND WITH WIFI ALWAYS ON , IT LASTS ME NEARLY 2 DAYS . ONE DOWNSIDE ABOUT THE PHONE IS THE CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT IMPRESSIVE FOR A 5MP SHOOTER . ITS JUST DECENT , BUT THEN AGAIN , U CANT EXPECT EVERYTHING AT THIS PRICE POINT . THE PHONE DOES NOT LAG AT ALL , AND THE APP MARKET IS EXPANDING DAY BY SAY . ONE MORE ANNOYING FEATURER IS THAT , THE APPS ON THE MARKET ARE NEW ,SO THERE ARE QUITE A FEW BUGS , DUE TO THIS , THERE IS AROUND 30 MB DOWNLOADS EVERY OTHER DAY , AS UPDATES .
      
      ALL IN ALL , I WOULD SAY THAT THIS PHONE IS A STEAL AT THIS PRICE .

Nokia Lumia 520,4,"WANT A FULLY LOADED PHONE, BUT CANNOT AFFORD IT? NO WORRIES. THE NOKIA LUMIA 520 IS YOUR DREAM COME-TRUE. WITH LOVELY FEATURES ONLY AVAILABLE IN HIGH-END SMARTPHONES AND DAZZLING LOOKS, MY NOKIA LUMIA 520 IS ALSO A SUPREME PERFORMER WITH GREAT SPEED AND BATTERY LIFE.
      
      
      ITS 1 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR AND 512 MB RAM REDEFINES SPEED FOR THIS RANGE OF SMARTPHONES. FOR GAME LOVERS LIKE ME, THIS IS THE PHONE TO HAVE. ITS 800 X 480 CLEAR QUALITY DISPLAY AND ALLOWS ME TO ENJOY UNENDING ENTERTAINMENT ON THE GO. I JUST LOVE THE LIVE TILES ON THE HOME PAGE WHICH ARE VERY CONVENIENT FOR ACCESS AS WELL AS TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS. I HAVE SET THEM ACCORDING TO MY NEEDS.
      
      
      AT JUST 124G, MY NOKIA LUMIA 520 IS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND SLIM. IT COMES IN 5 DIFFERENT COLOURS, AND I CHOSE MINE IN HOT RED. MY DAZZLING RED LUMIA 520 WITH A SLIGHT CURVE AT BOTTOM ATTRACTS EVERYONE AROUND ME. QUITE COOL, RIGHT! I AM A MUSIC DEVOTEE AND THE NOKIA MIX RADIO HAS BECOME MY TEMPLE. BE IT ONLINE OR OFFLINE, I LISTEN TO MY FAVOURITE TUNES WHENEVER I WANT. MY PHONE SPORTS SPEAKERS AT THE REAR BOTTOM END AND VOLUME KEYS AT RIGHT, WHICH ARE EASY TO ACCESS.
      
      
      I ALWAYS HAVE MY PHONE MEMORY FULL OF LARGE PLAYLISTS, MANY PHOTO ALBUMS AND WORK-RELATED FILES. MY LUMIA 520 COMES WITH 8 GB PHONE MEMORY WHICH IS EXPANDABLE TO 64 GB USING A MICROSD CARD. NOW I AM FREE OF ?MEMORY-FULL? PROBLEMS. ALSO THE 7 GB CLOUD STORAGE ON SKYDRIVE HELPS ME STORE AND ACCESS MY STUFF ON THE CLOUD FROM WHEREVER I AM.
      
      
      ACCORDING TO ME, A GOOD PHONE IS ONE THAT CAN CAPTURE AMAZING PICTURES. WITH A 5 MP CAMERA, MY LUMIA 520 IS QUITE CAPABLE OF THIS. THE QUALITY OF SNAPS IS CLASSY. THE INTEGRATED SMART SHOOT IS THE BEST PHOTO TOOL EVER. I CAN TAKE MULTIPLE PICTURES IN A SINGLE CLICK AND THEN EDIT THEM. WITH CINEMAGRAPH I CAN MAKE THE ANIMATE STILL IMAGES. WIDE-ANGLED PHOTOS ADD BEAUTY TO MY MEMORIES. CREDITS TO THE PANORAMA FEATURE ON MY PHONE! MY LUMIA 520 ALSO HAS GREAT 720P VIDEO RECORDING CAPABILITIES. NOW, I DON?T HAVE TO MISS ANY ACTIVITY WORTH REMEMBERING.
      
      
      WINDOWS 8 NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION. WITH IT COME MS OFFICE SUPPORT, NOKIA HERE LOCATION APP AND NOKIA MIX RADIO. MS OFFICE SUPPORT IS THE BEST FEATURE FOR BUSY BEES LIKE ME TO WORK WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO MY PC EVERY TIME. THE SUPER-SENSITIVE TOUCH SCREEN IS A RELIEF FROM FRUSTRATING TOUCH SCREENS THAT WOULD NOT BUDGE EVEN AFTER LOADS OF CLICKS. ALSO, I CAN NOW OPERATE IT WITHOUT TAKING MY GLOVES OFF IN THE FRIGID WEATHER.
      
      
      THE HERE LOCATION APP ON MY LUMIA 520 IS A GENIE FOR TRAVELLING LOVERS AND WANDERERS LIKE ME. IT IS EXTREMELY SPECIFIC WITH ITS DIRECTIONS. I JUST NEED TO PACK MY BAG AND OFF I GO! I RECOMMEND THE NOKIA LUMIA 520. I TOTALLY LOVE IT."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"WE GOT A DISCOUNT FROM FLIPKART AND WE GOT THE PHONE FOR  8650/-. A VERY GOOD PHONE AT A GOOD PRICE.FAR BETTER THAN THE SAMSUNG'S, HTC'S, SONY IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS PROMPT AS USUAL"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"WELL WHEN I FIRST OPENED THE BOX...WOW..THERE GOES IT THE SHINY NEW LUMIA 520...
      
      PROS:
      
      ITS CHEAP COMPARED TO OTHER ""BRANDED"" SMARTPHONES IN THE MARKET.
      
      GREAT BUILT QUALITY, FEELS SOLID IN HAND AND LOOKS GREAT.
      
      SMOOTH BUT RARELY SOMETIMES IT LAGS(IT DOES NOT BECOME MUCH OF A PROBLEM THOUGH).
      
      GOOD MULTITASKING
      
      LOUDSPEAKERS ARE LOUD ENOUGH BUT SOUND QUALITY GETS A LITTLE DOWNGRADED AT HIGH VOLUMES...IF YOU PREFER QUALITY OVER LOUDNESS THEN U BETTER LISTEN AT 20(IN THE SCALE OF 30).
      
      COLOURFUL AND UNIQUE INTERFACE FOR WHO ARE BORED WITH ANDROID INTERFACE. THE LOCKSCREEN REALLY LOOKS GOOD.
      
      SIMPLE TO USE.
      
      CAN PLAY 1080P VIDEOS WITH EASY BUT IN SUCH HIGH QUALITY VIDEOS NAVIGATING BECOMES HELL.
      
      GOOD CAMERA(IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR HAND STEADY ENOUGH AND HAVE ENOUGH LIGHT AROUND BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COME WITH A FLASH).
      
      CHARGING IS FAST AND IT KEEPS UP FOR LONG PROVIDED YOU ARE NOT A HEAVY GAMER.
      
      THERES A GOOD GAME THATS AVAILIABLE FOR FREE..THATS ""DREDD VS ZOMBIES"" IT WILL KEEP U BUSY FOR SOMETIME.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      THE SCREEN IS SHINY BUT IT ATTRACTS FINGERPRINTS(A TISSUE PAPER WIPE NOW AND THEN WILL DO GOOD ALSO ADVISED TO GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR)
      
      THE SCREEN IS REFLECTIVE AND UNDER SUN ITS DIFFICULT TO USE.
      
      NO FM
      
      THE OS STILL REQUIRES DEVELOPMENT(EG. YOU CANNOT TRANSFER VIDEO FILES VIA BLUETOOTH, MUSIC AND PICTURES CAN STILL BE TRANSFERRED).
      
      THE HANDSET DOESN'T COME WITH A GOOD PAIR OF HEADPHONES.. BETTER IF YOU BUY ONE.
      
      IT REQUIRES MICRO SIM.
      
      LACKS APPS IN THE APP STORE AND MOST OF THE GOOD APPS ARE PAID(THE ORIGINAL ANGRY BIRDS GAME COSTS RS 55).IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TEMPLE RUN 2 AND TALKING TOM 2.
      
      THERE IS NO FILE MANAGER.
      
      LESS CHANCE OF CUSTOMIZATION(YOU CAN'T SET A WALLPAPER)
      
      THERE IS NO AUDIO ENHANCEMENT AND THE AUDIO PLAYER LACKS EQUALIZER.
      
      TAKES A LONG TIME TO START(EXPECTED SINCE ITS A SMARTPHONE).
      
      YOU HAVE TO OPEN THE BATTERY EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE SIM OR MEMORY CARD AND THUS YOU HAVE TO ADJUST THE TIME EVERY TIME YOU DO SO.
      
      
      BUT AT THIS PRICE YOU SIMPLY CANNOT EXPECT MORE AND THIS IS INDEED A STEAL AT THIS PRICE POINT. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THE ANDROID PHONES YOU SEE WHEN YOU TRAVEL IN THE BUS. THIS IS THE WAY TO GO..IT SEEMS AS IF WINDOWS PHONES HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE."
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"WELL, ALMOST EVERYTHING HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND NOTHING NEW LEFT TO BE SAID BUT I WOULD SAY ITS A GREAT BUY, AWESOME TOUCH AND WELL BUILD UP AS IT FITS PERFECTLY IN MY HAND AS I'M NOT A FAN OF PHONES WITH GIANT SCREENS WHICH ONE CAN'T USE WITH ONE HAND...
      
      
      BOUGHT IT FROM LOCAL MARKET AS IT WAS CHEAP AT 9500.. BUT APPS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT ONE WILL MISS IN THIS PHONE.. I'M SURE DEVELOPERS MAY BE WORKING HARD TO MAKE AVAILABLE THEIR APPS ON WINDOWS PLATFORM BUT NOTHING CAN BE SAID RIGHT NOW..
      
      
      A MUST BUY BUDGET PHONE..
      
      
      BEGGINING OF A NEW LOVE AFFAIR WITH THIS LUMIA 520"
Nokia Lumia 520,4,"WORTH FOR THE MONEY, WINDOWS OS IS GOOD, NOT MUCH LAG AND USER FRIENDLY TOO. SOME BASIC OPTIONS ARE MISSING IN 520 LIKE ANY AUDIO SETTING. BATTERY BACKUP 24-30HRS WITH MODERATE USAGE. IF YOUR HAVE BUDGET 720 IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CONSIDERING IT HAS EVERYTHING WHICH 520 HAS PLUS SOME ADDITIONAL OPTIONS/SETTINGS, VERY GOOD DESIGN, LIGHT WEIGHT, EASY TO HOLD DESIGN, EXCELLENT CAMERA AND A REALLY POWERFUL BATTERY."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"1. SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENT SETTING FOR MUSIC AND CALLING. WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING GAME YOU GENERALLY SLOW DOWN  VOLUME.SOMETIMES WHEN YOU FORGET TO INCREASE THE VOLUME YOU WONT HEAR THE PHONE RING WHEN SOME ONE CALL YOU.
      
      
      2. THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR MULTIPLE PLAYLISTS IN MUSIC PLAYER
      
      
      3. SHOULD HAVE MORE FREE GAMES AND APPS"
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"A PERSON SHOULD PRE-BOOK HIS LUMIA ONLY IF HE ENJOYS GETTING ""FRUSTRATED "" ""ANNOYED"" AND FINDS ITS ""THRILLING"" IN CALLING UP THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ON A DAY 2 DAY BASIS TO GET THE SAME KIND OF ANSWERS...
      
      AND YES THIS CONTINUES TILL THE NEXT MODEL IS UP ON A PRE-BOOKING MODE."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"AFTER AN EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON PHONES (WHAT TO BUY?), I BOUGHT THIS (NOT THRU FLIPKART..SORRY FLIPKART I LIKE YOUR SERVICE BUT I GOT A BETTER DEAL). I HAD A NEGATIVE THOUGHT ABOUT THE TOUCH SCREEN AFTER SEEING SEVERAL NOKIA PHONES BUT THIS NOKIA PHONE HAS A VERY SENSITIVE TOUCH...ITS COOL. THE LOOK IS VERY NICE...AFFORDABLE....ITS JUST 4 DAYS SO I AM NOT REALLY AWARE OF THE USAGE OF THE SPECS...BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS BETTER...IT SHOWS THE APPROX TIME OF BATTERY LEVELS. THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS ALSO...THE CAMERA IS ALSO FINE."

Nokia Lumia 520,3,"FRIENDS AM THE USER OF LUMIA 520 FOR A MONTH. FOUND SOME ISSUES WHICH MADE MY PERCEPTION ABOUT THE WINDOWS PHONE COMPLETELY WRONG.
      
      EVERYONE OF US LIKES TO BE DIFFERENT. THIS MADE ME TO BUY THIS PHONE RATHER THAN MOVING INTO ANDROID MARKET (ALREADY USED XPERIA U).THIS PHONE DOESNT STAND TO ITS NAME ""INNOVATIVE SMART PHONE"".
      
      COULD YOU IMAGINE A DUALCORE SMARTPHONE WITHOUT AN BUILT-IN EQUILIZER. THIS IS IT.
      
      FRIENDS,YOU KNOW WHAT?? I COULDNT SEARCH IN GOOGLE AS  A SEARCH ENGINE USING UC BROWSER. INITIALLY THE PHONE IS SMOOTH AS BUTTER. BUT AFTER TIMES ITS SHOWING SOME LAG WHICH IS DISGUSTING.
      
      THESE MAY BE MINOR ISSUES,BUT THIS MADE ME DISAPPOINTING AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE.
      
      
      THINK WILL GET SOME MORE ISSUES IN FUTURE.
      
      ONE THING I HAD UNDERSTOOD IS REALLY WINDOWS NEED TO RESOLVE LOTS OF BUGS AND FROM NOKIA SIDE REGRETTING FOR CHOOSING A SMARTPHONE WITHOUT EQUILIZER.
      
      
      GAVE THIS THREE STARS ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS USER INTERFACE AND SOME GOOD FEATURES LIKE SOME FRIENDS MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS REVIEWS.
      
      
      THINK BEFORE YOU BUY.BETTER MUSIC LOVERS DONT EVER THINK OF BUYING THIS."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,GUYS BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2 DAYS AGO...IM EXPERIENCING A MINOR PROBLEM. WHILE SPEAKING ON THE  THE PHONE DURING CALLS IT VIBRATES AT THE BACK PANEL AREA .I TRIED TO REDUCE THE SPEAKER VOLUME EVEN THEN THE PROBLEM EXISTS.. .IS IT BECAUSE OF THE SLIM NATURE OF THE PHONE OR IS IT REALLY SOME OTHER PROBLEM WHICH NEEDS ATTENTION...HAV ANYONE OF U EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM..OR SHUD I TAKE IT TO THE SERVICE CENTRE...PLS HELP...
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"HI ALL.......   I BOUGHT IT AROUND 3 WEEKS AGO. NO DOUBT IT IS A GOOD PHONE. BUT CERTAIN THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO CLEAR FOR THOSE WHO ARE PLANNING TO GO FOR IT. AND THESE ARE THE TRUTHS WHICH U ALL HAVE TO CONSIDER IN YOUR MIND.
      
      
      A)  NO FM (U ALL WILL BE AWARE OF IT)
      
      
      B)  NO FLASH AND SECONDARY CAMERA(EVEN U CAN GO FOR SKYPE CALLING BUT U HAVE TO USE THE MOBILE FROM BACK SIDE BCOZ IT DON'T HAVE SECONDARY CAMERA FOR VIDEO CALLING)
      
      
      C)  FRONT CAMERA IS 5 MEGAPIXEL. (PICTURE QUALITY IS GOOD BUT ONLY DURING DAYLIGHT.....HARD TO RECOGNIZE THE SNAPS SHOOT DURING EVENING OR NIGHT TIME)
      
      
      D)  MOST IMPORTANT : U CANT SEND THE VIDEOS STORED IN MEMORY OR PHONE TO OTHER PERSONS USING WHATSAPP. AS U ALL KNOW WHATSAPP IS QUITE FAMOUS NOWADAYS, BUT LUMIA 520 IS UNABLE TO FORWARD THEM THROUGH WHATSAPP. ONLY U CAN SEND THE VIDEOS RECORDED DURING THAT MOMENT.
      
      
      E)   APPLICATION WISE THERE IS NO ISSUE. AS ITS A MYTH THAT MOST PEOPLE USUALLY SAYS THAT ANDROID IS MORE RICH COMPARED TO WINDOWS PHONE. ACTUALLY IN ROUTINE WEARE SUPPOSED TO USE ONLY ABOUT 25 TO 30 APPLICATIONS, WHICH U CAN EASILY FIND IN WINDOWS STORE.
      
      
      OVERALL SPEED OF THE PHONE IS PRETTY GOOD..NO HANGING PROBLEM. LITTLE HEATING PROBLEM IS THERE..........."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"HI GUYS.
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR COUPLE OF WEEKS NOW. IT TOOK ME RIGOROUS INTERNET SEARCHING ON HOW TO USE THIS PHONE. NOW I M VERY HANDY WITH IT AND USE TO THIS TECHNOLOGY WP8.
      
      FOUND FEW THINGS MISSING IN THE PHONE.
      
      THERE IS NO EQUALIZER FOR MUSIC PLAYER.
      
      THERE IS NO FILE MANAGER. THERE IS NO RAM BOOSTER OR TASK KILLER AS IN ANDROID. AT-LEAST I HAVEN'T SEEN YET.
      
      THIS PHONE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS XP OS. ONLY WINDOWS 7, VISTA AND LATEST WINDOWS OS.
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS DISGUSTING. WITH HEAVY USAGE U NEED TO CHARGE THE BATTERY TWICE A DAY THOUGH BATTERY CHARGES INSTANTLY.
      
      YOU NEED TO CONNECT THE PHONE TO THE PC TO TRANSFER UR PERSONNEL DOWNLOADED RINGTONES IN THE PHONE RINGTONE FOLDER. THROUGH SD CARD U CANNOT ASSIGN RINGTONE.
      
      THERE IS NO AFTER CALL SUMMARY OR OPTION TO VIEW CALL DURATION.
      
      
      BUT STILL THERE ARE LOT MORE THINGS IN THIS PHONE WHICH MAKES IT GOOD
      
      ANDROID IS MUCH BETTER OPTION."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"HI,
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART 2 DAYS BACK AND FACING AN ISSUE ALREADY WITH ITS WIFI. THOUGH I AM CONNECTED THROUGH WEP BUT
      
      1. IT KEEP GETTING DISCONNECTED &AMP; CONNECTED . NO IDEA WHY THE HELL IT'S HAPPENING BUT ITS QUITE IRRITATING.
      
      2. IF SOMEHOW YOU HAVE TO SWITCH OFF &AMP; ON YOUR PHONE; YOU HAVE TO KEY IN YOUR WIFI KEY ONCE AGAIN IT SEEMS THAT PHONE DOESN'T SAVE WIFI PROFILES FOR FUTURE USE.
      
      3. I HAVE TO KEY IN WIFI KEY EVERY TIME I REACH HOME AND OFFICE.
      
      4. I TRIED EVERY IDEA TO MAKE IT SORTED BUT ALL IN VAIN. THESE KIND OF MEDIOCRE ISSUES WERE NOT EXPECTED FROM NOKIA.
      
      
      GOD HELPS."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"I AM PERSONALLY DISAPPOINTED HAVING USED NOKIA FOR QUITE A LONG TIME HAD E71, NOKIA ASHA 302 AND E 63 AND TO MY SURPRISE THIS ISN'T AS GOOD AS IT IS SAID BY MAJORITY. TO FIGURE A FEW FLAWS-
      
      1. PROBLEMS MANAGING FILES- NO FILE MANAGER PROVIDED ONE IS THERE WHICH CHARGES YOU 1$ AND PROVIDES ONLY PHONE MEMORY SUPPORT.
      
      2. THERE ARE NO.OF APPLICATIONS WHICH NEEDS TO BE UPDATED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE WITH SYMBIAN OS. WHATSAPP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE, NEEDS AN UPDATE IMMEDIATELY WITH ITS EVER HANGING PROBLEM.
      
      3. I GENUINELY RESPECT THE POLICY OF MICROSOFT  TO KILL PIRACY BUT BEING IN A MARKET WHERE ALMOST EVERY OTHER PERSON IS USING MICROSOFT'S RIVAL OS WE TEND TO COMPARE ITS EASE OF USE WITH WP.
      
      4. LACK OF PROPER BROWSER (OPERA MINI IS NOT SUPPORTED AND REST ALL BROWSERS ARE BUGGY)/ FACEBOOK APP IS WAY TOO BUGGY.
      
      
      FEW GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE OS.-
      
      1. TOUCH RESPONSE IS EXCEPTIONAL.
      
      2. USER INTERFACE IS GOOD TOO.
      
      3. NICE PHOTO APPS AND CAMERA QUALITY IS PHENOMENAL DESPITE NO FLASH.
      
      4. MAPS BY NOKIA.
      
      
      CONCLUSIONS - IF YOU ARE NOT INTO APPS AND WANT ONLY HANDSET WITH GOOD CAMERA AND BUILD QUALITY THEN GO FOR IT.
      
      WITHIN 10K YOU CANT GET THE BETTER CAMERA QUALITY THAN THIS.
      
      I WOULD GIVE IT A RATING OF 3 ON 5."

Nokia Lumia 520,3,I HAD ORDERED A NOKIA 520 ON 16TH JULY 2013 FOR DELIVERY AT COCHIN. THEY HAD PROMISED A DELIVERY IN 2 TO 3 DAYS. THE DELIVERY IS STILL PENDING AS ON 22 ND  AND NO CONFIRMED DATE YET HAS BEEN SAID. NOW I AM SPENDING MY TIME CALLING THE COURIER AND CONTACT CENTRES  AS THEY SAY THE MOBILE IS LYING AT THE COCHIN HUB FROM 18TH ONWARDS.
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"I ORDER NOKIA LUMIA 520 FROM FLIPKART FOR MY WIFE ON 20TH APRIL 2013.RS 10,499.AND VERY NEXT 3 DAY PRICE DOWN TO 9,999 (LOSS OF 500)USING NOKIA FROM MY COLLEAGE DAYS NOKIA IS POPULAR FOR THERE SIMPLE AND USER FRIEDLLY APPS.BUT NOT NOW NOWSDYA DON'T KNOW WHY NOKIA FAIL TO KEEP THERE STANDARD.
      
      
      ABOUT THIS PARTICULA PHONE NOKIA LUMIA 520 VALUE FOR MONEY ONLY DEFECT IN CAMERA PANAL FOR THAT I NEED TO VIST NOKIA CUSTOMER CARE AND SPEND AROUND 3 TO 4 HR.WASTE OF TIME NOKIA SAID WILL GIVE YOU CHANGE CAMERA PANAL FREE OF COST BUT CURREENTLY WE DONT HAVE NEED TO WAIT 4-5 DAYS MORE. I CALL FLIPKART TO REPLACE THIS MOBILE HOPFULLY THIS TIME I GET ONE HAS NO ISSUE."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"IN THIS PHONE CAN V DOWNLOAD SONGS FROM WEBSITES SUCH AS MP3RAID , SONGSPK ETC . AND HOW SOON DOES THE PHONE GETS HEATED AND HOW MUCH HEAT DOES IT GENERATE . SHALL I BUY THIS PHONE OR CANVAS 2
      
      
      ....."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"IT IS AMAZING AS IT IS FEATURE RICH FOR WHAT IT COSTS. BUT THEN THERE ARE CONSISTENT CALL DROPS, WHICH IS QUITE ANNOYING. ALSO FOR SOME ONE MOVING FROM ANDROID THIS WILL BE MORE TEXTUAL THAN ICON BASED, SO IT MIGHT BE QUITE SOME SHIFT. ALSO CERTAIN INTUITIVE FEATURES ARE IGNORED LIKE, I CANNOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN INCOMING/OUTGOING CALLS UNLESS I READ THE STRINGS (RATHER IT IS EXPECTED TO BE KNOWN QUICKLY THROUGH COLOR OR SOME OTHER SIMPLER MECHANISM). I GUESS IT IS USABLE BUT IS MORE OF WAIT AND WATCH ABOUT HOW SOON NOKIA FIXES THE ISSUES. BUT IN GENERAL I GUESS IT IS RATHER NAIVE TO EXPECT THIS ONE TO BE PICKED UP BY MASSES AS THERE ARE SERIOUS USABILITY ISSUES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT NOKIA/MICROSOFT ARE BETTING ON, IF ITS ONLY COST THEN ITS JUST MATTER OF TIME THESE WILL BE THROWN OUT FOR EXCHANGE."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"KEEP READY YOUR MICRO SIM BEFORE BUYING IT.
      
      MY PHONE CAMERA BUTTON IS NOT WORKING.NO FRONT CAMERA AND MOBILE LOOKS ARE VERY ORDINARY.
      
      I DON'T LIKE THE HEADPHONE AT ALL, IT LOOKS VERY CHEAP.
      
      
      SO BE CAREFUL WHILE ORDERING."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"LATE DELIVERY BY 4 DAYS. THOUGH THE PRODUCT WAS LYING IN LOCAL COURIER OFFICE, NO ONE BOTHERED TO DELIVER. EVEN AFTER REPEATED CALLS, NO USE. SUPPORT CENTER IS VERY POLITE BUT THEY DONT TAKE NECESSARY STEPS FAST TO RESOLVE ISSUE - IN SHORT, USELESS.
      
      
      PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR THE BUDGET. NO OTHER PHONE IN THIS RANGE CAN BEAT IT. THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS, BUT WE CAN'T EXPECT EVERYTHING FOR 10K, CAN WE?"
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"MOST REVIEWS ON THIS PHONE BY USERS ARE IMMEDIETELY AFTER GETTING THE PHONE. THWESE REVIEWS ARE NOT GOOD FEEDBACK AND ARE MISLEADING. I'VE USED THE LUMIA 520 FOR GOOD 2 MONTHS NOW AND YES I DO REGRET BUYING IT. INITIALLY FOR THE PRICE POINT THE PHONE IS VERY TEMPTING. ALSO THE SPEC, LOOKS AND FEEL OF THE PHONE ARE VERY WORTH. HAVING SAID THIS, ITS THE USABILITY OF THE PHONE THAT MATTERS. NO POINT OF HAVING ALL THE SPEC AND NOT BE ABLE TO USE IT.
      
      HERE ARE THE CONS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF THERE DISCOVERY BY ME:
      
      1. NO FM RADIO...!!!
      
      I LISTEN TO FM RADIO EVERYDAY ON MY COMMUTE TO OFFICE BY BUS. THIS IS MAJOR
      
      DISAPPOINTMENT FOR RADIO LOVERS. ALTHOUGH NOKIA/MS HAS PROMISED TO FIX THIS WITH AN
      
      SOFTWARE UPDATE. UNTILL THEN THIS REMAINS A CON.
      
      2. COULDN'T CONNECT TO WIFI IN MY OFFICE.
      
      A LITTLE SEARCH O THE WEB SHOWED THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROB. QUITE A FEW
      
      PEOPLE ALL OVER THE GLOBE ARE FACING SIMILAR PROBLEM. ALTHOUGH I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT TO
      
      THE WIFI IN MY HOME. THIS IS A MOJAR ISSUE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANNA USE NET USING THE
      
      WIFI AND NOT USE THE DATA PACK FOR INTERNET.
      
      3. CANNOT SET A SONG FROM THE MUSIC LIBRARY AS MY RINGTONE(JUST WITH THE PHONE).
      
      THIS REQUIRES U TO CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO A WINDOWS MACHINE AND TRANSFER SONG FROM
      
      PC TO PHONE'S RINGTONES FOLDER. C'MON... SERIOUSLY WHO WANTS TO WASTE TIME FOR THIS
      
      SMALL BUT CHARACTERISTIC THING. C'MON MS U CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS.
      
      4. CANNOT TRANSFER A SONG FROM WINDOWS PHONE TO ANOTHER PHONE USING BLUETOOTH.
      
      THIS IS CRAZY MAN.. I CANT SHARE MY MUSIC WITH MY FRNDS.. WTF IS MS DOING. I CAN
      
      RECEIVE SONGS AND VIDEOS, BUT CANT SEND VIA BLUETOOTH. I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH PICS
      
      THOUGH.
      
      5. NO SEPERATE VOLUME SETTINGS FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES.
      
      THIS IS MAJOR FOLKS. I'M LISTENING TO MUSIC AND I DECREASE VOLUME OF THE MUSIC, THE
      
      RINGTONE VOLUME ALSO DECREASES..!! THTS TRUE.. U HEARD IT RIGHT. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY
      
      SCENARIO. THERE ARE NO SEPERATE VOLUME SETTINGS FOR RINGTONE MUSIC, KEYPAD TONE, MSG
      
      TONE, GAMES, APPS ETC.. MS PLS PLS FIX THIS ASAP IF YOU WISH TO STAY IN THE SMARTPHONE
      
      MARKET.
      
      6. INEFFICIENT NOKIA MAPS AND HERE DRIVE.
      
      I HAVE USED THIS APP FOR 2 DAYS AND WAS NOT SATISFIED. THE MAP ALWAYS SHOWED LONGER
      
      ROUTE AND KEPT ON SEARCHING FOR DIRECTIONS AT EVERY TURN.
      
      7. LAST AND THE MOST TALKED ABOUT - THE APPS AND THE STORE.
      
      YES WINDOWSPHONE8 NEW. YES WINDOWS ARE COMING UP WITH THE APPS. YES WINDOWS STORE HAS MORE THAN 3,00,000 APPS. BUT STILL A NO TO WINDOWSPHONE. WHO CARES THEY ARE COMING UP OR THEY WILL COME UP WITH GOOD APPS. PEOPLE WANT THE APPS NOW AND USE THEM NOW, NOT WHEN IPHONE, AND ANDROID USERS HAVE GOT TIRED OF THOSE APPS. ANGRY BIRDS, TEMPLE RUN GAMES ARE STILL NOT FREE INTHE APP STORE..!! MANY POPULAR GAMING TITLES ARE PAID. WHO WANTS TO PAY WHEN UR ANDRIOD FRNDS GET IT FOR FREE AND SOONER THAN WINDOWS USER. FACEBOOK AAP IS GOOD, THE UI IS GOOD, BUT CANT SEE THE FRNDS WHO R ONLINE. YOUTUBE APP IS A TRIAL VERSION ONE. MY WHATSAPP APP FROZE TWICE AND I HAD TO RE-INSTALL IT. MS U BETTER GET UR ACT RIGHT FAST B4 U GET UR ASS WHIPPED.
      
      
      NOW LETS COME TO THE PROS OF THE NOIKA WINDOWS 8 DEVICE:
      
      1. THE INTERFACE IS FRESH AND YOUNG AND APPEALING AND EYE-CATCHY. THE LIVE TILES ARE AMAZING. THE UI IS SMOOTH. TRAVERSING THROUGH THE APPS IS SMOOTH AND FLUID.
      
      2. FOR 5MP CAMERA, ITS REALLY GOOD. PICS OF GOOD QUALITY, THOUGH LITTLE AMOUNT OF BLURNESS REMAINS IN THE PICS TAKEN.
      
      3. 8GB INTERNAL MEMORY OF WHICH 5GB IS USER AVAILABLE.
      
      4. TOUCH IS SUPER SMOOTH. I HAVE COMPARED IT WITH SOME OF THE GALAXY PHONES. TOUCH IS REALLY GOOD.
      
      5. FREE MUSIC FROM NOKIA MUSIC STORE FOR 3 MONTHS.
      
      
      SUMMARY: A SMARTPHONE USER WANTS TO USE THE APPS AND FEATURES NOW. NOT WAIT UNTILL UPDATES ARE RELEASED AND APPS ARE AVAILABLE LONG AFTER ANDROID AND IOS USERS GET IT.
      
      IF MS AND NOKIA CAN FIX THESE ISUES ASAP, THEY HAV A GOOD CHANCE OF GETTING A DECENT SHARE OF SMARTPHONE MARKET ELSE, NOKIA CAN PACK THERE BAGS. THE PROB HERE IS THERE ARE NO OTHER GOOD PHONES WITH SIIMILAR SPECS AT THIS PRICE POINT IN ANDROID. SAMSUNG HAV COME UP WITH GALAXY ACE 3. LETS C HOW IT DOES WHEN IT COMES TO THE MARKET. ANOTHER STRONG CONTENDER WOULD BE GALAXY S4 MINI ONLY IF SAMSUNG PRICES IT BELOW 15K. HOPE U LIKED MY REVIEW. CHAO"
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"MY EXPECTATION WERE VERY HIGH FROM THIS PHONE..THOUGH THE LOOKS ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE WP8 IS REALLY FRUSTRATING AND I AM NOT A ALL ENJOYING THIS PHONE..I AM CURSING MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING BOUGHT AN ANDROID PHONE..THERE ARE NO EQUALIZERS IN THIS PHONE SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOME GOOD MUSIC THEN THIS IS NOT THE PHONE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR...ANYWAYS THE PHONE IS DECENT ENOUGH IF YOU DISCOUNT THESE ASPECTS,PARTICULARLY THE DISPLAY IS GOOD,AND THE PHONE GIVES A FEEL OF ONE WHICH IS ABOVE THE 20K RANGE,SO OVERALL I WOULD SAY IF YOU HAVE ABOUT 10K AND WANT TO TEST IF YOU LIKE THE WP8 THEN THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU,BUT OTHERWISE I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS ONE."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"NOT SURE HOW MOST PEOPLE SAY IT IS AVERAGE OR GOOD ENOUGH, BUT I PERSONALLY FIND IT NOT ENOUGH TO LAST FROM MORNING TILL EVENING, AT LEAST DURING OFFICE HOURS.
      
      
      THE REST IS COOL!
      
      
      ALL APPS WORK WELL
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD
      
      EASY TO HOLD, AND HARD
      
      NO ISSUES WITH DISPLAY AS WRITTEN BY SOME GUYS [YOU CAN EASILY USE IT INDOORS AND IN SUN LIGHT]"
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"ONE OF THE HIGH POINTS OF THE NOKIA LUMIA 520 IS THE DESIGN. THAT'S A HALLMARK OF NOKIA'S WINDOWS PHONES: THE ENTIRE RANGE IS INTERESTING TO LOOK AT, NICE TO HOLD AND ISN'T AFRAID TO USE COLOUR. HENCE WE'RE HOLDING THE YELLOW 520 AND WE HAVE TO SAY IT'S A REFRESHING CHANGE FROM THE SEA OF BLACK, WHITE OR SILVER PHONES YOU FIND ELSEWHERE."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"PHONE IS GETTING HEAT WHILE USING DATA CONNECTION FOR MORE THEN 20 MINUTES.
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS ONLY 4 HOURS ON DATA CONNECTION.
      
      OVERALL DISPLAY QUALITY AND CLEARITY IS GOOD ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SOMEONE TOWARDS IT ."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,PHONE WAS GETTING HEATED WITH VERY NORMAL USE. WILE PLAYING GAMES PHONE IS GETTING TOO MUCH HEATED. DON KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM FACED SAME PROBLEM. NEED FLASH FOR CAMERA OVERALL PHONE IS OK AND I HAVE ASKED FLIPKART FOR REPLACEMENT
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"PROS -&GT;
      
      
      1. GREAT CALL QUALITY
      
      2. SPEAKERS ARE LOUD
      
      3. TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS OKAY , GIVEN THE PRICE YOU ARE PAYING
      
      4. RUNS SMOOTHLY WHATSOEVER
      
      
      CONS -&GT;
      
      
      1. DID NOT LIKE THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM OVER ANDROID OR IOS , ALTHOUGH I'M NOT AN APP JUNKY SORT OF PERSON
      
      2. BLACKS ARE NOT THAT DENSE"
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"PROS : BEST PHONE BELOW 13K IN TERMS OF USER INTERFACE,SPEED,BATTERY BACKUP AND LOOKS. WINDOWS 8 OS FOR THIS PRICE IS A BIG ADVANTAGE.
      
      
      CONS : THE DISPLAY GLASS - IF YOU DROP THIS PHONE ONCE, THE GLASS IS GOING TO BREAK VERY BADLY. ONLY OPTION YOU HAVE LEFT IS TO REPLACE THE BROKEN GLASS WHICH COSTS ABOUT 2700 BUCKS.
      
      
      THIS PHONE DOES NOT COME WITH A GORILLA GLASS. IN LUMIA SERIES GORILLA GLASS APPEARS IN 710,720,800,810,900,920 AND ABOVE. SO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T DROP THIS PHONE WHILE USING IT, OTHERWISE IT IS GOING TO BE A SAD DEAL. MAY BE THE SHARP EDGE DESIGN AND WEAK GLASS MAKES THE SCREEN VULNERABLE TO CRACK. MY LUMIA 520 ON ITS 2ND WEEK FELL OFF MY HAND TO THE FLOOR AND RESULT IS A 2700 BUCK DAMAGE :(
      
      
      SO I WOULD LIKE TO ADVICE YOU GUYS TO KEEP THIS IN MIND WHILE BUYING THIS PHONE. OTHER THAN THAT THE PHONE IS GREAT."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"RIGHT TO THE POINT
      
      PROS:
      
      1&GT; PHONE HARDWARE IS GREAT. DUAL CORE , 5 MEG CAMERA , 4 INCH IPS
      
      2&GT; WINDOW OS LOOKS IS EYE CATCHING
      
      
      BUT
      
      CONS:
      
      1&GT; MANY APPS WHICH ARE FREE IN ANDRIOD ARE PAID IN WINDOWS
      
      2&GT; WHEN COMPARED TO ANDRIOD , ONE CAN SEE THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF APPS IN WINDOWS ARE  LIMITED
      
      3&GT; WINDOWS DOES NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE FILE SYSTEM. CANNOT BROWSE THE FILES IN THE PHONE OF SD CARD THROUGH PHONE UI . IT SUCKS
      
      4&GT; WHEN I PUT MUSIC FILES MANUALLY IN THE PHONE , THE PHONE LIST THE FILE 3 TIMES IN THE PLAYLIST AND ALSO PLAYS 3 TIMES TOO :-(
      
      5&GT; CONTACTS HAS TO BE PART OF SOME ACCOUNT . WHY ?
      
      
      MY TAKE 5 STAR FOR HARDWARE BUT 3 START TO THE WINDOWS OS."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"SINCE IT WAS MY 1ST SMART PHONE, WAS REALLY HAPPY INITIALLY WITH THE PHONE. BUT AS I STARTED EXPLORING THE PHONE, I REALLY WISH THE PHONE COULD HAVE OFFERED SLIGHTLY MORE.
      
      I WAS AWARE OF THE OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS LIKE NO FRONT CAMERA, NO FLASH, ONLY 512 MB RAM, 800 X 480 (235 PPI) RESOLUTION, NO FM, AND MANY MORE.
      
      
      BUT WHEN I USED THE PHONE FOR A MONTH I FOUND THAT THE BATTERY IS NOT SO GOOD, PHONE HEATS UP IF YOU PLAY GAMES FOR EVEN HALF AN HOUR, LIMITATION OF WINDOWS 8 APPS (OF COURSE ITS NOT A PROBLEM OF THE PHONE), POOR LOUDSPEAKER, CAMERA COMPLETELY USELESS IN NIGHT, AND FINALLY THE POWER/LOCK BUTTON IS ON THE RIGHT CENTER SIDE WHICH WE TEND TO ALWAYS SELECT BY MISTAKE WHENEVER ONE HOLDS THE PHONE!
      
      
      HOWEVER, FOR THIS PRICE ( 9.5K ) I WOULD STILL SAY IT'S A GREAT PHONE, AND BETTER THAN ANY PHONE IN THE MARKET NOW! WISH WINDOWS 8 PHONES HAVE MORE GAMES AND APPS!!!"
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"SORRY NOKIA/WINDOWS FANS. BUT, NOKIA LUMIA 520 IS A NIGHTMARE FOR ANDROID USERS.
      
      CONS --&GT;
      
      1. THE APPS ARE OF ""STONE AGE"" .. FOR.E.G.. WHATSAPP ,CRICINFO ...1GHZ 500RAM DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE WHEN UR APPS ARE OF OLD TECHNOLOGY. THE EXISTING APPS ARE NOT USER FRIENDLY.
      
      2. BATTERY LIFE - 9AM TO 6PM ONLY (9HRS, I ONLY GET 10-12 CALLS A DAY)
      
      3. MUSIC PLAYER IS A JOKE. NO EQUALIZER ! U NEED TO INVEST EXTRA MONEY TO BUY A HEADPHONE. MUSIC PLAYS FLAT ON EARPHONES &AMP; THIS INFORMATION IS ALSO NOT GIVEN IN THE MANUAL. I HAD TO SEARCH ON THE INTERNET FOR THIS SOLUTION.
      
      
      PROS --&GT;
      
      1. MUSIC PLAYS WELL ON HEADPHONES.
      
      2. STYLISH &AMP; SLEEK LOOK.
      
      3.THOSE WHO HAVNT USED ANDROID PHONES MAY FIND THIS PHONE GOOD AND ITS A GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT. ITS ALWAYS BETTER THAN BLACKBERRY.
      
      4. SUPER SENSITIVE TOUCH SCREEN
      
      
      WILL KEEP UPDATING YOU GUYS AS I DISCOVER NEW THINGS."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"SPECIFICATION WISE THIS MOB IS GREAT AND MANY TIMES WISH TO PURCHASE IT.BUT AGAIN PUT BACK MY STEP.THE REASON VIRUS.MY INTERNET USE IS VAST .I SHIFTED TO LINUX ONLY BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS TROUBLES TO MY WINDOWS PC.TRIED MANY ANTIVIRUS.NONE OF THEM SOLVED MY PROBLEM. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM IN RESPECT OF THIS MOB AS IT IS A WINDOWS BASED PHONE.FOR LAST 3 YEARS I AM USING ANDROID MOBS.SO FAR THIS PROBLEM IS CONCERNED I HAVE NEVER FACED THIS PROBLEM THAT TOO WITHOUT ANY ANTIVIRUS.
      
      AS I HAVE NOT USED THIS PHONE TO RATE IT IS DIFFICULT. STILL I WILL RATE 3 FOR IT'S SPECIFICATIONS"
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"THIS IS THE FIRST WINDOWS PHONE IVE USED BUT SERIOUSLY IT SUCKS ... THE OS ITSELF IS CRAPPY WITH NO ROOM FOR MODIFICATION ,,,AFTER USING ANDROID AND IOS THIS OS IS TOO INFERIOR ... LACK OF APPS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE ,,, ALL THE APPS U FIND ARE OF NO USE FREE GAMES ON ANDROID SUCH AS ANGRY BIRDS COST U 55RS  NO IMPRESSIVE GAMES ... CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE
      
      
      SO VERDICT GO FIND AN JELLY BEAN O AN ICS PHONE LIKE THE KARBONN S1 O A MMX PIXEL A90S ULL LOVE USING IT"
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"TILL YESTERDAY, THIS PRODUCT WAS WITH A FREEBIE OFFER OF 8 GB MEMORY CARD WORTH RS.320 AND THE OFFER WAS VALID TILL 31ST JULY. TODAY I.E. ON 8TH JULY, THIS OFFER IS NOT THERE. FLIPKART NEEDS TO MAINTAIN THEIR STAND ON ANY OFFER."
Nokia Lumia 520,3,"WHATSAPP MESSAGES RECIEVES WITH SOME DELAY,,,NICE PHONE BUT NOT USER FRIENDLY,,,CANT USE MUSIC FILES AS RINGTONES,,DONT KNOW WHY BUT DATA CONNECTION STOPS WHILE ROAMING..SOMETIMES GETS HANGED ALSO,,,HEATING WHILE CHARGING &AMP; CALLING IS ALSO A CONCERN,,,OVERALL NICE PHONE"
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"BOUGHT NOKIA LUMIA 520(CYAN) IN THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY'13.
      
      OF COURSE THE FLIPKART SERVICE WAS GOOD. DELIVERED BEFORE EXPECTED TIME.
      
      WELL WITH IN TWO WEEKS THE PHONE STARTED GIVING ME TROUBLES.
      
      IT STARTED HANGING A LOT AND WITHIN HALF HOUR OF USAGE THE BACK AREA NEAR THE CAMERA STARTS HEATING UP BADLY.
      
      COMPLAINED THE ISSUE TO FLIPKART, THEY ASKED ME TO RESET MY PHONE. I DID, BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK  OUT. AGAIN CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER CARE, INSTEAD OF RESOLVING THE ISSUE THEY SIMPLY ASKED ME TO GET IN TOUCH WITH NOKIA CARE.(THOUGH FLIPKART PROVIDES A 30 DAYS REPLACEMENT GAURANTEE, BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED).
      
      UNFORTUNATELY, MY WORK SCHEDULE DIDN'T ALLOW ME TO GO TO A NOKIA CARE CENTRE AND GET THE ISSUE RESOLVED. AND ITS BECAUSE OF MY BUSY SCHEDULE ONLY I DECIDE TO BUY CELLPHONE FROM FLIPKART.
      
      THE DAYS PASSED AND PROBLEM GOT WORSE, NOW THE PHONE TURNS OFF ITSELF AND DOESN'T TURN ON EVEN USING THE POWER BUTTON.
      
      ONE HAS TO REINSERT THE BATTERY IN ORDER TO SWITCH HIS PHONE ON
      
      THIS IS WHAT I FACED DURING FIRST MONTH OF USAGE.
      
      IN THE SECOND MONTH THE EAR PIECE STOPPED WORKING, THE SENSOR ON THE SCREEN QUIT AND THE LOCK/POWER BUTTON AND THE CAMERA BUTTON STOPPED WORKING PROPERLY.
      
      SERIOUSLY, I REGRET BUYING THIS SHITTY PHONE.
      
      2 STAR FOR THIS MOBILE, ONLY FOR ITS GRAPHICS AND THE NEWNESS IT BROUGHT TO THE MARKET APART FROM ANDROID."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"DESIGN AND BUILD:
      
      NOKIA HAS CREATED A BEAUTY IN THE FORM OF LUMIA520. HAS A GOOD FEEL, THE BACK COVER HAS DECENT GRIP, EASY FOR SINGLE HAND OPERATION. THE PHONE FEELS STURDY AND WILL CERTAINLY SURVIVE SOME ACCIDENTAL FALLS. AS THE SPEAKER IS NOT PLACED WELL, ONE HAS TO PLACE THE PHONE FACE DOWN IF YOU HAVE TO HEAR THE PHONE RING. IF IN NOISY ENVIRONMENT YOU ARE CERTAIN TO MISS SOME CALLS.
      
      DISPLAY AND TOUCH:
      
      THE LCD DISPLAY PRODUCES DECENT COLORS AND ALSO HAS DECENT SUNLIGHT READABILITY. THERE IS AN OPTION IN SETTINGS TO ENHANCE THIS FEATURE BUT AT THE COST OF FASTER BATTERY DRAIN. THE DISPLAY CERTAINLY LACKS THE CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY. THERE ARE ONLY 3 LEVELS OF BRIGHTNESS AND AUTO BRIGHTNESS. IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO HAVE A LINEAR BRIGHTNESS ADJUSTMENT LIKE IN ANDROID. THE TOUCH SENSITIVITY OF THE PHONE IS GOOD.
      
      OS, UI AND APPS:
      
      THE BEST OF THE OS RIGHT NOW WHICH DOES A FANTASTIC JOB, NO BUGGY LAGS AND CRASHES WHICH GIVES YOU PEACE OF MIND. THE OS DOES NOT ALLOW ONE TO INSTALL APPS IN SD CARD AS OF NOW. THE UI IS NEAT AND FAST. THE WINDOWS STORE IS YET TO GROW. I FELT LACK OF DROPBOX, GOOD BATTERY MANAGEMENT APPS, GOOGLE DRIVE, GOOGLE PLUS, ETC. A BIG LETDOWN. HOPE THOSE APPS MAKE IT INTO THE WINDOWS STORE. THE PEOPLE APP PROVIDES CONNECTIONS TO FACEBOOK, TWITTER, LINKEDIN WHICH IS A GOOD FEATURE. THE CONTACT MANAGEMENT IS ALSO GOOD.
      
      INTERNET:
      
      IE IS THE BEST PHONE BROWSER I'VE SEEN SO FAR. HAVE USED STOCK BROWSERS IN GALAXY ACE, HTC DESIRE X, GALAXY S II, GALAXY NOTE. HAVE USED CHROME AND FIREFOX IN THESE PHONES EXCEPT IN ACE. OUT OF THESE IE IS THE BEST.
      
      BATTERY:
      
      THIS IS THE WORST PART IN THE PHONE. THE 1430MAH POWER IS JUST NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS DEVICE. MAILS SYNC EVERY TWO HOURS (2 ACCOUNTS), OPENED COUPLE OF INTERESTING LINKS WHILE CHECKING TWITTER (OPENED 8 LINKS). HAVEN'T PLAYED ANY GAMES AND NO MUSIC OR VIDEO STREAMING AND NO WI-FI DURING THIS PERIOD. DID NOT EVEN VISIT STORE FOR APPS DURING THIS TIME WHICH MEANS NO WHATSAPP. RECEIVED 5 TEXT MESSAGES, RECEIVED 3 CALLS EACH LASTING 10 MINUTES OR SO. THE BRIGHTNESS WAS SET TO LOW AND IN JUST 6 HOURS THE BATTERY FELL FROM 100% TO 30%. ONCE THE BATTERY LEVEL REACHES 20% THE STOCK BATTERY SAVER KICKS IN AND SAVES THE JUICE BUT DURING THAT TIME ALL AUTO SYNC IS TURNED OFF.
      
      TO TEST FURTHER, CHARGED THE PHONE TO 100% AND SWITCHED OFF DATA CONNECTION AND VOILA THE PHONE HAS JUST LOST 5% IN 6 HOURS. RECEIVED 5 CALLS WITH TOTAL TALK TIME OF 45 MINUTES. RECEIVED 10 TEXT MESSAGES AND SENT 6.
      
      SO, THE CULPRIT IS DATA CONNECTION WHICH KILLS THE BATTERY. BUT, WHAT IS THE POINT IN GETTING THIS PHONE WHEN IT CANNOT LAST EVEN A DAY WITH DATA CONNECTED? MAILS CAN BE SYNCED MANUALLY, WHICH AGAIN KILLS THE BATTERY AS I TRIED EVEN THAT. ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS RATE OF KILL WAS SLOWER BUT STILL, IT WON'T LAST A DAY.
      
      TELEPHONY AND MESSAGING:
      
      THE ONE THING THIS BEAUTY DOES IS GOOD TELEPHONY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT THAT SMART IT IS STILL A PHONE. THE CALL RECEPTION AND QUALITY WAS EXTREMELY GOOD. BOTH PERSONS WERE ABLE TO HEAR THE OTHER'S VOICE LOUD AND CLEAR EVEN IN THE LOWEST OF NETWORK COVERAGE. THE PHONE IS ALSO A DELIGHT FOR TEXTING.
      
      OVERALL:
      
      THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING THEIR FIRST SMARTPHONE AND INTEND TO USE IT FOR BASIC TELEPHONE AND TEXTING. FOR INTERNET USERS, FORGET THIS."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"DONT GO FOR THIS MOBILE AFTER USING SYMBAIN OR ANDROID BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE IN JAIL, ALL YOUR FREEDOM IS TAKEN BY WINDOWS. LIKE COUNTING JAIL BARS YOU HAVE TO COUNT THAT IDIOT TILES.
      
      THIS IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRY WINDOWS.
      
      
      GOOD THING IS VERY CAPABLE HARDWARE, FREE MAPS , FIRST CLASS NOKIA SUPPORT, DIFFERNT FROM ANDROID, AND CUTE DESIGN WITH DIFFERENT COLORS.
      
      
      IN SHORT I LOVE NOKIA BUT HATE WINDOWS.NOW I AM BACK TO ANDROID."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"EVERYTHING'S O.K. BUT 2MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE.
      
      1- SOFTWARE HAVING NO FILE MANAGER AND UNABLE TO TRANSFER YOUTUBE VIDEOS FROM PHONE TO MEMORY CARD AND PC.
      
      2- HARDWARE THE PHONE HEATS UP EVEN IN A 3-5 MIN CALL. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GAMING AND USING THE INTERNET. YOU CAN'T HOLD THE PHONE WITHOUT GLOVES."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"GREAT SPECS FOR AFFORDABLE PRICE KUDOS TO NOKIA. ON WINDOWS FRONT I AIN'T IMPRESSED BY ANY SINGLE FEATURE. NO TRUE MULTI-TASKING, ONLY A FEW APPS RUN IN BACKGROUND, WHICH I CAN'T DECIDE. GOOGLE SERVICES SUCKS ON WINDOWS PHONE. NO FILE MANAGER MAKES IT MUCH HARDER TO LOCATE DOCUMENTS. NO ADOBE PDF READER AND WE CAN'T READ DOCS FROM SD CARD. VERY BASIC EDITING ONLY CAN BE DONE IN OFFICE AND WE CAN'T SAVE DOCS IN SD CARD. I HAD BEEN ANDROID USER. JUST FOR CHANGE I BOUGHT THIS WINDOWS PHONE. WITH ANDROID I NEVER FELT THE NEED FOR PC. IT ISN'T THE CASE WITH WINDOWS PHONE. FOR THOSE WHO USE GOOGLE SERVICES MOSTLY GO FOR ANDROID. IT'S SMARTER THAN WINDOWS. LUMIA PHONES COMES WITH KILLER HARDWARE AND LESS CAPABLE WINDOWS SOFTWARE ."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"HI FRIENDS
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ONE DAY BEFORE AND TODAY I AM TRYING TO SEE IT.
      
      
      THE PHONE DO NOT HAVE OPTION TO RECORD OUR CALLS. FOR PPL WHO NEED TO RECORD THERE MEETINGS .... PLS DONT GO FOR THIS PHONE.
      
      
      ELSE EVERY THING IS FINE.
      
      
      PLS NOTE : THERE IS NO CALL RECORDING OPTION .. I WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS EARLIER. I WOULD HAVE NOT GONE FOR THIS IF I REALISED IT WHEN I BOUGHT IT."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"HI GUYS, SORRY IF MY FEEDBACKS ARE DIS-APPOINTING WINDOWS PHONE LOVERS. BUT MY FEEDBACKS ARE FROM MY HANDSON EXPERIENCE WITH LUMIA, NOT ONLY FROM SEEING VIDEOS OR BEING JUST AN WP LOVER. I WOULD SUGGEST YOU.... GETS SOME HANDS ON EXPERIENCE WORKING ON THIS PHONE, BEFORE YOU BUY!
      
      
      I FIND BELOW STUFFS ARE NOT GOOD COMPARE TO ANDROID.
      
      
      1. APPS, PEOPLE SAY MORE APPS ARE COMING WHEN? WHEN? WHEN? THERE ARE PLENTY OF APPS WHICH CANNOT COUNT AND SUITS PEOPLE MOODS.... IF YOU FIND FOR AN APP IN GOOGLE PLAY STORE YOU GET QUITE # OF APPS AVAILABLE TO INSTALL, TRY SAME IN MICROSOFT PHONE STORE, VERY LESS NUMBER OF APPS YOU GET, SOME TIMES BLANK. MAY BE U CAN TAKE FACEBOOK AS EXAMPLE AND TRY IT. NOW A DAYS PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT APPS FROM DIFFERENT DEVELOPERS WITH DIFFERENT FEATURES WHICH FITS BETS TO THEIR MOOD AND ON THEIR DEVICE.... ANDROID FULFILLS THIS THINKING NEED TO PEOPLE... NO WP :-(
      
      
      2. SPEEEED. SPEEED.... SPEEED... WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME, I CANNOT SIT AND WATCH PHONE FOR SECONDS OR MAY BE HALF MINUTE FOR AN APP TO OPEN. WP DOES WORKS SLOW OPENING APPS COMPARING ANDROID. COMPARE SECONDS WHERE THESE PHONES TAKES TIME TO OPEN APP (EXAMPLE:WHATSAPP) COMPARE WITH LOW BUDGET ANDROID PHONE WITH THIS WP... LOW BUDGET ANDROID PHONE BEATS PERFORMANCE OF APP.....
      
      
      3. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BLEND OF FB (MESSAGE),   OUTLOOK AND CONTACTS AS PEOPLE (MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS FEEDS) WORKS GREAT IN WP... BUT THATS NOT ONLY THE THING WHICH WE NEED IN A PHONE..... PUT FEW MINUTES OF UR TIME WORKING IN FB OF WP...  U CANNOT LIKE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE COMMENTS, U CANNOT VIEW LOCAL  LANGUAGE POST (U CAN SEE ONLY RECTANGLE SYMBOL THERE) WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR ME, I THINK SAME AT UR END.... ANDROID DOES THIS EFFICIENTLY WITH FACEBOOK APP (THOUGH DO NOT HAVE FACEBOOK CONTACTS LINKED INTO CONTACTS) THE SAME EXPERIENCE OF FB WITH PC U GET IN ANDROID.. ALSO THE PERFORMANCE AND SPEED OF THE FACEBOOK APP IN ANDROID IS FAR BETTER THAN WP.. .COMPARE THE SPEED GUYS BY WORKING ON A APP BETWEEN THESE OPERATING SYSTEMS. THEN YOU CAN DECIDED.. WHICH OS IS BETTER....
      
      
      4. NOKIA DRIVE.... AWESOME APP WHICH IS BEST DRIVE MAP APPLICATION WHEN COMPARING ANDROID AND IOS, BUT NOKIA MAPS AND BING MAPS ARE .... I WOULD SAY THUMPS DOWN HERE.... AGAIN TRY WORKING ON THIS WP MAP APP AND COMPARE IT WITH ANDROID, I WAS USING MOTOROLA CHARM WHICH WAS HAVING 2.1 ECLAIR OS, WHERE GOOGLE APP WORKS GREAT THAN CURRENT WP....
      
      
      WE ALL KNOW NOKIA IS AT ITS BEST FOR ITS HARDWARE, MODEL, DESIGN, STURDY, BATTERY BACKUP AND SO ON... I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH WINDOWS PHONE OS TILL I USE IT... :-( I AM REALLY WONDERING NOW WHY NOKIA IS NOT MAKING ANDROID PHONE... WHO KNOW WE MAY SEE ANDROID IN NOKIA SOON... :-)"
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"HI GUYS...JUST PURCHASED THIS PHONE...NOT FROM FLIPKART THOUGH....
      
      
      I FOUND ONE THING VERY SAD...U CAN CONNECT TO WIFI...BUT U CANT MANUALLY CHANGE THE IP AND DNS SETTINGS OF ANY WINDOWS PHONE...!!
      
      EVEN MICROSOFT DOESN'T HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THAT...
      
      
      BAD THING FOR ALL WINDOWS PHONES...:("
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"HOW MANY APPS CAN BE INSTALLED IN 512 MB RAM OF LUMIA SERIES PHONES? ARE THERE ANY RESTRICTIONS AS SUCH THAT AFTER INSTALLING A NUMBER OF APPS IT WILL REFUSE TO INSTALL NEW APPS OR SIMPLY THE PHONE'S SPEED WILL COME DOWN DRASTICALLY? IT HAPPENS IN MY ANDROID, SO I WANT TO CLARIFY BEFORE INVESTING IN THIS PHONE! ANYONE?"
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY LUMIA SERIES IS NOT HAVING SOME BASIC FEATURES. I.E. DATA USAGE AND SMS COUNTER AND SPL CALL TIMING LOG. ITS THE VERY BASIC FEATURE WHICH IS THE MOST NEEDED THING AND IS MISSING. WHAT THE HELL. HOW ARE U GUYS GOING TO COMPETE WITH YOUR RIVALS.
      
      I WAS A DAM NOKIA FAN. FROM 1100-3610-6600-7610-6260-6681-E63 AND FINALLY N8, I HAVE BOUGHT ALL OF THEM, I WAS HAPPY AND SATISFIED. BUT THEN I BOUGHT NOKIA LUMIA 520 AND WITHIN 15 DAYS I AM GOING TO SELL IT. I HAVE AN AIRTEL POST PAID CONNECTION WITH LIMITED INTERNET, I WAS SHOCKED WHEN MY BILL CAME MY DATA USAGE WAS OVER AND IT COST ME 1500 EXCESS AS I CANT CHECK IT.
      
      
      I HEARD ABOUT DATA SENSE BUT AFTER ONE YEAR OF ITS RELEASE ITS NOT THERE IN STORE.
      
      EXCEPT THAT PHONE IS AWESOME NO DOUBT. IF ANYONE KNOWS THE SOLUTION THEN DO TELL ME."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"I HAVE BEEN USING LUMIA 520 FOR THREE MONTHS NOW AND OVERALL NOT VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER FOR THIS OS. I HAVE BEEN STARTED GETTING NEW PROBLEM WITH EVERY COMING WEEK.
      
      
      I AM GONNA LIST FEW MAJOR ONE HERE AS FOLLOWS:
      
      
      - PHONE REBOOTS ALOT - HAVE TRIED HARD RESET MUTLIPLE TIMES AND NOW BECAME VERY SELECTIVE WITH NEW APPS BUT STILL PROBLEM REMAIN THERE
      
      - PHONE HEATS ALOT WITH 10 MINS OF USAGE
      
      - MUSIC WILL STUCK FOR BRIEF I.E. 1 OR 2 SECOND WHILE PLAYING, HAVE TRIED MOVING THE MUSIC FROM PHONE TO SD CARD AND VICE-VERSA BUT STILL REMAIN THE SAME, THESE ALL SONGS ARE DOWNLOAD FROM NOKIA MUSIC. DONT KNOW WHATS WRONG ---- BUT WHEN I PLAY SAME MUSIC FROM MY COMPUTER IT DOES NOT.
      
      - OTHER STORAGE KEEP GROWING EVERY DAY, TRIED TURNING OFF THER AUTO UPLOAD TO SKYDRIVE AND CLEARING THE HISTORY BUT THAT DOES NOT SEEMS TO BE WORKING. I AM LEFT WITH ONLY 1 GB OF FREE SPACE.
      
      - UPDATES ARE VERY SLOW, YET TO SEE ANY UPDATE TO SOLVE THESE MAJOR PROBLEMS.
      
      MICROSOFT ITSELF NOT KEEN TO RELEASE NEW APPLICATION FOR ITS OS LIKE NEW RELEASE OF SKYPE WITH BETTER FEATURES RELEASED FOR OTHER TWO PLATFORM AND EVEN FOR BLACKBERRY OS WHICH IS YET TO GAIN ANY GROUND.
      
      - NOTIFICATION CENTER NEED BIG TIME ENHANCEMENT AS AFTER SOME TIME USAGE, YOU FEEL TIRING CLICKING MULTIPLE TIMES TO ENABLE OR DISABLE SOME FEATURES. I HAVE CONNECTIVITY TILE WHICH GIVES SOME RELIEF THOUGH.
      
      - USER SHOULD HAVE MORE CUSTOMIZATION ACCESS FOR TILES, THEY CAN LEARN SOME FROM IOS7 THOUGH AGAIN ITS SEEMS TO BE INSPIRED MORE FROM WP8 BUT THEY HAVE MADE GOOD USE OF AVAILABLE FEATURES.
      
      - MOST OF BEST APPS ARE PAID ON WP8 WHILE SAME APPS ARE AVAILABLE FREE OF COST ON ANDROID, CANT UNDERSTAND THE REASON.
      
      
      LAST BUT NOT LEAST, RECENTLY MY PHONE WILL NOT WAKEUP WHEN I AM NOT USING AND ITS LOCKED, THE ONLY OPTION IS TO REMOVE THE BATTERY AND THEN RESTART."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST 3 WEEKS. EARLIER I WAS USING AN ANDROID PHONE. SO I HAVE EXPERIENCE IN USING BOTH OS. HERE IS MY FEEDBACK ON NOKIA LUMIA 520/ WINDOWS 8 OS.
      
      PROS:
      
      1.	NEW, REFRESHING UI. AT LEAST THE HOME SCREEN FEELS GREAT WITH THE NEW TILES FEATURE
      
      2.	ABSOLUTELY BUTTERY AND SMOOTH EXPERIENCE, NO LAG AT ALL
      
      3.	VERY GOOD SOUND QUALITY, WHILE CALLING, ON OR OFF-SPEAKER
      
      4.	FREE DOWNLOAD OF ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MUSIC
      
      5.	FREE MOVIES WITH BIG FLIX APP
      
      6.	LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST EXCELLENT PRICE (&LT; 10K)
      
      CONS:
      
      1.	TYPING EXPERIENCE NOT SO GREAT. THEY HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE ON THEIR DICTIONARY THAT THEY DON?T ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE A LETTER IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORD. SO ONCE YOU HAVE TYPES SOMETHING LINE ?HERSH? AND WANT TO CORRECT IT TO ?HURSH? (MAY BE YOUR FRIEND SPELLS HIS NAME LIKE THIS), IT FORCES YOU TO PICK UP THE WORD ?HARSH? FROM THE DICTIONARY. YOU CANNOT GO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORD AND CORRECT JUST ONE LETTER. THE ONLY OPTION YOU HAVE IS TO ERASE THE ENTIRE WORD AND TYPE IT AGAIN. I FOUND THIS QUITE ABSURD. IT BECOMES MUCH MORE PAINFUL IF YOU ARE TYPING IN A LOCAL LANGUAGE AND USING LONGER WORDS, ONE MISTAKE AND ERASE THE WHOLE WORD. (I WOULD APPRECIATE IF SOMEONE HAS FOUND A SOLUTION TO IT AND CAN SHARE THE SAME WITH ME).
      
      2.	ABSOLUTELY POOR IN NUMBER AND QUALITY OF APPS. THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THE APP STORE OF ANDROID (GOOGLE PLAY) AND WINDOWS (STORE). THERE ARE SO MANY WONDERFUL AND PRODUCTIVE APPS FOR ANDROID BUT VERY FEW, RATHER NONE, FOR WINDOWS. LOOK FOR APPS FOR BANKS, NEWS,  ...., ....., AND YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE. WHEN I WAS USING ANDROID EVERYDAY I USED TO SEE NEW AND BETTER APPS, IN WP I GO TO THE STORE AND EVERY TIME I SEE THE SAME APP GIVING ME A FEELING THAT NO ONE IS INTERESTED IN WP APPS.  WITHOUT APPS A SMART PHONE IS NOWHERE EVEN CLOSE TO BEING SMART.  OLDER NOKIA PHONES WERE EQUALLY GOOD.
      
      3.	VIDEO PLAYER :- OMG. THIS IS THE WORST THING ONE CAN SEE IN A SMART PHONE. YOU PLAY THE VIDEO AND LET IT GO. YOU DON?T HAVE A CONTROL ON THE HORIZONTAL BAR SO IF YOU WANT TO FORWARD IT TO THE TIME, SAY, 10:20, YOU CANNOT DO THAT. THERE IS A FORWARD BUTTON, BUT IT IS TOO BASIC TO SAY THE LEAST. I HAVE STOPPED WATCHING VIDEOS ON THIS PHONE.
      
      4.	 SOME OF THE BASIC THINGS, SUCH AS CHANGING THE RING TONE TO THE SONG YOU LIKE HAS BEEN MADE SO CUMBERSOME. YOU NEED TO CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO A COMPUTER COPY THE SONG INTO RINGTONE FOLDER BEFORE YOU CAN SET IT AS THE PHONE?S RINGTONE. IN MY OPINION THIS IS QUITE LAME.
      
      5.	MS FORCES YOU TO USE ITS OWN APPLICATIONS EVERY NOW AND THEN. WHILE CREATING A CONTACT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HOTMAIL ACCOUNT AND A CONTACT WOULD BE CREATED AS HOTMAIL CONTACT. FURTHER WHILE USING MANY APPLICATIONS, I FELT LIKE BEING FORCED TO SHARE MY DATA AND INFORMATION WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE WITH ANDROID.
      
      6.	FONT SIZE:- ALL I CAN SAY IS THE FONT SIZE ON VARIOUS SCREENS WERE DECIDED BY SOME BRAIN-DEAD DESIGNER. THE USEFUL INFORMATION WILL BE DISPLAYED AT 1/10TH SIZE OF THE UNWANTED INFORMATION.  PART OF THE TEXT FROM THE NEXT SCREEN WILL KEEP HANGING ON THE CURRENT SCREEN, WHICH INITIALLY LOOKS LIKE A BUG BEFORE YOU GET USED TO IT.
      
      
      OVERALL, I USE THIS PHONE MOSTLY FOR RECEIVING AND MAKING CALLS, BROWSING AND DOING THINGS WHICH CAN BE DONE USING EXPLORER. I NO LONGER GET THE FEEL OF USING A SMART PHONE WITH LUMIA 520.
      
      WHEN I WAS USING ANDROID PHONE, I WAS MUCH HAPPIER WITH MY ?SMART? PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"I HAVE NOKIA LUMIA 520 SINCE FIFTEEN DAYS AGO AND I AM TOTALLY BORED BY THIS PHONE, THE PHONE LACKS MANY BASIC FEATURES. I AM NOT SATISFYING WITH THE PRODUCT IT TERMS LACK OF FEATURES.
      
      
      I HAVE FOLLOWING PROBLEM WITH THE PHONE.
      
      1. PHONE DOES NOT HAVE FILE EXPLORER TO MANAGE THE FILES IN THE PHONE I.E TO EDIT, TO CUT, TO PASTE, TO DELETE A FILE. BY LACK OF THIS FEATURE WE HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE OUR PERSONAL COMPUTER/LAPTOP TO MANAGE OUR FILES. THE PERSON WHO DOES NOT HAVE PC/LAPTOP CANNOT EDIT THE FILE.
      
      
      2. THE PHONE READS THE FILE FROM THE PHONE DOCUMENT FOLDER, ONLY THOSE DOCUMENTS FILES ARE READ BY PHONE WHICH ARE IN SUCH FOLDER. IN DOCUMENT FOLDER WE CANNOT CREATE FOLDERS TO MANAGE OR CLASSIFY THE FILES.
      
      
      3. IN THE LUMIA PHONE WE CANNOT KNOW THE CALLS DURATION FROM CALLS LOG.
      
      
      4. IT DOES NOT HAVE ITS CALLS RECORDER AND VOICE RECORDER, WHICH IS BASIC FEATURE THE PHONE.
      
      
      5 PHONE IS HEATING UP VERY USES INTERNET, WIFI, 3G, 2G, CHARGING.
      
      
      6 PHONE MUSIC VOLUME FUNCTION AND RINGTONES VOLUME FUNCTION WORKS TOGETHER, THE EFFECT OF THIS FEATURE IS THAT IF I LISTEN TO MUSIC AT LOW VOLUME ITS RINGTONE VOLUME ALSO GETS LOW AUTOMATICALLY, I U FAILS TO SET THE VOLUME TO HIGHER USER MAY FAILS TO LISTEN THE RINGTONE AND FAILS TO ATTEND THE CALL.
      
      
      7 VIBRATION OF THE PHONE IS VERY LOW AT THE TIME OF RINGING OF PHONE.
      
      
      8. WE CANNOT CUSTOMIZED THE DEFAULT BING SEARCH ENGINE TO SOME OTHER SEARCH ENGINE.
      
      
      9. MIC OF PHONE IS NOT CLEAR, THERE IS NOISE EVERYTIME, IT CREATES NOISE.
      
      
      10 CAMERA OF THE PHONE DOES NOT HAVE BASIC FEATURES LIKE BRIGNESS SETTING, SELF-POTRAIT, TIMING OPTION ETC.
      
      
      11 THE PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT FLV FILES.
      
      
      12 THE PHONE DOES NOT HAVE AUDIO SETTING.
      
      
      13 THE PHONE HAS LAGGING PROBLEM I.E IT TAKES TIME TO DISPLAY CONTENT.
      
      
      14 PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT FLASH PLAYER. YOU CANNOT PLAYS VIDEOS AND SONGS ON WEBPAGE.
      
      
      15 CANNOT ACCESS INTERNET VIA USB ON MOBILE PHONE
      
      
      THE SAID NOKIA SAYING SMARTPHONE IS NOT SATISFYING THE FEATURE OF SMARTFONE ALTHOUGH IT LACKS SOME MORE BASIC FEATURES WHICH WE FOUND IN THE PHONE RANGE BETWEEN RS. 3,000 TO RS. 5000 LIKE GOOD AUDIO BY SPEAKER, NOISE/DISTURBANCE IN THE MIC."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"I HAVE USED  WP7 PHONE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR BUT IT STILL LACKS A DECENT FACEBOOK APP AND FORGET GOOGLE + AND MAIL APPS IF YOU ARE A FREQUENT  SOCIAL NETWORK USER  FORGET ABOUT WINDOWS OS THEY SUCK I HAVE CAME BACK TO ANDROID AFTER
      
      AND THIS NOKIA PHONE LACKS FLASH SO BEWARE WHILE BUYING  FOR PHONE BUILD QUALITY  2 STARS"
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"I OWN THIS PHONE AND I FOUND MANY NEGATIVE POINTS.
      
      *CAN'T ADD RINGTONES DIRECTLY. CONNECT TO COMPUTER AND THEN DO.
      
      *CAN'T ACCESS THE MEMORY CARD.
      
      *NO PDF VIEWER.
      
      *APPS ARE MOSTLY PAID, AND SLOW.
      
      *NO SEEK BAR IN VIDEO PLAYING. THAT IS YOU CANNOT GO FORWARD OR BACKWARD.
      
      *WHEN YOU CONNECT YOUR FACEBOOK AND OTHER ACCOUNTS, YOUR PHONE WILL BE FLUSHED WITH THE FACEBOOK PHOTOS,CONTACTS ETC ETC.. WHICH IRRITATES ALOT.
      
      *IF A  MUSIC FILE DNT HAV ANY ARTIST NAME, GENRE, ALBUM NAME, BUT ONLY HAVE FILE NAME, THESE TYPES OF FILES ARE LIKE LOST IN THE PHONE. U CANNOT TRACE THEM AT ALL.
      
      *NO SEPARATE FOLDERS FOR YOUR APPS PHOTOS AND VIDEOS. FOR EXAMPLE TAKE WHATSAPP IN ANDROID, IT HAS A FOLDER FOR PHOTOS AND VIDEOS BUT IN WINDOWS , PHOTOS WILL BE SAVED IN SAVED PICTURES FOLDER. AND THE VIDEOS SAVED AT THAT PLACE , EVEN THE PHONE DNT KNO. TO PLAY THOSE VIDEOS, GO TO THAT CONTACT IN WHATSAPP, AND THEN U CAN PLAY THAT VIDEO. BUT SAME HERE, U CANNOT TRANSFER IT.
      
      *WHEN A CALL COMES, THE PHONE WILL VIBRATE ONLY TWICE! THEN ONLY THE RINGING SOUND. MOST USERS DNT FIND THIS A PROBLEM, BUT FOR ME IT IS.
      
      *MEDIA VOLUME AND PHONE RINGING VOLUME CANNOT BE CONTROLLED SEPARATELY.
      
      
      THE ONLY THING I LIKE ABOUT THE PHONE IS THE WINDOWS PRESENTATION AND THE PHONE DESIGN."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"IT IS NOT A COMPLETE PHONE---

      2. VERY POOR BATTERY LIFE...
      
      3. NO EQUALIZER..

      1.VERY VERY EXCELLENT TOUCH WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES IN THIS PRICE RANGE
      
      2.SLIM

      1.VERY VERY VERY PATHETIC BATTERY. BATTERY DOESNT EVEN LASTS FOR 12 HOURS . WITH THE USAGE OF JUST 3G ( NO CALLS , NO TEXTING , NO BROWING ) JUST DATA SERVICE ENABLED FOR FULL TIME - BATTERY DRAINED IN 9 HOURS.
      
      CONCLUSION
      
      WILL NOT SUIT THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE TRAVELLING FREQUENTLY!"
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"PURCHASED THIS PHONE .  BUT THERE SEEMS A MAJOR FLAW WITH THIS PHONE  THAT WIFI DOES NOT WORK.
      
      
      IT SHOWS CONNECTED TO THE WIFI NETWORK .BUT SURFING USING THE WIFI IS NOT POSSIBLE . THE WIFI WORKS WITH OTHER DEVICES NICELY .
      
      
      I ALREADY SEE THAT IN MANY FORUMS , THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED .
      
      
      CURRENTLY PHONE IS WORKING ONLY WITH 3G .
      
      
      MY SUGGESTION  : PHONE IS OK AT THIS PRICE POINT BUT IF YOU ARE TAKING FROM STORE , PLS ENSURE THAT WIFI IS WORKING ON THE PHONE ."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"SEEING AT THE COST OF PHONE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN A FLASH FOR THE CAMERA AND THEREFORE, IN MY VIEW IT IS NOT WORTH OF ITS COST.   NOKIA SHOULD BROUGHT AN UPGRADED VERSION OF THIS PHONE CONTAINING FLASH."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"SIR THIS IS A NEEDFUL AND PURPOSEFUL FEEDBACK FROM A TRUE LOVER OF LUMIA MOBILES. NOW THERE IS CRAZE GOING OVER NOKIA LUMIA MOBILES , BECAUSE IT HAS WINDOWS 8 OS.  ACCORDING TO A COMMON MAN WITH MINIMAL KNOWLEDGE ON MOBILES MOST OF US ARE NOW NOW INTERESTED IN BUYING LUMIA MOBILES.  KINDLY REMEBER MOST OF THESE PEOPLE WILL BELONG TO THE AGE GROU OF 20- 30 YEARS. BUT  THE REAL PROBLEM IS: -- - - -  WINDOWS PHONE IS NOT UPTO THE MARK.  IT IS MUCH LESS COMPARED TO SYMBIAN OS. TELEVISION ADDS ARE MAINLY CONCENTRATED ON ITS SPEED, AND CAMERA.  BUT SIR WHERE ARE APPS.  I AM AFRAID IF THE SAME CONTINUES THE SAME SUPPORT FOR LUMIA MOBILES YOU MAY FACE HUGE LOSES. BECAUSE THIS IS MY PERSONAL EXPERIANCE.I THOUGHT SO MUCH FOR LUMIA 520, BUT UTTTTERELY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I BOUGHT IT. TOTALLY LIKE A DUST BIN.
      
      1. NO GMAIL APP ---   THE NORMAL MAIL INBUILT IN PHONE ONLY PROVIDES RECENT MAILS. THEN WHAT ABOUT THE PAST MAILS. WHERE SHOULD WE GO.
      
      2. WE CHAT AND WHATS APP DONOT RUN IN BACK GOUND. THEN WHAT IS THE MEANING IN USING IT.
      
      3. THOUGH I HAVE 3G STILL NET SPEED IS SLOW. SO MAY IT BE THE PROBLEM WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS,  ""BUT SIR WHATS APP AND WE CHAT ARE NOT WORKING WITH MOBILE DATA. "".  WHAT IS THE USE IN USING THEM THEN.
      
      4.NO APPS , I THINK NOKIA MUST DEVELOPE IN BUILDING APPS 600%, ONCE AGAIN REPEATING IT YOUUUU MUST PROVIDE APPS, TRUE COMPANY APPS AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVE. I THINK YOUR APP STORE IS A ""DUSTBIN"" WITH 99% USELESS APPS. I THINK NOKIA HAS NO INTEREST AND KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THEM. PLEASE CHANGE  YOUR ATTITUDE OVER IT.
      
      5. I AM TRUELY REPENTING OVER BUYING THIS MOBILE ""LUMIA 520"". ONE OF THE WORST MOBILES I HAVE EVER BOUGHT.
      
      6. MY FINAL WORD "" IF NOKIA WANNA IMPROVE YOUR SALES, TRY THESE IMPROVEMENTS, OR I AM AFRAID YOU MAY FACE HUGE PROBLEMS WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT LUMIA .
      
      7. WE USE THE BLEADY CAMERA ONLY ONCE IN A DAY, BUT WE ALMOST AND ALWAYS USE APPS . KINDLY CONCENTRATE ON IT
      
      8. ITS SHAME ON YOUR PART THAT WINDOWS PHONE DOES NOT HAVE GMAIL APP.
      
      9. THE WORST PART OF LUMIA IS THE BROWSER. ONE OF THE WASTE AND WORST BROWSERS I HAVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE. FULLY FALTUUU BROWERS IN STORE. WASTE. WINDOWS 98 HAS A BETTER BROWSER. AND NO BROWSERS APPS IN THE STORE ATLEAST TO DOWNLOAD. SHAME,  NO CHROME OR AT LEAST FIREFOX OR OPERA.
      
      10. WITH ALL THESE WHAT IS THE USE OF A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR. USE LESS NOKIA IS PLAYING GAMES WITH PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND UNDERSTANDING.
      
      
      //// FINALLY MY VERDICT ---  SYMBIAN OS IS MUCH BETTER THAN WINDOWS 8.  IF YOU REALLY WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE FRUITS OF TECHNOLOGY ..  GO FOR ANDROID ////
      
      //// IF YOU DONOT DEVELOPE APPS YOU GONNA FACE HUGE PROBLEMS///
      
      /// WINDOWS SUCKS ! LUMIA SUCKS!   ////"
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"THE HARDWARE PROVIDED BY NOKIA IS NO DOUBT GOOD BUT SOFTWARE IS UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX AND NOT USER FRIENDLY UNLIKE ANDROID. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN'T CHECK CALL DURATION AFTER DISCONNECTING THE CALL IN HISTORY. SAME VOLUME CONTROL FOR MEDIA AND RINGTONE :-@.
      
      
      COME ON MS WHAT DID YOU THINK WHILE DESIGNING THIS OS
      
      YOU'LL BE AMAZED THAT I'VE WORKED FOR MICROSOFT OS TEAM FOR 4 YEARS AND STILL FOUND IT VERY LESS USER FRIENDLY.

      CONSIDERING THESE LIMITATIONS THIS IT SHOULD HAVE LOWER PRICE OR THESE SOME OTHER MOBILE WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS SHOULD BE LOOKED AT,"
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"UNFORTUNATELY I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE,IT HAS A LOT OF GOOD AND BAD POINTS SEE THE FOLLOWING
      
      PROS:
      
      DISPLAY:DISPLAY IS SO GOOD
      
      TOUCH:TOUCH IS SMOOTHER THAN ANDROID.
      
      VIDEO:VIDEO QUALITY IS GOOD FOR WATCHING HD MOVIES
      
      CAMERA:AVERAGE
      
      BATTERY :AVERAGE
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1.DON'T HAVE FILE MANAGER.
      
      2.AUDIO QUALITY IS  WORSSTTTTTTTTT,WHEN GOING TO SETTINGS FOR AUDIO THERE IS NOTHING TO DISPLAY
      
      3.NO GRAPHIC EQUALIZER FOR AUDIO
      
      4.THE MOBILE HAS SERIOUS HEATING ISSUE
      
      5.NO ANY GOOD APPS,MOST OF THE APPS ARE WORST AS COMPARED TO ANDROID
      
      6.NO GTALK,SKYPE..NO ANY GOOGLE PRODUCTS.SKYPE DOES NOT WORK
      
      7.CAMERA AND SOUND BUTTON DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY,
      
      8.BLUETOOTH TRANSFER FOR IMAGE AND MP3 IS NOT POSSIBLE
      
      9.IT HAS A SERIOUS HEATING ISSUE
      
      10.NO ANY GOOD APPS.ALL APPS ARE PAID ,MOST OF THEM ARE WORST AS COMPARED TO ANDORID
      
      11.INTERNET EXPLORER HAS NOT FORWARD/BACKWARD BUTTON
      
      12.NO SEPRATE BUTTON FOR CONTROLLING RINGTONE VOLUME AND MUSIC VOLUME
      
      
      13. AND A LOT OF ISSUES ARE GETTING EVERY DAY.....
      
      
      THESE ARE THE REASON WHY NOKIA IS FALLING DOWN IN THE MARKET WHILE ANDROID RULES THE SMARTPHONE MARKET.I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE FOR RS.9500 FROM THE SHOP."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"UNFORTUNATELY, COULD NOT BUY THE PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART AT LAUNCH AS I GOT A FREE 16GB SD MICRO CARD FREE INSTEAD OF 8GB FROM ANOTHER SITE. SORRY FLIPKART...
      
      
      EXTERNAL LOOK AND FEEL OF THE PHONE IS DECENT FOR THE PRICE. THE BIGGEST PRO OF THIS PHONE IS THE ULTRA-SHARP 4"" SCREEN(BETTER THAN LUMIA 720 IN PPI). THE MATT BACK PANEL IS KIND OF SLIPPERY TO TOUCH AND HENCE SUGGEST USING A SILICONE CASE. AS USUAL, THE WINDOWS 8 IS SUPER RESPONSIVE AND FLUID. THE BACK BUTTON IS UN RESPONSIVE AT TIMES. THE LIVE MESSENGER DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE SO INSTEAD, TRY SKYPE/WHATS APP, ETC.
      
      
      THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF GOOD FREE APPS IN THE MARKET, INCLUDING THOSE FROM MICROSOFT &AMP; NOKIA, SO NOT VERY DISAPPOINTED.
      
      
      PHOTO QUALITY IN AMPLY LIT AMBIANCE IS DECENT BUT SUFFERS IN DARKER SETTINGS AS THE CAMERA HAS NO FLASH (I CAN LIVE WITH THIS FOR THE PRICE I'VE PAID).
      
      
      THE VOLUME, POWER AND CAMERA BUTTONS ARE NOT SO CONVENIENT TO OPERATE AS THEY ARE PLACED ON A BACKWARD/INWARD TAPERING EDGE OF THE BACK PLATE. FEEL OF THE BUTTONS ARE FLIMSY AND CAN GET STUCK IF YOU DO NOT LOCK THE BACK PLATE PROPERLY AFTER REMOVING IT.
      
      
      I HAVE 3 MAJOR SOUR POINTS WITH THIS PHONE AND REQUEST NOKIA TO ADDRESS IT AT THE EARLIEST THROUGH SOFTWARE UPDATE(S).
      
      
      1) THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS RELATED TO SAFETY AND HAS TO DO WITH HEATING UP OF THE BACK PANEL AREA ABOVE THE CAMERA WHEN THE PHONE IS USED OUTDOOR. THIS MOSTLY HAPPENS WHEN ONE IS SIMPLY CHATTING USING ""WHATS APP"" DURING TRAVELING AND GIVES YOU THE FEELING THAT THE PHONE COULD ""EXPLODE"" ANY MOMENT DUE TO THE HEAT. IT APPEARS THAT NOKIA HAS TAKEN SERIOUS SHORT CUTS IN DESIGN/MATERIAL OF CONSTRUCTION TO MAKE IT CHEAP.
      
      
      2) NOKIA MUSIC IS AN UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT DUE TO UNAVAILABILITY OF EVEN A SINGLE AUDIO ENHANCEMENT SETTING, WHICH IS OTHERWISE AVAILABLE IN STOCK WINDOWS 8 SOFTWARE PROVIDED BY MICROSOFT. THIS IS A BIG BUMMER. SONGS SOUND FLAT, UN TASTEFUL WHEN EVEN PLAYED THROUGH MY BOSE QC 15 NOISE CANCELLATION HEADPHONE. THIS IS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME, AN AUDIOPHILE. NOKIA HAS PURPOSELY DELETED THIS SETTING IN ORDER TO REDUCE BATTERY DRAIN OR ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON THE CPU.
      
      
      3) BATTERY BACKUP BARELY LASTS FOR A DAY'S WORK (MODERATE USE WITH 3G DATA)WITH BATTERY SAVER OPTION TURNED ON. THIS BATTERY SAVING MODE TRUNCATES VISUAL PERFORMANCE AND SWITCHES OFF DATA ONCE SCREEN IS TURNED OFF THEREBY NO EXCHANGE OF DATA TILL YOU SWITCH ON THE SCREEN AGAIN. DUE TO THIS, MAILS, CHAT AND DATA DEPENDENT APPS DO NOT WORK IN BATTERY SAVER OPTION TILL THE SCREEN IS TURNED ON.
      
      
      IF THE ABOVE 3 ISSUES DO NOT MATTER TO YOU, THIS IS THE RIGHT PHONE FOR THE FEATURES AND PRICE."
Nokia Lumia 520,2,"WELL IF YOU INQUIRE A LITTLE ABOUT THIS PHONE, YOU'L REALIZE THAT IT IS PACKED WITH AMAZING SPECKS AT A PRETTY AFFORDABLE PRICE AND THE DEAL MIGHT JUST SOUND A STEAL.
      
      
      BUT WAIT.. HAVING USED THIS PHONE PERSONALLY FOR OVER A WEEK I CAN TELL YOU THINGS BEYOND THE FLASHY SPECKS. THE PHONE JUST LOOKS TOO DAMN BEAUTIFUL, AND THE WIN 8 DOES GIVE A PRETTY GOOD FEEL ALONG WITH IT. HARDWARE TOO IS PRETTY ROBUST AND STRONG ENOUGH TO RUN THE OS SMOOTHLY. ALSO THERE ARE SOME PRETTY COOL AND CONVENIENT FEATURES PACKED ALONG TO MAKE IT  A GOOD DEAL ALTOGETHER.
      
      
      BUT IT SEEMS NOKIA FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON FLASHY FEATURES TO FORGET ABOUT SOME BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF A PHONE. HERE ARE SOME OF THEM:
      
      
      A, THE DAMN PHONE DOESNT COME ALONG WITH AN INBUILT FILE MANAGER AND NEITHER IS THERE ONE GOOD ENOUGH AVAILABLE IN THE WIN APP MARKET. THIS MEANS YOU CANNOT DIRECTLY BROWSE THE CONTENTS OF YOUR PHONE OR SD CARD..
      
      
      B. HAVING BUILT WITH DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, 512 MB RAM AND WHATNOT. THE PHONE STILL DOESN'T SUPPORT BASIC GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN. THE WIN MARKET IS ALREADY DEVOID OF MANY USEFUL APPS AND THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF THIS PHONE NARROWS THAT DOWN EVEN FURTHER
      
      
      C. ALTHOUGH IT'S PACKED WITH A 5MP CAMERA, THE IMAGE QUALITY IS STILL JUST NOT THAT GOOD.
      
      
      D. THE PHONE COMES WITH A PRETTY LAME DEFAULT MUSIC PLAYER WHICH LACKS BASIC FACILITIES LIKE SEARCHING FOR A SONG OR QUEUING THEM UP OR HAVING AN EQUALIZER AND MANY MORE SUCH BASIC THINGS. NOR IS THERE ANY GOOD COMPATIBLE MUSIC PLAYER AVAILABLE ON WINDOWS MARKET.
      
      
      E. THE BLUETOOTH SHARING SERVICE OF THIS PHONE JUST SUCKS TO THE CORE.. DUE TO THE MISSING FILE MANAGER, THERE IS JUST NO WAY BY WHICH YOU COULD SEND STUFF FROM YOUR SD CARD OR PHONE TO ANOTHER VIA BLUETOOTH. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN RECEIVE ANYTHING FROM OTHERS PHONE BUT YOU SIMPLY CAN'T SHARE ANYTHING FROM YOURS.
      
      
      SO IN SHORT THE PHONE IS JUST PACKED WITH BIG FLASHY FEATURES BUT LACKS SOME OF THE MOST BASIC COMMON ONES THAT ACTUALLY MAKE A SMARTPHONE ""SMART""."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"1. I BOUGHT A NOKIA 520 ON 7 MAY 2 IMEI : 355910056203491. CHALAN NO. 229/13-14.
      
      2. THE SET STARTED SHUTTING DOWN AND RESTARTING ON ITS OWN, QUITE A FEW TIMES, FOR NO APPARENT REASON. I RETURNED THE SET TO BHARAT ELECTRONIC TRADING CORP, WHICH SENT IT TO YOUR SALES OFFICE.
      
      3.I WAS GIVEN A REPLACEMENT AFTER 15 (FIFTEEN) DAYS, (IMEI  355910058922965),  BUT THE NEW SET COULD NOT REGISTER ANY  MEMORY CARD.
      
      4. I SET WAS SENT TO YOUR DELHI OFFICE VIA NOKIA SERVICE CENTRE HERE.
      
      5. AFTER A FORTNIGHT, I ISSUED ME THE REPAIRED SET.
      
      6. BUT THIS STARTED GIVING PROBLEMS ? NOW WITH THE VOLUME CONTROL SWITCH AND CAMERA SHORTCUT SWITCH. ON JULY 11, IT SHUT DOWN ON ITS OWN AND HAS BEEN DEAD SINCE THEN.
      
      I AM A NOKIA FAN, DO NOT WISH TO GO FOR FOR OTHER MAKES NOW....."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"1. POOR FITMENT - CHECK FROM THE ROCKER SIDE BUTTON YOU FEEL SOME KIND OF LOOSE COVER.
      
      
      2. SINCE THIS HANDSET HAS 1 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR WITH 302 GPU EVEN THEN THIS HANDSET IS NOT ABLE TO HANDLE MULTITASKING (I AM TALKING HERE TWO APPLICATION IN A SINGLE TIME AND PROCESSOR GETTING STUCK AND GIVING ME POOR RESPONSE)
      
      
      3. NO LIGHT UNDER THE CAPACITOR TOUCH (WINDOWS KEYS) WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE SMART PHONES."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"10 DAYS AGO I BOUGHT IT FOR 10K. ITS TOUCH IS PATHETIC.
      
      APPLICATIONS ARE NOT RESPONDING WELL.
      
      WINDOWS CAN NEVER BEAT ANDROID SYSTEMS..
      
      MANY GAMES ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY WINDOWS"
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"ALL SAID &AMP; DONE ABOUT THE LUMIA 520.. BUT WHEN WILL THEY DELIVER IT??? I STAY VERY NEAR TO THE DELIVERY HUB AND I AM THE ONE WHO PRE-ORDERED 2 PHONES ON 3-APR, PHONE GOT RELEASED ON 6-APR AND STILL I HAVE NOT GOT MY PHONES.
      
      
      IT'S A FALSE PROMISE FROM FLIPKART TO ITS CUSTOMER DELIVERY WITHIN 2-3 BUSINESS DAYS."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"AS I WAS A SYMBIAN USER FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS I REGRET BUYING THIS WINDOWS PHONE
      
      IT IS MISSING MANY FEATURES TO QUALIFY AS A CELL PHONE
      
      CONS:
      
      1) NO PROFILE SETUP. YOU CAN NOT MAKE YOUR PHONE TO ALERT FOR A PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE. ALL CREDIT CARD AGENTS, LOAN AGENTS, ETC CAN WAKE YOU UP ANYTIME!
      
      2) NO ASCENDING, BEEP ONCE ETC. IN THE RING OPTION
      
      3) VIBRATE, SILENT AND RING ARE AVAILABLE BUT NAVIGATING BETWEEN THOSE OPTIONS IS PATHETIC
      
      4) DIFFERENT VOLUME CONTROLS FOR SMS, VOICE CALL, SONGS PLAYBACK, RINGING ARE NOT AVAILABLE.
      
      5) BACK BUTTON IS THE ONLY WAY TO CLOSE THE APPS
      
      6) BACK AND START KEY VIBRATION CAN NOT BE CONTROLLED. REALLY ANNOYING
      
      7) BATTERY BACK UP IS NOT GREAT. FOR A NORMAL USING, IT COMES FOR 30HRS WHICH INCLUDES JUST ~1HR TALK TIME
      
      8) IN MESSAGING YOU CAN NOT CREATE FOLDERS IN CASE YOU WANT TO SEGREGATE THE MESSAGES
      
      9) SMS DELIVERY REPORT WILL NOT DISPLAY THE CONTACT NAME RATHER IT SHOWS THE CONTACT NUMBER. I HAVE 1000  CONTACTS STORED, IS IT POSSIBLE TO MEMORIZE ALL THE NUMBERS.
      
      SYMBIAN USERS AND PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A MOBILE WITH PHONE FEATURES PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"BEFORE I TELL YOU WHY I DON'T RECOMMEND WINDOWS PHONE, I MUST TELL YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN USING LUMIA 520 FOR LAST 45 DAYS. PHONE IS QUITE GOOD IN ALL ASPECTS BE IT CALL QUALITY, BE IT UI . DISPLAY IS SUPER GOOD AND TOUCHSCREEN IS AWESOME. PEOPLE KEEP ON COMPLAINING ABOUT APPS, BUT TRUST ME WE HAVE ALL THE USEFUL APPS IN WINDOWS PHONE WHICH WE NEED FOR DAILY USE. SOME ARE EVEN BETTER THAN ANDROID. SO THESE ARE THE BEST PARTS OF MY REVIEW. BY THIS TIME I AM SURE, YOU MUST HAVE READ THE REVIEW TITLE ATLEAST 2 TIMES THAT WHY I DON'T RECOMMEND WINDOWS PHONE.
      
      SO HERE IT GOES. LUMIA HAS 7.1 GB INTERNAL MEMORY IN WHICH WE CAN INSTALL APPS. MIND THAT, WE CAN INSTALL APPS ONLY IN INTERNAL MEMORY NOT ON SD CARD. OUT OF 7.1 GB, 4 GB IS USER ACCESSIBLE WHICH IS QUITE ENOUGH FOR INSTALLING APPS. ASSUMING THAT AN AVERAGE APP TAKES UP 20 MB OF SPACE, WE CAN INSTALL 200 APPS. EVEN THE MOST ADDICTED PHONE USERS DONT NEED THAT MANY APPS , SO MEMORY IS NOT A PROBLEM. BUT WAIT. WHEN WE SEE THE BREAKUP OF THE MEMORY, IT IS DIVIDED INTO 4 SECTIONS.
      
      1.APPS
      
      2.SYSTEM
      
      3. MUSIC ,PHOTOS AND ALL
      
      4. OTHERS.
      
      
      THE FOURTH SECTION 'OTHERS' IS INACCESSIBLE BY USERS AND WE CANT DELETE ANYTHING IN THAT. WHEN YOU PURCHASE A NEW PHONE , THE SIZE IS AROUND 50 MB. BUT AS YOU KEEP ON USING IT , ITS SIZE WILL GROW BIGGER AND BIGGER. IT IS LIKE THE %TEMP% FOLDER IN OUR COMPUTER WHICH KEEPS SOME RANDOM DATA. AND IS OF NO USE TO US. I WILL GIVE AN EXAMPLE HOW THIS MEMORY GETS CONSUMED.
      
      ASSUME YOU HAVE 500 MB OF MEMORY LEFT IN YOUR PHONE. YOU INSTALL AN APP OF 30 MB. REMAINING IS 470 MB. BUT YOU WILL GET ONLY 465 MB. THIS EXTRA 5 MB GOT CONSUMED IN OTHER SECTION. NOW YOU UNINSTALL THE APP. YOU SHOULD GET 495 MB. BUT YOU WILL GET ONLY 490 MB. SO, THERE IS EFFECTIVELY NO CHANGE IN THE CONTENTS OF PHONE BECAUSE YOU INSTALLED AND UNINSTALLED AN APP AND NET IS ZERO. BUT WHAT WE LOST IS 10 MB WITHOUT ANY REASON. THIS KIND OF MEMORY CONSUMPTION WILL HAPPEN EVERY TIME WHATEVER YOU DO IN YOUR PHONE. SO , RIGHT NOW IN MY PHONE , THE 'OTHER' SECTION IS CONSUMING AS MUCH AS 2.6 GB OF SPACE WITHOUT ANY REASON. AND YOU CAN NOT DELETE IT. NOW IF I WATCH ANY YOUTUBE VIDEO OR ANYTHING WHICH REQUIRES PHONE SPACE, IT SAYS THAT YOUR PHONE MEMORY IS LOW. AND THIS CONSUMPTION WILL KEEP ON INCREASING. I CHECKED WINDOWS FORUM AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE FACING THIS PROBLEM. I WILL HAVE TO RESET THE PHONE IF I WANT TO DELETE THAT OTHERS SECTION. YOU WILL LOSE ALL DATA IN YOUR PHONE IF YOU DO THAT.
      
      SO GUYS, INITIAL EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE AWESOME WITH WINDOWS PHONE , BUT TRUST ME , AFTER 50 -60 DAYS , YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN THE SAME SITUATION AS I AM IN RIGHT NOW.
      
      REST IS YOUR CHOICE."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"CONS:
      
      1. BATTERY BACK UP IS VERY POOR. POWER REMAINS FOR ONLY 2-3 HOURS AFTER CHARGING. THIS IS THE MOST SERIOUS ISSUE IN THIS PHONE.
      
      2. THIS CELLPHONE HEATS UP DURING CHARGING AND AT THE TIME OF 3G USES.
      
      3. CAMERA FLASH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS PHONE.
      
      4. F.M. RADIO IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS PHONE.
      
      5. CALL RECORDING IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THIS PHONE.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. TOUCH RESPONSE IS GOOD.
      
      2. STYLISH LOOK."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"DEAR BLIND BUYERS..
      
      
      HOW WILL U MANAGE FILES IN WINDOWS PHONE 8 AS THERE IS NO FILE MANAGER IN THIS PHONE NOR IN WINDOWS STORE...
      
      THERE IS ALSO NO FM RADIO, CALL BLOCKER ETC
      
      EVEN WHATSAPP HANGS IN WINDOWS PHONE...
      
      DON'T PRAISE LUMIA 520 AS MICROSOFT IS EXPERT IN FOOLING CONSUMERS
      
      MANY ESSENTIAL FEATURES ARE MISSING IN WINDOWS PHONE..
      
      THIS PHONE SHOULD HAVE RATED NEGATIVE AS MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF FILE MANAGER IS MISSING IN THIS PHONE, MY 10K BUCKS HAS BEEN WASTED. I SHOULD HAVE OPTED FOR ANDROID.
      
      NO ONE NOTICED THIS BIG FAULT IN LUMIA SERIES"
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"DON'T BUY WINDOWS PHONE, OF ANY COMPANY. WINDOWS 8 OS STILL NEED TO IMPROVE A LOT. IT IS VERY FAST, GOOD DISPLAY ETC.. BUT WINDOWS MOBILE OS IS NOT AT ALL USER FRIENDLY. SYMBIAN EVEN JAVA BASED PHONES ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS PHONE'S INTERFACE. THE MAIN DRAWBACK IS NO FILE MANAGER FOR FILE SHARING WITH LAPTOP YOU NEED TO USE SKYDRIVE, YOU WILL NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR FILES ..IT WILL BE STORED IN SINGLE DRIVE. YOU CAN'T EVEN MANAGE YOUR DATA WITH SD CARD. YESTERDAY I RECD THIS PHONE AND ITS WORK LIKE CRAZY. MOST OF THE APPLICATION AND GAMES WERE PAID. ATTACHING FILES TO EMAIL IS ANOTHER ISSUE. EARPHONE WITH NOKIA LUMIA 520 IS WORST THEN MICROMAX EARPHONE, CHEAP QUALITY IT WILL PAIN YOUR EARS AFTER 1 HOUR OF USE. CAMERA ONLY WORKS WELL IN LIGHT NOT EVEN GOOD AS COMPARED TO N OR E SERIES NOKIA PHONES. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE THE FEEDBACK OF WINDOWS OS, SEE IT IN WINDOWSPHONE USERVOICE OR IN OR IN ANY DISCUSSION FORUMN"
Nokia Lumia 520,1,EVERYBODY EVERYWHERE TALKS ABOUT SOFTWARE BUT KEY HARDWARE OPTIMIZATION MISSES.AS WINDOWS8 BEING COMMERCIAL O.S THIS BAKWAS NOKIA INSTALLED JUST SO AS TO SCREW. FOR EVERY SMALL CHANGE OF HARDWARE O.S SAYS NOT GENUINE EVEN THERE SERVICE CENTRE GUYS DOESN' KNOW ANYTHING SO THEY SENT TO COMPANY WHICH TAKES ALMOST 30DAYS FOR TRAVELL. DON'T BUY... IT'S GOOD TILL THERE IS NO PROBLEM BUT THEN CUSTOMER GETS ON BANGED.........
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"FIRST TIME I FACE SUCH A BITTER EXPERIENCE FROM FLIPKART. IN FACT I ORDERED THE PRODUCT THROUGH FLIPKART ON 28TH OF JUNE'13 AND TO EXPECT THE SHIPMENT BY 02ND OF JULY'13. BUT WHEN I CONTACT THEM THROUGH PHONE, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE COULDN'T GIVE ANY VALID REASON AND JUST INFORMING THAT THEY HAD TO RECEIVE THE SHIPMENT BACK AND AGAIN RESEND. IT IS QUITE EMBARRASSING THAT FLIPKART CANT DELIVER THE PRODUCT WITH IN 1 WEEK THOUGH THEY COMMITTED IN THREE DAYS. I WONDER WHY THEY COMMIT SUCH PERIOD OF DELIVERY IF THEY CANT DELIVER IT BY THEN..............ALSO AM WAITING FOR THE PRODUCT AND DELIVERY EXPECTED BY 09TH OF JULY."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"GOT THE PHONE ON 30TH APRIL. FROM 1ST MAY I NOTICED SOME NETWORK DROP. AND THE PROBLEM KEPT ON INCREASING. AT TIMES IT SHOWS NETWORK BAR BUT WHO EVER CALLS ME GET NOT REACHABLE MESSAGE. THIS HAPPENS FREQUENTLY. IT ALSO RESTART AT TIMES AUTOMATICALLY.
      
      
      I DECIDED TO GO TO NOKIA CARE. THEY REINSTALLED FARMWARE AND GAVE ME THE PHONE TODAY SAYING ITS ALRIGHT. SINCE THEN THE PHONE IS RESTARTING EVERY 15-20 MINUTES. NOW NOKIA IS SAYING THEY WILL KEEP THE PHONE UNDER OBSERVATION FOR FEW DAYS AND THEN DECIDE WHAT TO DO.. RIDICULOUS...
      
      MY FIRST AND LAST NOKIA PHONE.."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"HI ALL,
      
      
      MY FIRST REVIEW TO HELP YOU ALL TO TAKE A DECISION.
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE LAST WEEK. ONLY AFTER 2 DAYS... I WAS IN OFFICE AND WAS TRYING TO CONNECT TO WI-FI. SOMEHOW IT KEPT ON SAYING ME THAT ITS WRONG USERID/PASSWORD (COMMON, IT WAS CORRECT), OKAY, I DECIDED THAT I SHOULD RE-START THE PHONE, MAY BE IT WILL HELP. AND THATS IT, THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW THOSE NICE LOOKING WIN8 STUFF. IT GOT SWITCHED OFF SMOOTHLY, BUT DID NOT TURN ON EVER. IT SHOWED ME A BLUE SCREEN. YES, A BLUE SCREEN AND NOTHING ELSE.
      
      
      I COULD DO NOTHING BUT TO TAKE IT TO NOKIA CARE WHERE THEY CHECKED HARDWARE AND SAID ""ALL FINE"". THEN THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG AND IT NEEDS TO BE SENT TO DELHI TO GET IT FIXED.
      
      
      THANKS TO FLIPKART, WHEN I CALLED FLIPKART TEAM, THEY ASKED ME TO RETURN IT.
      
      
      SO PEOPLE I REALLY LIKED THE PHONE, BUT DONT KNOW HOW I COULD SAY THAT ITS A GOOD PHONE WHEN IT DID NOT EVEN WORK FOR 2 DAYS....
      
      
      I AM HOPING THAT IT WAS ONLY ME WHO WAS UN-LUCKY TO HAVE A DEFECTIVE PIECE. IF THAT IS PROVED I WONT MIND ORDERING ANOTHER OF SAME MODEL, BUT SURELY ONLY FROM FLIPKART :-)"
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"HOW CAN I WRITE A REVIEW WITHOUT GETTING THE PRODUCT IN MY HAND?????I WAS REALLY UPSET WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY FLIPKART....IT WAS SUCH A BAD EXPERIENCE I HAV EVER FACED IN MY LIFE...EVEN IT WAS TOTALLY A BLACK MARK TO THE COMPLETE ONLINE PURCHASE MARKET....
      
      THE STORY GOES LIKE THIS.....PURCHASED LUMICA 520 ON THE 3RD OF THIS MONTH...FLIPKART SENT A DAMAGED ITEM...INFORMED FLIPKART ABOUT THIS AND THEY ASKED ME TO RETURN BACK TO THE ADDRESS THEY PROVIDED. I DID IT. SURPRISINGLY THEY HAD REJECTED THE ITEM FRM THE COURIER SERVICE. COURIER PEOPLE RETURNED BACK TO MY ADDRESS....TILL NOW THIS PRODUCT HAS NOT REACHED MY HANDS....
      
      I CONTACTED THEIR CUSTOMER CARE ALMOST 25 TIMES....NO ACTION BEEN TAKEN TILL DATE...I ASKED THEM TO CANCEL MY ORDER...FLIPKART NOT READY TO DO TAT ASWELLL...
      
      YOU MAY PLS GO AND CHECK THE EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE BTW MYSELF N FLIPKART....IT WAS LITERALLY WASTE OF TIME ORDERING FRM FLIPKART...."

Nokia Lumia 520,1,"I BOUGHT IT ONE THE FIRST DAY OF LAUNCH.
      
      IT HEATS UP LIKE HELL IN 5 MINUTES OF INTERNET USAGE, SO MUCH THAT I CAN'T EVEN HOLD THE PHONE.
      
      BATTERY IS THE WORSE I HAVE EXPERIENCED.
      
      I AM USING MY OLD ANDROID PHONE NOW."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"I BOUGHT LUMIA 520 AND I HAVE RECIEVED A DEFECTIVE PIECE - CAMERA BUTTON DOESN'T WORK.TALKED TO NOKIA CARE, OMG THEIR RESPONSE HAS BEEN PATHETIC, AND EVERY ONE USE THE EVERY OTHER EXCUSE TO AVOID A REPLACEMENT. LUCKILY I BOUGHT THROUGH FLIPKART, AND TRUST ME THEY ARE THE BEST - NO FUSS, NO FRILLS ATTACHED; THEY JUST PROCESSED THE REPLACEMENT. I WISH THEY WOULD GIVE ME AN OPTION TO BUY ANY THING OTHER THAN NOKIA.
      
      
      EVERY ONE SAY THAT NOKIA IS SLOW DEATH, BUT WITH THEIR WAYS INDICATE THAT THEY ARE ON A SUICIDE MISSION.
      
      
      5 STARS FOR FLIPKART AND ZERO FOR NOKIA.
      
      
      DO NOT BUY A NOKIA, HOWEVER GREAT THEIR PRODUCTS MAY BE; AFTER SALES SUPPORT IS THE WORST IN THE WORLD."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"I BROUGHT THIS MUCH HYPED PHONE SOMETIME BACK. WAS VERY HAPPY TO USE IT UNTIL NEXT DAY WHEN IT GOT SWITCHED OFF PERMANENTLY AND NEVER WORKED AGAIN FOR ME. TRIED WITH CHARGING AND THE FIRST AID TIPS PRESENT IN WINDOWS/NOKIA SITE, NOTHING HELPED SO I CALLED FLIPKART AND THEY ARRANGED THE REPLACEMENT WITHOUT ANY ARGUMENTS. SO I WAS HAPPY AGAIN TO GET THE SAME PHONE BACK AFTER 3 DAYS. I WAS USING IT AND FINDING IT NICE UNTIL I PLUGGED IN THE EAR PHONES, I REALIZED THAT THERE IS NO SOUND IN ONE SPEAKER AND ONLY ONE IS WORKING WHEN EARPHONES ARE COMPLETELY PLUGGED IN.
      
      THIS WAS DISGUSTING AND I CALLED FLIPKART AGAIN, DETAILED THEM THE PROBLEM AND THIS TIME THEY ARRANGED FOR MONEY BACK WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.
      
      
      BUT BOTH THE SETS I USED WERE DEFECTIVE FROM NOKIA ITSELF. BOTH WERE SEALED WHEN I GOT THEM, SO NO COMPLAINTS TO FLIPKART BUT NOKIA SUCKS!!"
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"I LIKE THIS PHONE VERY MUCH,,U CAN'T GET ANY PHONE LIKE THIS WITHIN THIS PRICE RANGE...BUT ITS BATTERY BACKUP IS HORRIBLE,,,IF U BUY THIS PHONE U WILL HAVE TO CHARGE THIS ATLEAST 3 TIMES A DAY....OTHERWISE ITS NICE...."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"I ORDERED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART AND GOT DELIVERED IN 3 DAYS, HATS OFF TO THIR SERVICE, BUT NOKIA NEEDS TO PUT EXTRA EFFORTS ON THE QUALITY OF THE PHONE,
      
      1. THE PHONE CAMERA BUTTON ON THE SIDE PANEL DOES NOT WORK, SO I HAVE ASKED TO REFUND MY MONEY AND THEY HAVE ENSURED THAT, SOME ONE WILL BE THERE TO TAKE THE MOBILE BACK.
      
      2. THE DISPLAY OF THE PHONE SHOWS SOME TRUNCATION OF THE ANOTHER TAB IN THE QUEQUE.
      
      3. NO SCREEN GUARD FOR THE MOBILE FROM THE NOKIA.
      
      MICRO SIM IS ANOTHER ISSUE."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE ON 29TH JUN 2013 AND JUST AFTER TWO DAYS CAME TO KNOW THAT IT IS GETTING HANG FOR ALL ITS FUNCTIONALITY EXCEPT CALL AND SMS, MOST IMPORTANT ITS CAMERA BUTTON ALSO NOT WORKING. RIGHT NOW NOW MY PHONE IS WITH NOKIA CARE FOR SERVICE SINCE 15 DAYS.
      
      
      VERY BAD CELL NOKIA LAUNCHED AND ALSO THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"I WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN MY FATHER GIFTED ME NOKIA LUMIA 520 A MONTH AGO ON MY BIRTHDAY.
      
      BUT ALL MY HAPPINESS GOES IN TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN IT WAS HANGED AFTER 10 DAYS.
      
      
      FROM THAT DAY PROBLEMS STARTED IN THIS PHONE..
      
      
      SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT I FACED IN THIS PHOME...
      
      
      1. A VIRUS ATTACKED WHEN I WAS USING INTERNET IN THIS PHONE..AFTER SWITCHING THE PHONE OFF THIS PROBLEM WAS SOLVED.
      
      
      2. TOUCH WAS AVERAGE FOR FEW DAYS BUT NOW ITS CREATES PROBLEMS IN SCROLLING MENU ITEMS...IT DOES NOT RESPONDS WELL.. IT IS WORKING NOW ONLY WITH HARD PRESSURE ON THE SCREEN..
      
      
      3. CAMERA IS NOT REAL 5 MEGAPIXEL. IT CAN CAPTURE GOOD PHOTOS ONLY IN BRIGHT DAY LIGHT..YOU'LL PROBABLY GET BLURRY PHOTOS WHEN THERE ISN'T ENOUGH LIGHT..IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CAPTURE A PICTURE IN NIGHT OR IN LOW LIGHT AS IT HAS NO LED FLASH...VIDEO RECORDER IS NOT UP TO THE MARK.. VIDEO QUALITY IS POOR AND COLOUR CONTRASTS IS VERY BAD. IT DOSE'T HAS A FRONT FACING CAMERA FOR VIDEO CALLING..
      
      
      4 INTERNET BROWSING IS PATHETIC ON INTERNET EXPLORAR AS IT DOES'NT SUPPORT GOOGLE CHROME OR OPERA WEB BROWSERS..IT TAKES A LOT TIME TO OPEN A PAGE
      
      
      5.THERE IS NO SINGLE NOTIFICATION AREA AS IN ANDROID PHONES WHICH MAKES IT TOUGH TO READ A NOTIFICATION..
      
      
      6. MS WORD AND EXCEL ARE FAULTY IN THIS PHONE AND DOES'NT HAS FULL FUNCTIONALITY.
      
      
      7.VIDEO OF MKV AND MPEG ARE NOT PLAYED IN THIS PHONE.
      
      
      8. RAM IS ONLY 512 MB WHICH IS TOO LESS FOR POPULAR GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN AND OTHERS   WHICH NEED ATLEAST 1 GB (IE 1024MB) OF RAM.
      
      
      9. ON PLAYING A GAME IT HEATS QUICKLY..
      
      
      10. MOST OF THE POPULAR APPLICATIONS ARE TO BE BOUGHT FOR ATLEAST RS 50.. WHILE LAKHS OF APPS ARE FEE AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID PHONES..VERY FEW APPS ARE AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS WHICLE ANDROID HAS LAKHS OF APPS FOR FREE..
      
      
      11. IT DOES'NT HAS A FM.
      
      
      12. BATTERY CAPACITY IS LOW , IT DISCHARGES QUICKLY..ONLY 1430 MAH.
      
      
      13. MORE BASIC SCREEN LCD SCREENS IS GENERALLY NOT AS BRIGHT OR AS VIVID AS OLED
      
      
      14. LOW RESOLUTION SCREEN 800X480 WITH ONLY 233 PPI.
      
      
      15.AFTER A YEAR WINDOWS 8 WILL BE OUTDATED. TO USE WINDOWS 8.5 OR WINDOWS 9 YOU WIL HAVE TO BUY A NEW PHONE AS IT IS NOT UPGRADABLE... WHILE ANDROID SYSTEMS ARE UPDATED REGULARLY ON PHONE ITSELF.
      
      
      CHOOSE WISELY ... I WILL SUGGEST A ANDROID PHONES LIKE SUMSANG OR HTC OR KARBONN TITANIUM S1 OR MICROMAX CANVAS WHICH ARE FAR MORE BETTER THAN THIS PHONE..
      
      
      VERY POOR DELIVERY BY FLIPKART.. IT TAKES 8 DAYS TO DELIVER THIS PHONE AT MY ADRESS IN DELHI 110007.
      
      
      I CAN'T TELL ANY MORE BECAUSE IT'S YOUR MONEY YOU CAN WASTE OR UTILISE IT....."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"I WOULD LIKE TO WRITE THIS REVIEW AFTER USING NOKIA 520 FOR 6 MONTHS. IT HAS SOME SERIOUS DRAWBACKS-
      
      
      1) AWFUL SCREEN- THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS IS NOT AT ALL GOOD. SOME TIMES BECOMES MURKY. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SCREEN QUALITY. CONSIDERING 10000 RS PRICE POINT THE COMPETITORS ARE OFFERING BRIGHTER SCREEN WHY GO FOR THE SUBSTANDARD ONE. ALSO THE SCREEN SIZE IS SMALL.
      
      YOU WILL HAVE HARD TIME LIVING WITH THE SCREEN.
      
      
      2) SLOW PROCESSOR- ALTHOUGH THE WINDOWS OS IS FAST, IT NEEDS SOME MINIMUM PROCESSING POWER TO RUN WITHOUT LAG. I KNOW YOU WILL SAY, WINDOWS PHONE AND LAG? IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. BUT BELIEVE ME IT WILL SLOW DOWN SOME OF YOUR DAILY TASKS.
      
      
      3) NOKIA SERVICES-  NOKIA MUSIC LACKS FEATURES WHICH YOU WILL FIND IN OTHER ANDROID PHONES LIKE EQUALIZER, SKINS ETC... NOKIA MAPS IS GOOD BUT LACKS THE VERSATILITY OF GOOGLE MAPS.
      
      
      4) APPS- THERE IS STILL A BIG OF GAP IN THE NO. OF APPS FOR WINDOWS PHONES. WINDOWS PHONES STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HIGH QUALITY GAMES AND APPS AS YOU WOULD LIKE. STILL MORE APPS AND GAMES NEEDED TO BE ADDED TO THE MARKET PLACE. LIKE YOU HAVE AN APP FOR YOUR EVERY NEED IN GOOGLE PLAY STORE AND ITS WHOLE LOT MORE FUN. ALSO, THE PHONE BECOMES LAGGY WHILE PLAYING GAMES. NOT SO RESPONSIVE.
      
      
      SO, MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO STAY AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS PHONES FOR NOW. THERE IS STILL A LOT OF REFINEMENT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO WINDOWS OS. TILL THEN GET YOUR FIRST ANDROID. BELIEVE ME YOU WILL THANK ME LATER."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"IF YOU WANT TO MESSED UP YOUR LIFE THEN GO FOR WINDOWS 8 PHONE I THINK PEOPLE SAYING IT'S A GREAT PHONE EITHER UPGRADING FROM BASIC PHONE OR A HARDCORE FAN OF NOKIA OR MOST PROBABLY NOKIA OR MICROSOFT MARKETING PEOPLE AS MOST OF INDIANS ARE OR NEVER EXPERIENCED HIGH END ANDROID AND IPHONE.
      
      
      NO FILE MANAGER FOR WP8 PHONES AND MS SAYING IT'S FOR SECURITY HUH..NO NATIVE GMAIL APP AND YOUTUBE APP HAVING JUST A WRAPPER EXTENDING BROWSER. NO DATA LIMIT OPTION CONSUMES YOUR MOBILE DATA IN A FEW DAYS.NO ZIP FILE VIEWER
      
      YOU CAN'T INSTALL APPLICATION FROM SD CARD OR IF YOU DEVELOP AN APPLICATION AND WANT TEST ON YOUR DEVICE OR WANT TO USE PERSONALLY  THEN YOU NEED TO PURCHASE LICENSE AND SPEND LOT OF BUCKS
      
      AND LOT'S OF OTHER FEATURES WHICH I MISSED FROM MY GALAXY NEXUS AND IPHONE I DON'T THINK IT'S A SMARTPHONE IT'S A CRAP OS FROM MS..AFTER 1 WEEK OF USING I SWITCHED BACK TO MY GALAXY NEXUS AND FEELING HOMELY....GTH MISCROSOFT I HATE U.!!!
      
      IF SOME ONE WANT TO KNOW MORE PROBLEM ABOUT THIS WP8 OS THEN CALL ME ON 9542097247
      
      OR MAIL ME AT NEERAJ.MH99@GMAIL.COM, MY PROFESSION IS MOBILE DEVICE AND APP TESTING. DEVELOPMENT SO I KNOW IT BETTER AND I AM NOT GETTING ANY MONEY TO PROMOTION OR DEMOTION AND IF I AM WRITING SUCH A REVIEW THEN YOU ASSUME I AM REALLY FEELING GUILTY AFTER PURCHASING THIS DEVICE"
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"ISSUE IS THE STUPID WINDOWS OS.
      
      JUST 1 HOMESCREEN SO KEEP PINNING APPS TO THAT ONLY , SO STUPID.
      
      ITS APP STORE LACK SO MANY REQUIRED APPS
      
      WHATS APP DOES NOT GIVE YOU OPTION TO CHOOSE ANY AUDIO/VIDEO FROM MOBILE.
      
      IT DID NOT FIND ANY GOOD MUSIC PLAYER THAT WILL PLAY LOCAL SONGS WITH GOOD OPTIONS
      
      NOKIA MUSIC IS STUPID THERE IS NO EQUALIZER, FOLDER OPTION, SLEEP TIME ETC
      
      THERE IS NO FILE MANAGER NOT EVEN ON APP STORE (FREE).
      
      OH MAN, I BOUGHT 2 LUMIA 520 ON THE FIRST DAY OF ITS LAUNCH.
      
      THATS NOT IT .. THERE ARE LOT OF OTHER MISSING THINGS IN IT. I CAN WRITE...
      
      
      SO GUYS NEVER EVER BUY THIS STUPID WINDOWS 8 PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"IT IS THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER USED
      
      DONT BUY THIS PHONE
      
      NOT GOOD AS ANDROID PHONES
      
      STRONGLY ADVISED NOT TO BUY NOKIA LUMIA 520
      
      NO FM , NO LED FLASH  NO ANDROID
      
      WINDOWS 8 WILL BE OUTDATED IN  A YEAR...NO UPDATE LIKE IN ANDROIDS"
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"MY MOM BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 21 APRIL AND FELT BAD THAT IT LACKS SO MANY FEATURES WHEN COMPARED TO ANDROID AND ALSO A BASIC PHONE IN THE FIRST PLACE.THERE ARE NO CALL BLOCKING APPS,NO RADIO(IT SAY INTERNET RADIO BUT NONE OF THESE APPS WORK IN IT).PHONE START-UP TIME IS SO MUCH THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS STUCK AND HAD TO REBOOT IT.I THOUGHT THIS PHONE WAS EASY TO USE BUT LOOKS A BIT CONFUSING LIKE EMAIL,PHONE DIALER,RINGTONE AND EVEN FILE MANAGER IS NOT THERE IN THESE PHONES :("
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"NO SECURITY AT ALL. YES, WP8 DOES NOT CAPABLE OF PROVIDING ANY SECURITY, SO IT IS NOT PROVIDING FILE MANAGER AND DOES NOT ALLOW ITS GENUNE APPLICATIONS TO ACCESS COMMON MEMORY. OFFCOURSE ANY THING MADE INACCESSBLE TO ALL, INCLUDING GENUNE APPLICATIONS CAN BE SAFE.CAN IT BE CALLED AS SECURITY? IT IS REALLY SHAME ON MS.
      
      
      SETTINGS ARE NOT ENOUGH AND LOT OF RESTRICTIONS, FOR EX: YOU CAN NOT STOP VIBRATION COMING WITH BACK-KEY, YOU CAN NOT GET RID OF MESSAGE ALERTS OCCUPYING ENTIRE SCREE.
      
      YOU CAN NOT STOP WP8 ACCESSING INTERNET(WHEN DATA CONNECTION IS ON). IF YOU MISS TO EXTEND YOUR DATA PACK ON-TIME EVERY MONTH, IT SUCKS YOUR MONEY.
      
      
      IE IS PATHETIC, IT DOES NOT HAVE FORWARD OPTION. THE COMMON BACK-CUM-CLOSE KEY CAN BE USED FOR ""BACK"" BUT IT IS ALSO INCONVENIENT. BY DEFAULT IT LOADS LAST ACCESSED PAGE AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT. IT DOES NOT SHOW TILES ON START PAGE. DOWNLAODED FILES DO NOT APPEAR IN MEMORY WHEN CONNECTED TO PC SO YOU CAN NOT COPY FILES ON YOUR PC DIRECTLY.UNFORTUNATELY OPERA-MINI IS NOT AVAILABLE IN WP STORE.
      
      
      ANY INSTALLED APPLICATION CAN NOT ACCESS FILES ON SD CARD. FOR EXAMPLE THE PDF READER CAN NOT OPEN FILES ON SD CARD. IT CAN ONLY OPEN DOWNLOADED FILES AND FILES AT PHONE MEMORY-&GT;DOCUMENT FOLDER AND AGAIN NOT IN SUB FOLDERS. VOICE RECORDER FILES DOES NOT APPEAR IN MEMORY WHEN YOU CONNECTED TO PC.
      
      
      MS OFFICE CAN NOT OPEN FILES WITH PASSWORD. MS TALKS LOT ABOUT SECURITY BUT ITS OFFICE SOFTWARE CAN NOT OPEN FILES WITH PASSWORD PROTECTED.
      
      
      THERE IS NO ""CLOSE"" OPTION TO ANY APPLICATION, YOU HAVE TO PRESS BACK BUTTON MANY TIMES THROUGH ALL THE SCREENS TO FIRST ONE TO CLOSE IT.
      
      
      I REGRET I BELIEVED SOME REVIEWS HAILING WP8 AND PURCHASED WP8 PHONE INSTEAD OF ANDROID ONE.
      
      I HAVE LOT OF SUCH COMPLAINTS AND WRITING ALL OF THEM HERE IS NOT EASY...
      
      
      SO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO GO FOR WINDOWS PHONE.UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO TAKE A TRAINING COURSE ON HOW TO USE IT, READY TO BEAR ALL THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY WP8.
      
      
      SCREEN AND TOUCH ARE GOOD, HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME CONS WITH HW. POOR BATTERY BACK UP. YOU HAVE TO CHARGE ""FULLY"" EVERY DAY ON MODERATE USAGE. IF USE IT INTENSILELY(EX: GAMING OR LONG BROWSING ETC) THEN YOU HAVE TO CHARGE TWICE A DAY.
      
      AVARAGE BUILD QUALITY. NEEDS TO REMOVE BATTERY TO PUT/REMOVE SD CARD OR SIM."

Nokia Lumia 520,1,"PLEASE READ THIS OUT BEFORE BUYING THIS MOBILE OR ANY WINDOWS 8 MOBILE!!!!
      
      (SORRY I RAN OUT OF CHARACTER SPACE HERE, IT IS JUST LIMITED TO 5000 CHARACTERS AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE LIST CONTINUES TO GROW AS I USE THIS MOBILE)
      
      
      I AM NOT SURE WHY NOKIA IS GOING WITH WINDOWS OS, WHICH IS VERY IMMATURE COMPARED TO ANDROID. THIS IS WHY
      
      
      **7/9/13 ONE MORE WORST USABLILITY SCENARIO, ITS LIKE WORST EXPERIENCE FOR ME USING WINDOWS 8...I HAVE ADDED A LOT OF SONGS ON TO THE SD CARD, AND MOST OF THE SONGS WENT IN TO ONE ALBUM, AND IF WE WANT TO GO TO LAST SONG IN THAT ..THATS IT UR GONE, U HAVE TO KEEP ON SCROLLING TO THE END, THERE IS NO FAST SCROLLING AS IN ANDROID. AND THEN THE WORST PART IS THERE IS NO FOLDER VIEW OF ALL THE MUSIC FOLDERS ON THE SD CARD, ONLY THINGS AVAILABLE ARE SONGS/ALBUM/ ETC...CAUSE FOLDER VIEW IS MOST USEFUL IN THE CASE OF SONGS NOT BEING ORGANISED PROPERLY BY ALBUM VIEW OF SONGS...
      
      
      *** EVEN WHEN IN TURN ON WIFI/3G SOME TIMES INTEGRATED FACEBOOK APP IN MESSAGING WIL SAY ""CANT CONNECT NOW"" I HAVE TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES TURNED OFF/ON WIFI/WG, EVEN MOBILE. THEN ALSO IT IS NOT COMING ONLINE
      
      
      ***** THERE IS NO USB TETHERING, ONLY OPTION IS WIFI TETHERING WHICH TAKES A LOT OF BATTERY, THIS IS JUST A BASIC FEATURE, WHICH IS NOT THERE IN THIS********
      
      
      **** WORST THING IS THAT THERE IS NO COMMON PLACE FOR ALL NOTIFICATIONS! SAY SOME ONE PINGED U, IT IS NOTIFIED ON THE TOP FOR FEW SECONDS, AND THATS IT  GONE, WE CANT SEE THAT NOTIFICATION AGAIN! ONLY OPTION IS WE HAVE TO PUT A TILE AND CHECK IT IF NOTIFICATION CAME FROM THAT APP OR NOT..
      
      
      *** JUS NOW FOUND THAT THERE IS NO BACK GROUND DOWNOADING!! IF DOWNLOAD STARTS AND IF WE MOVE TO ANOTHER APP, THATS IT DOWNLOAD STOPS!! WE HAVE TO AGAIN GO TO THE STARTING PLACE AND RESUME DOWNLOAD!!!
      
      
      *** THERE IS NO STANDARD BROWSERS LIKE FIREFOX/CHROME/OPERA/DOLPHIN/ OR ANY GOOD BROWSER OTHER THAN IE BROWSER,WHICH IS VERY BAD. MICROSOFT IS SO LAZY THAT THERE IS NO OPTION TO LET THE BROWSER REMEMBER USERNAME/PASSWORDS EVEN IN THEIR STOCK BROWSER!! MEANS EVERY TIME U WANT TO LOGIN TO SOME WEBSITE, WE HAVE TO TYPE USERNAME/PASSWORD EVERYTIME. AND ALSO IT LIMITS TO JUST 6 TABS, AND THE WORST PART IS, WHEN EVER U SHIFT TO ANOTHER TAB, THE PAGE GETS RELOADED AGAIN. I HAVE NEVER IMAGINED THAT A BROWSER CAN BE MADE LIKE THIS!!
      
      
      1. U HAVE TO PAY ~ 50 RS FOR EVEN BASIC GAMES LIKE ANGRY BIRDS SPACE, STARWARS, THEY GIVE A ""TRY"" OPTION, WHICH WILL MOSTLY HAVE LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY BECAUSE WHEN I TRIED REAL FOOTBALL, IT WAS WORKING ONLY FOR ONE WEEK, BEFORE IT ASKED TO ""BUY""
      
      
      2. THERE IS A OFFICIAL YOUTUBE APP CREATED BY MICROSOFT WHICH WONT WORK PROPERLY, IT IS NOT A APP, IT JUST OPEN A NEW IE TAB AND TRIED TO PLAY VIDEO IN IE(MOBILE MODE) IT JUST SHOWS UP BLANK!! THEN SOME TIMES WHEN IT COMES, IT SAYS THIS FILE FORMAT IS NOT SUPPORTED ON THIS MOBILE(I TRIED PLAY MANY VIDEOS), AND THEN I TRIED IN IE(DESKTOP MODE) IT STARTED PLAYING, AND THEN CRASHED AND MOBILE REBOOTED. CAN U EVER IMAGINE THIS KIND OF NON SENSE IN ANDROID MOBILE JUST FOR PLAYING YOUTUBE VIDEOS?
      
      
      3. IN THE MUSIC PLAYER, THERE IS NO OPTION TO JUST TAP AND MOVE TO PARTICULAR PART OF SONG! WHICH I THOUGHT VERY BASIC THING A MUSIC PLAYER SHOULD HAVE. WE HAVE TO LONG PRESS FAST FORWARD ICON TO MOVE QUICKLY TO SOME PART OF SONG!
      
      
      4. NO KEYBOARD SWYPE FEATURE!!
      
      
      5. WORST PART IS WE HAVE TO CONNECT TO COMPUTER AND COPY A SONG TO RINGTONES FOLDER, TO SET IT AS RINGTONE, I MEAN WE CANT DIRECTLY SET IT!! BASIC STUFF!! ALL THIS IS NO FILE MANAGER(NOT EVEN ANY APP TOO) IN WINDOWS 8.
      
      
      6. WHEN WE COPY PHOTOS TO SD CARD, THEY HAVE NOT GOT DETECTED UNTIL I RESTARTED THE MOBILE.
      
      
      7. MANY GAMES WHICH ARE FREE/LESS COSTLY ARE ALL 2/3 TIMES COSTLIER IN WINDOWS!!
      
      
      8. GOOGLE MAPS IS MUCH BETTER IN TERMS OF DETAILS IT SHOWS! ONLY THING IS WE CAN DOWNLOAD MAPS OFFLINE, AND CAN DO OFFLINE NAVIGATION, IF THE PALCE UR SEARCHING IS IN THE LOCAL DATABASE.
      
      
      9. THERE ARE NO GOOD MUSIC PLAYERS LIKE VLC/REAL/MX AS IN ANDROID,
      
      
      10. BASIC APP LIKE FACEBOOK APP IS CRASHING LIKE ANYTHING
      
      
      11. THERE IS NO GTALK APP, SO I TRIED NIMBUZZ, EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE UNTIL WE USE IT, BUT IF WE GO TO HOME SCREEN/SHIFT TO ANOTHER APP, WE WONT GET ANY NOTIFICATION THAT SOME ONE PINGED U, WE HAVE TO AGAIN OPEN NIMBUZZ TO SEE IF SOME ONE PINGED U. AND THERE ARE NO BETTER APPS FOR CHATTING OTHER THAN NIMBUZZ.
      
      
      12. ALL THESE POINTS WILL BE THE SAME ON ANY WINDOWS PHONE, BECAUSE IT IS THE PROBLEM WITH WINDOWS PHONE, NOT WITH NOKIA, AND I WILL  UPDATE WITH MORE ISSUE WHEN I FIND THEM.
      
      
      THESE ARE SOME GOOD POINTS,
      
      
      1. GOOD BATTERY LIFE.
      
      2. QUICK CHARGIN.
      
      3. OS IS FAST, NO LAGGING TILL NOW
      
      4. TOUCH SCREEN IS GRT.
      
      5. OFFLINE NAVIGATION
      
      
      OTHER POINTS:
      
      SOUND QUALITY IN EXTERNAL SPEAKER IS GOOD
      
      SOUND QUALITY IN EARPHONES IS JUST ABOUT AVERAGE(NOT BAD WITH REASONABLE BASS WITH APPLE EARPHONES WHICH ARE ONE OF THE BEST. WHEN I TRIED WITH SONY EAR BUDS (WHICH CAME WITH XPERIA ION AND SOUNDED GRT WITH IT), BASS IS TOOO LOW FOR US TO NJOY THE SONG)."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"PRO :-BATTERY BACK UP IS TWO DAYS ON MODERATE USAGE , NOISE CANCELLATION IS GOOD ...    CONS :-BUT THE BROWSING EXPERIENCE IS WORST . SCREEN IS ALWAYS BLINKING WHILE USING 3G . SAME NAME OF A VIDEO OR MUSIC IS REPEATED SO MANY TIMES IN THE MUSIC + VIDEO APPLICATION. PHONE IS HEATING A LOT .CAMERA QUALITY IS BELOW AVERAGE . MOST OF THE GAMES ARE LAGGING . SOUND IN NOT AT ALL GOOD . I HAVE USED MORE THAN THREE DIFFERENT EARPHONES , BUT THE SOUND IN ONE SIDE IS TOO LOUD AND THE OTHER SIDE IS TOO LOW EVEN WITH THE NOKIA EARPHONES WHICH COMES WITH THE PACKAGE. APPS LIKE WHATSAPP , WE CHAT , LINE ETC ., ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY . MESSAGES WILL BE DELIVERED AFTER HOURS FROM SENDING . CAMERA QUALITY IS PATHETIC . THINK BEFORE U BUY ...  DNT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS AND ITS NOTHING COMPARED TO ANDROID DEVICES ........."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,PURCHASED THIS MODEL AND THE MOMENT I OPEN THE BOX AND FOUND CAMERA BUTTON NOT WORKING . WHEN CALLED CUSTOMER CARE THEY TOLD SINCE IT IS OUT OF STOCK CANT REPLACE INSTEAD THEY CAN GIVE THE MONEY BACK :( . NOW I AM RETURNING THIS MODEL .. RATING GIVEN FOR NOKIA PHONE NOT FOR FLIP KART . FLIP KART SUPPORT IS EXCELLENT ..
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"RECEIVED THE PHONE VERY QUICKLY. BUT IT WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL. WE TRIED TO SWITCHED IT ON AND IT JUST SHOWED ""NOKIA"" LOGO AND THEN DEAD. WE CALLED FLIPKART AND THEY RESPONDED QUICKLY BY REGISTERING OUR COMPLAINT AND ASKED THE SELLER TO GET IT REPLACED.
      
      MEANWHILE WE PAID A VISIT TO LOCAL AUTHORIZED NOKIA SERVICE CENTER IN BANGALORE. THEY WERE POLITE ENOUGH TO UPGRADE THE SOFTWARE IMMEDIATELY AND PHONE STARTED WORKING AS NEW.
      
      ITS BEEN LESS THAN A MONTH WE ARE USING THE PHONE AND THINGS ARE GOOD.
      
      SO, WE SAY FLIKPART IS GOOD, SELLER IS NOT!
      
      ALL THIS WHEN IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY FRIEND. IMAGINE THE EMBARRASSMENT!!!!"
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"REVIEW AS ON 26TH JUNE 2013 (I HAVE REDUCED THE RATING FROM 3 STARS TO 1 STAR)
      
      
      I SOLD MY YELLOW LUMIA 520 AFTER USING IF FOR JUST TWO AND A HALF MONTHS. AND I BOUGHT FAME WHICH IS HANDY AND JELLY BEAN IS INCOMPARABLE TO WINDOWS 8. JELLY BEAN IS AWESOME.
      
      
      FAME DOES NOT GET HEATED UP AS LUMIA 520 KEEPS ON GETTING HEATED UP TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE CAN NOT TOUCH UPPER PART OF THE PHONE. I VISITED THE AUTHORISED NOKIA CENTER AND THEY TOLD IT IS NORMAL IF THE PHONE IS HEATING UP. FAME IS COOL AS EVER AS IT IS FROM SAMSUNG. HERE SAMSUNG BEATS OTHER BRANDS LIKE SONY, MICROMAX, NOKIA AS THEY TEND TO HEAT UP SOON.
      
      
      ANDROID JELLY BEAN IS LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF WINDOWS 8. MY SINCERE ADVICE DONT BUY LUMIA 520 AND ONLY BUY SAMSUNG GALAXY PHONES IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR COOL :) :)
      
      THANKS
      
      
      REVIEW AS ON 15TH APRIL 2013
      
      THANK YOU NOKIA FOR THROWING IT IN THE MARKET FOR SUCH CHEAP PRICE.
      
      I AM USING SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE II AND BELIEVE ME THE DISPLAY OF LUMIA 520 IS NO LESS THAN IT.
      
      ISSUE: I USED WHATSAPP FOR 2 MINUTES AND THE PHONE HEATED UP BADLY. IT GETS HEAT UP WITHIN A MINUTE WHILE BROWSING AND YOU CAN NOT TOUCH THE UPPER PART AT THE ANTENNA SIDE. I CALLED NOKIA CUSTOMER CARE AND WAS TOLD THAT IT TAKES 4-5 DAYS FOR A SMARTPHONE TO SET. THEREAFTER THE HEATING PROBLEM WILL VANISH. LETS SEE.
      
      IT HAS A PROXIMINTY SENSOR TOO WHICH IS NOT MENTIONED ON THE NOKIA WEBSITE.
      
      WORTH EACH PENNY IF HEATING PROBLEM IS RESOLVED. I SPENT 50 BUCKS FOR MAKING MY SIM TO MICRO SIM. ANY PHONE SHOP WILL DO THAT. AND IT IS A MATTER OF SECONDS.
      
      I AM ENJOYING THE YELLOW COLOR. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS NOT IN DEMAND. I CHOSE IT OVER CYAN AND RED.
      
      THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW."

      8. WHEN YOU CONNECT YOUR FACEBOOK AND OTHER ACCOUNTS, YOUR PHONE WILL BE FLUSHED WITH THE FACEBOOK PHOTOS,CONTACTS ETC ETC.. WHICH IRRITATES ALOT.
      
      
      9. IF A MUSIC FILE DNT HAV ANY ARTIST NAME, GENRE, ALBUM NAME, BUT ONLY HAVE FILE NAME,            THESE TYPES OF FILES ARE LIKE LOST IN THE PHONE. U CANNOT TRACE THEM AT ALL.
      
      
      10. NO SEPARATE FOLDERS FOR YOUR APPS PHOTOS AND VIDEOS. FOR EXAMPLE TAKE WHATSAPP IN ANDROID, IT HAS A FOLDER FOR PHOTOS AND VIDEOS BUT IN WINDOWS , PHOTOS WILL BE SAVED IN SAVED PICTURES FOLDER. AND THE VIDEOS SAVED AT THAT PLACE , EVEN THE PHONE DNT KNO. TO PLAY THOSE VIDEOS, GO TO THAT CONTACT IN WHATSAPP, AND THEN U CAN PLAY THAT VIDEO. BUT SAME HERE, U CANNOT TRANSFER IT.

      18. NO SEPRATE BUTTON FOR CONTROLLING RINGTONE VOLUME AND MUSIC VOLUME
      
      
      19. AND A LOT OF ISSUES ARE GETTING EVERY DAY.....
      
      
      THESE ARE THE REASON WHY NOKIA IS FALLING DOWN IN THE MARKET WHILE ANDROID RULES THE SMARTPHONE MARKET.I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE FOR RS.11099 FROM THE SHOP."
Nokia Lumia 520,1,"SORRY TO SAY THAT..
      
      
      I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS WHILE PURCHASING THIS HANDSET AS THIS WAS HAVING A GOOD CONFIGURATION WITH WINDOWS 8 OS...
      
      
      MY EXPERIANCE WITH THIS WAS VERY BAD AS IT STOPPED WORKING ON THE FIRST DAY ITSELF.THE DEVICE KEPT ON REBOOTING ITSELF INDEFINITELY.
      
      I TOOK IT TO NOKIA CARE THEY SAID THERES A PBLM WITH SOFTWARE.THEY FIXED IT FREE OF CHARGE.
      
      
      NOW, ON USING THE DEVICE I FOUND THE DEVICE GETTING HEATED UP LIKE ANYTHING. THE DEVICE IS IN FACTORY SETTING WITHOUT ANY EXTRA APPLICATIONS INSTALLED, WITH ALL THE SERVICES LIKE WIFI, MOBILE DATA, BLUETOOTH
      
      AND ALL DISABLED, I DONT FIND A REASON WHY IT HAPPENS?
      
      
      NOKIA CARE DONT HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THIS.THEY ASKED ME TO SEND THE SAME BACK TO THE FACTORY.
      
      
      IT SEEMS LIKE FLIPKART ALSO DOESNT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS ISSUE. VERY BAD RESPONSE FROM FLIPKART REGARDING THIS ISSUE."

      1. CONNECTIVITY PROBLEM....WHEN U LOCK THE PHONE SCREEN THE U WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE MSG ON WHATSAPP, IM+  AND FEW OTHER MESSENGER AND EVEN NOT AFTER UNLOCK THE SCREEN. U WILL NOT RECEIVE THE MSG  STILL U WILL NOT OPEN THE PARTICULAR APPLICATION.
      
      
      2.. SHARING  VIDEOS VIA BLUETOOTH...NOT ABLE TO SHARE VIDEOS VIA BT FROM THE VIDEOS FOLDER BUT U CAN SHARE VIDEOS THAT U RECEIVE VIA BT
      
      
      3. PHONE NOT VIBRATING PROPERLY WHEN GET A CALL..VIBRATION IS VERY SLOW AND VIBRATE ONE OR 2 TIMES IN A SINGLE INCOMING CALL.
      
      FINALLY IT SUCKS.............
      
      BUT PHONE LOOKING IS GUD.. BUT NOT GO FOR BUYING THIS."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"1.SOME LOOSER'S DOESN'T KNOW THAT THE FM IS ENABLED IN THE HARDWARE, MICROSOFT WORKING ON IT,MAY BE IN THE NEXT UPDATE WE CAN GET THE FM APP IN THE SOFTWARE SIDE :)
      
      2.AM USING LUMIA 620 FOR MORE THAN A MONTH,REALLY I DONT NEED A FILE MANAGER..! TO ACCESS MUSIC,MUSIC APP IS THERE FOR VIDEOS VISE VERSA :)
      
      3.WHY DO YOU NEED TASK MANAGER ? BEFORE BUY A MOBILE READ THE EXPERT REVIEWS FULLY AND THEN BUY :P
      
      4.WORTH THE MONEY :)"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"1] DUAL SHOT PANELS LOOKS COOL AND INDEED STURDY. THERE ARE A BUNCH OF COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM.
      
      
      2] BEST DISPLAY WITH NOKIA - CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY. USE IT UNDER A DIRECT SUNLIGHT WITH NO DIFFICULTY.
      
      
      3] NOKIA APPS ARE JUST AWESOME AND VERY HELPFUL. NOKIA MUSIC, MIX RADIO, HERE DRIVE, HERE MAPS, HERE TRANSIT, HERE CITY LENS AND MAY MORE FOR FREE. REMEMBER YOU GET THE OFFLINE MAPS AND NOKIA MUSIC ONLY ON NOKIA DEVICES.
      
      
      4] CAMERA WITH SMART SHOOT. ONE CLICK WILL TAKE SEVERAL SHOTS, PICK THE BEST YOU LIKE. YOU ALSO GET A FRONT FACING CAMERA FOR VIDEO CALLS.
      
      
      5] SNAPDRAGON? S4 - DUAL-CORE 1 GHZ PROCESSOR WITH 512 MB RAM. TRUST ME THIS IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO RUN THIS DEVICE BUTTER SMOOTH.
      
      
      6] THE LAST AND THE BEST PART IS IT?S A WINDOWS PHONE. USE THIS FOR FEW DAYS AND I'M SURE YOU'LL NEVER TOUCH ANY OTHER OS."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"AFTER 40 DAYS OF HEAVY USAGE AND ONE REPLACEMENT BY FLIPKART MY REVIEW STANDS TO THE FOLLOWING POINTS
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. 3.8 INCH SCREEN WITH RESOLUTION GIVES AN AMAZING DISPLAY FEEL AND SITS COMFORTABLY IN YOUR HAND. (I CANNOT HANDLE A GALAXY S3 COMFORTABLY).
      
      2.  WINDOWS PHONE 8 OS IS NOT JUST GREAT. IT IS AMAZING AT THE WAY IT HANDLES ALL TASKS ESPECIALLY INTEGRATING SOCIAL NETWORKS.
      
      3. AT THAT COST, NO PHONE IN THE MARKET IS ""FUTURE-PROOF"". A GOOD CAMERA, NFC AND AN OS WHOSE LONGTERM SUPPORT IS PROMISED.
      
      4. BUILD: UNLIKE OTHER PHONES, THE BUILD FEELS PREMIUM. I OWN A BLACK MATTE FINISH AND IT HAS PERFECT BALANCE OF MATTE FINISH AND POLISHED KEYS.
      
      4. CLEARBACK DISPLAY: I EVEN HAD A S3 OWNER SAY ""S**T I CAN READ YOUR SCREEN UNDER DIRECT SUN"". IF YOU ARE ALWAYS OUT IN SUN AND I SUPPOSE WE USE MAPS ONLY WHEN WE ARE MOVING, CLEARBACK IS A MUST.
      
      5. SUMMING UP OTHER THINGS. POPULAR APPS ARE ALREADY THERE. AND THEIR INTERFACE IS WELL INTEGRATED INTO OS SO THAT YOU WONT FEEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SWITCHING APPS. EVERY APP, SAME GESTURES. NOKIA SPECIFIC APPS ARE GREAT. AND LENSES, THEY ARE AMAZING EVEN FOR A RARE-CLICKER LIKE ME. INFACT AFTER THIS PHONE, I STARTED CLICKING AWAY
      
      
      CONS
      
      1. BATTERY: THE PHONE CANNOT CRAWL THROUGH HALF A DAY UPON CONTINUOUS 3G WITH MODERATE TO HEAVY MAILING AND 30-40 MIN CALL. ON MY AVERAGE DAY IT JUST PULLED THROUGH THE DAY.
      
      2. APPS: WELL, YES. I PAID FOR FEW APPS WHICH I COULD FIND FOR FREE FOR ANDROID. BUT APP STORE STILL IS DRAGGING BEHIND ANDROID AND IOS.
      
      3. HEATING PROBLEM: UPON ON LONG CALLS (1-1.4 HR ) OR AFTER A GAMING SESSION, I FIND THE PHONE HEATED UP.
      
      
      COMPARISONS: PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT A MISSING FILE MANAGER IN PHONE. I AM NOT IN FAVOUR OF IT BECAUSE THE PHONE SHOULD KNOW WHERE TO PUT YOUR FILES. AND ALSO OS NEEDS SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES IN MAINTAINING A FILE MANAGER. I PREFER TO TAP ON MUSIC TO FIND MY MUSIC OR PHOTOS TO SEE MY PHOTOS RATHER THAN GO TO /MNT/SDCARD/FOLDER1/FOLDER2 ETC ETC. IF EVER YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO REARRANGE, PLUGIN INTO A WINDOWS PC AND DRAG-DROP
      
      
      VERDICT: IF YOU WANT A SWITCH FROM ANDROID AND CARE MORE ABOUT THE SIMPLICITY OF TASK MANAGEMENT RATHER THAN APP-FOR THIS- APP- FOR THAT MODEL, WINDOWS PHONE IS A MUST.  NOKIA OR HTC IS AT THE END USER DECISION. BUT NOKIA-SPECIFIC APPS ARE GREAT UTILITIES."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"AFTER BEING IN A DILEMMA FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS, I FINALLY DECIDED TO BUY NOKIA LUMIA 620 A WEEK AGO AND TRUST ME, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I HAVE TAKEN WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY. THE VIBRANT COLOURS NOKIA OFFERS, MAKES MY LUMIA 620 STAND OUT IN THE LEAGUE OF STYLISH PHONES. THE FRONT SIDE OF MY LUMIA 620 HAS A 3.8-INCH CAPACITIVE LCD CLEARBLACK DISPLAY WITH A WVGA RESOLUTION OF 480 X 800 PIXELS WHICH GIVES MY PHONE A SMART AND SLEEK LOOK AND THE COMPACTNESS LETS ME HANDLE IT WITH EASE.
      
      
      I CAN KEEP ALL MY FILES AND DOCUMENTS IN MY PHONE NOW WITH AN 8 GB BACKUP ALONG WITH 7 GB SKYDRIVE SPACE IT PROVIDES. NOTHING COULD HAVE AWED ME MORE THAN THE AMAZING PICTURE QUALITY CAPTURED BY THE 5 MP CAMERA WITH THE SMARTSHOOT FEATURE WHICH LETS ME SELECT THE BEST SNAP OUT OF A NUMBER OF SNAPS. THE CINEMAGRAPH FEATURE LETS ME ANIMATE A STILL IMAGE WHICH IS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE. MY LUMIA 620 ALSO HAS A FRONT FACING VGA CAMERA. ALSO, MY PHONE COMES WITH A 1,300MAH BATTERY, CLAIMING UP TO 15 HOURS OF TALK TIME (2G) AND MANY HOURS OF MUSIC PLAYBACK."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"AFTER HAVING USED A MULTITUDE OF PHONES, RIGHT FROM THE BASIC ONES TO THE HIGH-END SMARTPHONES, I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MY NEW NOKIA LUMIA 620 IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR ME IN TERMS OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND STATE-OF-THE-ART FEATURES. THE LUMIA SERIES ITSELF FROM THE FINNISH BRAND HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF A REVELATION, BUT MY LUMIA 620 IS THE OPTIMUM CHOICE. THE THING THAT MOST IMPRESSED ME WAS THE DARING THAT NOKIA HAD, TO ADOPT MICROSOFT?S WINDOWS 8 PLATFORM CONSIDERING IT WAS NEW AND UNTESTED BEFORE. THE RISK, I HAVE TO SAY, HAS PAID RICH DIVIDENDS. THE WINDOWS 8 PLATFORM ON MY LUMIA 620 LOOKS RICH, CLASSY AND EXTREMELY REFINED ? A BREAK AWAY FROM THE GRID-BASED COMMON MENU SYSTEM OF ANDROIDS AND IPHONES.
      
      
      TO DELVE INTO THE FEATURES OF WINDOWS 8, IT COMES WITH PEOPLEHUB, A MIGHTY CONVENIENT FEATURE THAT LETS ME TAG ALL MY PALS TO THE HOME SCREEN SO THAT I RECEIVE ALL THEIR SOCIAL NETWORKING UPDATES AND BIRTHDAY REMINDERS RIGHT ON MY HOME SCREEN. I DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE THE EFFORT OF LOCATING THEIR SOCIAL NETWORKING PROFILES AND THEN NAVIGATING AND BROWSING THROUGH THEM. THE LIVE TILES INTERFACE PROVIDES REAL-TIME UPDATES AND ALSO LETS ME ARRANGE ALL MY FREQUENTLY USED APPS ON MY HOME SCREEN FOR EASY ACCESS. AS THIS IS A MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEM, MS OFFICE SUPPORT IS BUILT INTO MY LUMIA 620. WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT; EVERYTHING OPENS UP IN A JIFFY AND I CAN VIEW AND EDIT DOCUMENTS WITH EASE. MS OUTLOOK SIMULATES MY DESKTOP EMAIL MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE TO THE T, HELPING ME STAY IN TOUCH WITH MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES.
      
      
      ON THE ENTERTAINMENT AND MULTIMEDIA FRONT TOO, MY LUMIA 620 IS A CHAMP. THE BUILT-IN AUDIO AND VIDEO PLAYERS SUPPORT A VARIETY OF FORMATS. VIEWING VIDEOS, WATCHING MOVIES, PREVIEWING IMAGES AND BROWSING THE WEB ? EVERYTHING IS A SHEER JOY ON THE 3.8-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY. IT COMES WITH CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY THAT INJECTS HIGH CONTRAST AND TRUE-TO-LIFE COLOUR IN EVERY IMAGE AND PROVIDES ENHANCED READABILITY UNDER DIRECT SUNLIGHT. THE REAR 5 MP CAMERA ON MY LUMIA 620 IS A REVELATION WITH ITS CAPABILITY TO CLICK GREAT SNAPS DUE TO THE CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS. WITH THE INTEGRATED FLASH, LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY RENDERS EQUALLY GOOD RESULTS. I USE THE SMARTSHOOT AND CINEMAGRAPH DIGITAL LENSES ON MY LUMIA 620 FREQUENTLY TO VERY GOOD EFFECT. SMARTSHOOT LETS ME CREATE THE PERFECT GROUP SHOT DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO SNAP UP MULTIPLE SHOTS AND ALLOWING ME TO EDIT THEM ON THE FLY. CINEMAGRAPH ALLOWS ADDING ANIMATION TO STILL IMAGES.
      
      
      ALL THE PROCESSING POWER OF MY LUMIA 620 COMES FROM THE 1 GHZ DUAL-CORE SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR AND 512 MB RAM. NAVIGATION IS SMOOTH AND GLITCH-FREE AND THE LAG IS NEARLY NON-EXISTENT. ON THE MEMORY FRONT, MY PHONE?S 8 GB OF ON-BOARD STORAGE MEMORY IS ENOUGH FOR DATA STORAGE NEEDS, BUT IT COMES WITH SKYDRIVE STORAGE OF AN ADDITIONAL 7 GB JUST IN CASE. THE BATTERY LIFE IS PRETTY GOOD TOO AND DOES NOT HAVE ME RUNNING AROUND FOR A CHARGING POINT."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"AS TOLD BY VIKTOR TO GO FOR 720 BY PAYING 3-4K EXTRA.
      
      
      3-4K IS NOT A SMALL AMOUNT.
      
      
      ALSO WHY SHOULD ONE PAY 3-4K EXTRA WHEN ONE GETS THE SAME HARDWARE.
      
      
      LET ME TELL YOU THE CONS OF 720
      
      
      1)RAM IS 512MB(SAME AS 620 AND 520 I.E CANNOT PLAY HD GAMES LIKE MODERN COMBAT 4 AND TEMPLE RUN WHICH REQUIRE 1GB RAM)
      
      2)UNIBODY-CANNOT CHANGE BACK COVERS LIKE 620 AND 520(STRUCK TO ONE COLOUR)
      
      
      THE ONLY GOOD THING FOUND IN THE 720 IS THE CAMERA(BETTER THAN MY SAMUSNG GS2'S CAMERA).OTHERWISE ALL THE FEATURES ARE THE SAME.
      
      
      MY ADVICE BUY A 520/620 AND BUY A 64GB CLASS 6 CARD."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"AWESOME PHONE. I LOOKED AT BATTERY PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS RATED MUCH BETTER THAN EVEN 920 EVEN THOUGH IT IS A SMALLER BATTERY. EXCELLENT PHONE.
      
      
      AND IT IS A NOKIA AND IT HAS DRIVE +, NOKIA MUSIC, ETC ETC.. AND CHANGEABLE SHELLS.. THAT'S GREAT."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT, I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A BUDGET PHONE FOR MYSELF LATELY AND THAT IS WHEN MY EYES DAWNED UPON NOKIA LUMIA 620, WHICH I CONSIDER AS ONE OF MY WISEST CHOICES TILL DATE. THE PHONE HAS TILL NOW LIVED UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS. TO SWITCH TO A WINDOWS PHONE WAS A TOUGH DECISION, BUT I NEVER REALLY REGRETTED IT ANY INSTANT, AS NOKIA HAS BEEN DOING GREAT WORK ON ITS OS. BACK TO THE PHONE, IT NEVER STOPS ME FROM MAKING A STYLE STATEMENT WITH ITS SET OF INTERCHANGEABLE COVERS THAT COME IN SPLENDID COLOURS: LIME GREEN, ORANGE, MAGENTA, YELLOW, CYAN, WHITE AND BLACK. THEY ALLOW ME TO MATCH THEM WITH MY MOOD AND PANACHE.
      
      
      MY NOKIA LUMIA 620 IS LIGHT AT 127G AND FITS WELL IN THE HAND. IT CAN BE OPERATED WITH JUST ONE HAND UNLIKE OTHER SMARTPHONES OUT IN THE MARKET TODAY. THE 3.8IN TFT TOUCHSCREEN WITH A PIXEL DENSITY OF 246 PPI IS A TREAT FOR THE EYES AND KEEPS ME IN AWE WHENEVER PLAYING VIDEOS OR GAMES ON IT. INTEGRATED WITH NOKIA?S INNOVATIVE CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY, IT DELIVERS HIGH CONTRAST, CRYSTAL CLEAR DISPLAY AT AN UNPARALLELED LEVEL. THIS TECHNOLOGY ALSO ENHANCES THE READABILITY IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT.
      
      
      THE 5 MP CAMERA MAKES ME FORGET MY PROFESSIONAL CAMERA WHEN I GO OUT ROAMING WITH MY FRIENDS THESE DAYS. THE CAMERA COMES PRE-INSTALLED WITH SOME COOL FEATURES, LIKE THE ALL NEW CINEMAGRAPH FEATURE THAT LETS ME ANIMATE MY PICS, SOMETIMES EVEN MAKING THEM LOOK FUNNY BY THE PROCESS. THE SMARTSHOOT DIGITAL LENS IS ANOTHER SUPER COOL FEATURE THAT LETS ME TAKE A STREAM OF PICS WITH A SINGLE CLICK. SO WHEN CLICKING A GROUP, I NEED NOT PAY ATTENTION IF ALL ARE GIVING ME THEIR BEST POSE, AS LATER ON I CAN PICK THE BEST EXPRESSIONS FROM ALL THE PICS AND PUT THEM DOWN IN ONE.
      
      
      THE CITY LENS FEATURE NEVER LETS ME MISS OUT ON EATING JOINTS, PUBS, SHOPPING CENTRES OR MOVIE THEATRES WHEN I AM TRAVELLING. THE COOLEST FEATURE FOR A GAMES FREAK LIKE ME IS XBOX 360 SUPPORT THAT GIVES ME THE POWER TO USE THE PHONE AS MY XBOX CONTROLLER. IT CAN ALSO BE USED AS A KEYBOARD OR A MOUSE. NOW FOR ME, THAT IS ICING ON THE CAKE.
      
      
      MY LUMIA 620 COMES PRE-LOADED WITH INTERNET EXPLORER 10, OUTLOOK, WORD, EXCEL AND POWERPOINT AND BECOMES MY OFFICE ON THE GO. IT RUNS OFF A 1 GHZ DUAL-CORE SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR COUPLED WITH AN ADRENO 305 GPU AND 512 MB OF RAM. THESE SPECS ARE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO RUN ALL HIGH-END APPS AND GAMES. THE PHONE COMES PRELOADED WITH 8 GB OF INTERNAL MEMORY EXPANDABLE UP TO 64 GB WITH A MICROSD CARD SLOT. ALL USERS ARE ALSO OFFERED 7 GB OF SKYDRIVE STORAGE WHICH IS YET ANOTHER INCENTIVE TO INVEST ONE?S MONEY INTO THE DEVICE. THE BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO IMPRESSIVE WITH APPROX. 14.6 HRS OF 2G TALK TIME AND 10 HRS OF 3G TALK TIME."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"BEST IN PRICE V/S PERFORMANCE OVER &GT; 720
      
      
      BETTER THAN 520..
      
      
      JUST GO FOR IT..
      
      
      I AM LOVING THIS PHONE..
      
      
      THE UI OF WINDOWS PHONE 8 COMBINED WITH DURABILITY AND EXCLUSIVE APPS FROM NOKIA MAKES THIS THE BEST CHOICE OF WINDOWS PHONES IN MARKET IN THIS PRICE RANGE.."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"BOUGHT THIS MOBILE 4-5 DAYS BACK(NOT FROM FLIPKART THOUGH).
      
      GUYS TRUST ME, A PHONE WORTH ITS VALUE.
      
      ONLY CON THAT GOT ME WORRIED IS THE BATTERY BACKUP.
      
      THE PHONE HAS SOME SERIOUS ISSUES REGARDING BATTERY BACKUP IF YOU ENABLE THE DATA SERVICES(THAT TOO WITH ONLY 2G ENABLED).
      
      OTHERWISE,LIKE I TOLD EARLIER,THIS IS A PHONE WORTH BUYING."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,CAN WE INSERT A 1700 MAH BATTERY OR HIGHER IN 620 PLZ REPLY ME................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"FIRST OF ALL THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR ITS WONDERFULL SERVICE. THOUGHT THE EXPECTED DELIVERY WAS 3-4 DAYS, I GOT IT IN 2 DAYS.
      
      
      AND WHAT A NICE PHONE IT IS. SUPERB.
      
      TOUCH IS GREAT.
      
      HIGHLY RESEARCHED PHONE.
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING IT FROM LAST ONE MONTH AND IT GAVE ME NO PROBLEMS."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"FIRST, FLIPKART'S DELIVERY, AS USUAL, IS AWESOME. THIS WAS MY FIRST PRODUCT THAT GOT DELIVERED IN 24HOURS INSTEAD OF TWO DAYS!
      
      
      THE PHONE, FOR THE PRICE I GOT IT (INR 13,396, DUE TO THE DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME) WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE PURCHASE FOR ANY OS OR MANUFACTURER AT THE TIME, WHICH IS A MONTH BACK.
      
      
      SOFTWARE:
      
      INITIALLY I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS I HAD TO MAKE TO MY MENTALITY WITH FEW OF THE DRAWBACK - NO MASS STORAGE BUT MTP SYNCING, NO SPEED DIAL, NO FILE MANAGER, ETC. BUT, AS I GOT AROUND TO IT, I REALISED HOW AWESOME AND DIFFERENT THE INTERFACE IS, THE INTEGRATION WITH ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS (THOUGH I DON'T USE IT MUCH), THE SIMPLICITY OF VOLUME CONTROL, LOCK SCREEN WALLPAPERS, QUALITY APPS AVAILABLE IF YOU ARE PATIENT, BECAUSE EVERY COUPLE WEEKS YOU SEE ANOTHER POPULAR MAKER ENTERING THE WP8 WORLD. BIGGEST PLUS IS THAT NO ONE REPORTS A LAGGY AND SLOW WINDOWS PHONE AFTER MONTHS OF USAGE. INTERNET EXPLORER IS GOING TO GIVE YOU THE BEST POSSIBLE WEB BROWSING VIEW (I SAY VIEW BECAUSE THE FEATURES AREN' THAT GREAT, BUT THE RENDERING IS BEAUTIFUL!).
      
      
      HARDWARE:
      
      FOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED PRICE, OR EVEN ADD 5000 RUPEES MORE, YOU WON'T GET ANOTHER BRAND FOR THIS QUALITY, IMO. THE CAMERA AT 5MP GIVES DECENT RESOLUTION BUT GORGEOUS QUALITY PICTURES IN DAYLIGHT. IN FLASH IT LOOKS BELOW AVERAGE - LIKE SOME INSTAGRAM EFFECT HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE IMAGES). THE VIDEO RECORDING IS ABOVE AVERAGE WITH 30 FPS 720P QUALITY VIDEO AND GOOD AUDIO. I LOVE SHOWING OFF THE HARDWARE TO MY FRIENDS! ALSO, THE FLASH IS USEFUL TO HAVE ALONG WITH THE FEATURE OF THE VIDEO TO TURN ON THE LIGHT. I HAVE SEEN SOME PHONES IN ANDROID THAT LACK THIS BASIC FEATURE! THE DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS A BIT ON THE THICKER SIDE - SOME FRIENDS THOUGHT I WAS HAVING A COVER ON IT WHILE IT'S ACTUALLY THE BACK COVER OF THE PHONE! BUT STILL, IT'S A CLASSY DESIGN AND HAS IT'S OWN UNIQUE STYLE. THE SCREEN QUALITY IS GORGEOUS! THE BLACK ON IT GIVES YOU A FEEL OF QUALITY AND CLASS! AT A 300 PPI QUALITY, YOU WON'T SEE THE INDIVIDUAL PIXELS WITH YOUR NAKED EYE, APPLE'S RETINA SCREEN ANYONE?
      
      THE DESIGN IS SO WELL THOUGHT OUT, THAT YOU REALISE IF THE SPEAKER HOLE WAS A MILLIMETRE MORE INWARDS, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUFFLED EVERYTIME YOU KEPT THE PHONE ON ITS BACK, LIKE SOME OF THOSE MICROMAX MODELS. BUT HERE IT'S PERFECTLY AUDIBLE FOR A FULL FLAT BACK. BE CAREFUL WHEN HANDLING THE PHONE BECAUSE ITS SMOOTH MATTE FINISH IS VERY SLIPPERY AS YOUR HAND WONT FIND FRICTION ON IT.
      
      HOWEVER, THE MOST USELESS SOFT BUTTON ON THE PHONE IS THE 'BING SEARCH' THAT KEEPS GETTING PRESSED BY MISTAKE AND WILL TAKE YOU TO THE BING SEARCH THAT NO ONE USES, LOL.
      
      
      LIST OF INTERESTING APPS ON WINDOWS PHONE THAT I USE:
      
      1. TWITTER
      
      2. WHATSAPP
      
      3. WALLBASE
      
      4. INSIDER
      
      5. DRESS VS ZOMBIES
      
      6. CHESS BY POST
      
      7. NEXTGEN READER
      
      8. FICTION READER (LITE)
      
      9. DEFAULT 'HERE' NAVIGATION APPS
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, IF YOU HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND WILLING TO DO A BIT OF RESEARCH WHEN YOU RUN INTO 'PROBLEMS' ON THIS OS, SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED CASH ON A LUMIA *20 SERIES INSTEAD OF THOSE 'COMMON PHONES' OUT THERE! ENJOY!"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"FIRSTLY I WANT TO THANKS NOKIA FOR CREATING SUCH A WONDERFUL PHONE THANKS NOKIA AND THIS TIME U R BACK IN SMARTPHONE MARKET BIG TIME...

Nokia Lumia 620,5,"FIRSTLY, I WAS SO AFRAID TO BUY THIS PHONE. PEOPLE WERE KEEP TELLING ME THIS WILL NOT BE A GOOD IDEA. THERE ARE VERY FEW APPS FOR WINDOWS PHONE. I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH.FINALLY, I DECIDED TO GO FOR NOKIA LUMIA 620. NOW I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE AND ITS APPLICATIONS. IT WAS A GOOD CALL AND I AM HAPPY FOR IT. ACCORDING TO MY REQUIREMENT ONLY TWO THINGS ARE MISSING..1) FM 2) FORWARD AND REWIND FOR MUSIC PLAYER.

Nokia Lumia 620,5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY NOKIA LUMIA 620! IT HAS LIVED UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS. I HAVE NO REGRETS WITH THIS PURCHASE WHATSOEVER. THE SPECS ARE AMAZING. GREAT CAMERA! THE INTERFACE IS SO SIMPLE AND VERY WELL DONE. I'D RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A SMARTPHONE BUT DOESN'T NEED ANYTHING EXTRAVAGANT.
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I ALREADY OWN A HTC DESIRE X AND JUST GOT A LUMIA 620 24 HRS BACK HERE'S A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO.
      
      
      LUMIA 620
      
      - BUTTERY SMOOTH OS( ALMOST SIMILAR TO IOS)
      
      - GREAT SCREEN
      
      - EXCELLENT SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY
      
      -GOOD CAMERA
      
      -SUPER RESPONSIVE SCREEN
      
      -SPECIAL APPS FOR CAMERA TO ENHANCE USER EXPERIENCE
      
      - SNAPPY PROCESSOR AND GPU
      
      HTC DESIRE X
      
      
      -LAGS NOW AND THEN
      
      -SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY NOT AS GOOD AS LUMIA
      
      - AVERAGE CAMERA
      
      - LACK OF NOKIA LIKE APPS FOR CAMERA.
      
      - UNDER POWERED PROCESSOR AND GPU
      
      
      SOME PEOPLE SIGHT LACK OF APPS ON WINDOWS MARKET PLACE AS THE LIMITING FACTOR. TRUE WINDOWS MARKETPLACE IS JUST EVOLVING, BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T DOWNLOAD MUCH OF APPS.
      
      
      THE ONLY APPS I DOWNLOADED WERE TO OPTIMISE/SPEED UP THE PHONE.
      
      TO GET THE KIND OF PROCESSOR AND GPU AS LUMIA YOU HAVE TO PAY A BOMB FOR HTC PHONES.
      
      
      BASICALLY ANYONE LOOKING FOR A SNAPPY FAST SUPER RESPONSIVE PHONE AND NOT TOO BOTHERED ABOUT TONS OF APPS GO FOR LUMIA 620"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I AM A LOYAL NOKIA USER AND THEREFORE DECIDED TO CHANGE MY MOBILE FROM A 3 YEAR OLD NOKIA 5800 XPRESS MUSIC  TO A NOKIA LUMIA 620.THIS WAS QUITE A BIG UPGRADE FOR ME FROM A SYMBIAN OS MOBILE PHONE TO A WP8 SMARTPHONE.
      
      
      GOT THE PHONE 2 WEEKS BACK FROM FLIPKART AT A VERY GOOD PRICE (NO FREEBIES INCLUDED THOUGH) AND AS ALWAYS, HATS OFF TO FLIPKART FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AND COMPETITIVE PRICING. THE PACKAGE IS A VERY COMPACT BOX.
      
      
      VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE PHONE, OS IS SIMPLY BUTTER SMOOTH, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE 512 MB RAM, BUT IT HASN'T POSED A PROBLEM AS OF NOW. CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD.THE PROCESSOR DOES AN EXTREMELY GOOD JOB.
      
      
      ANDROID PATRONS MIGHT FIND THE APPS AVAILABILITY TO BE LIMITING IN WINDOWS STORE, BUT FOR THE AVERAGE USER LIKE ME, IT IS A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PLATFORM. ALSO, GAMERS MIGHT FIND IT A BIT FRUSTRATING THAT MOST GAMES ARE TO BE PAID FOR.
      
      
      THE BACK PANEL COLOUR CHOICES ARE ALSO VERY ATTRACTIVE.
      
      
      NOKIA SHOULD DEFINETLY WORK ON THE HEADPHONES THAT COME WITH THE BOX, THIS LOVELY PHONE COMES WITH A VERY CHEAP QUALITY HEADPHONES. THIS WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTING TO ME, AS THESE HEADPHONES ARE NOT EQUIPPED WITH EVEN A BASIC VOLUME CONTROL AND CALL ATTENDING FUNCTION. THE HEADPHONES THAT CAME IN THE BOX WITH MY NOKIA 5800 HAD THIS IN THE YEAR 2010 !!
      
      
      THIS PHONE REQUIRES THE USER TO PRUNE THE SIM CARD TO A MICRO SIM SIZE, JUST FOR INFORMATION AND SUPPORTS MICRO SD CARD FOR ADDITIONAL STORAGE.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE A BOLD EXPERIMENTER, GO AHEAD AND CHOOSE THIS WONDERFUL PHONE. WP8 OS HAS PHENOMENAL IMPROVEMENTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS WP 7.5 OR 7.8, IT SUPPORTS BLUETOOTH FILE TRANSFER BETWEEN MOBILES, THE CHOICE OF APPS ARE MORE ETC.
      
      
      I HOPE MY REVIEW WOULD BE USEFUL :)"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I AM HARIDAS NERKAR. MY OLD MOBILE WAS DAMAGED BY MY DAUGHTER. THERE WAS NO OPTION RATHER THAN BUYING NEW PHONE. IN THE CURRENT MOBILE MARKET THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS TO LEAD CONFUSION IN MIND ?WHICH MOBILE TO BUY?. THERE ARE LOTS OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE TOO. TO REDUCE CONFUSION IN MY MIND I HAVE STARTED FILTERING THE OPTIONS, LET FIRST DECIDE WHICH OS -ANDROID, IOS OR WINDOWS. THEN FUNCTIONALITY/FEATURES I NEED AND LASTLY BUDGET I HAVE.
      
      I DROPPED IOS BECAUSE
      
      1) I DON?T WANT TO PLAY/DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM ITUNES.
      
      2) I HAVE LIMITED BUDGET -15K
      
      THEN I COMPARE BETWEEN ANDROID VS WINDOWS. ANDROID BECAME VERY REACH IN ITS APPS. ALSO THERE ARE LOTS OF OPTION/BRANDS AVAILABLE TO BUY MOBILE IN ANDROID. LIKE SAMSUNG, LG, HTC?.ETC.
      
      AFTER RESEARCHING ON ANDROID AND SOME FEEDBACK FROM MY FRIENDS I FOUND ANDROID MOBILES ARE	 BATTERY EATER.
      
      I DON?T WANT TO HAVE MOBILE WHICH NEEDS TO CHARGE FREQUENTLY. BETWEEN I SAW THE AD OF WINDOWS PHONE. I FOUND IT VERY ATTACKING.
      
      I WANTED TO HAVE MOBILE WHICH IS ABLE TO DO BASICS (LIKE CALL, MESSAGE, READ/WRITE EMAILS, INTERNET-3G) TASK EFFECTIVELY. FOUND THAT WP DOES BASIC TASKS VERY EFFICIENTLY. WP IS NOT APP-CENTRIC LIKE ANDROID OR IOS.
      
      BETWEEN THE WINDOWS PHONE - NOKIA LUMIA 620 WAS IN MY BUDGET AND IT ALSO HAS MS OFFICE INSTALLED IN IT SO I DECIDED TO BUY NOKIA LUMIA 620 AND ORDERED IT FROM FLIPKART.
      
      NOW I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND WANTED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW. I AM HAPPY USER OF NOKIA LUMIA. BELOW REVIEW IS BASED ON MY 3 MONTHS HANDS OF EXPERIENCE ON LUMIA 620.
      
      
      THINGS I LIKE:
      
      1. PEOPLE?S HUB: I COULD INTEGRATE ALL CONTACTS FROM ALL MY ACCOUNTS (FACEBOOK, HOTMAIL/OUTLOOK, GOOGLE, LINKEDIN, TWITTER ETC.) INTO SINGLE PLACE CALLED PEOPLE'S HUB.
      
      I HAVE CREATED GROUPS LIKE FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND COLLEAGUES.
      
      I AM ABLE TO GET ALL UPDATES FROM ALL SET ACCOUNTS (LIKE FACEBOOK WALL/TWEETS ETC) IN SINGLE PLACE.
      
      
      
      2. KID'S CORNER: THANKFULLY, WITH KID?S CORNER ON MY NOKIA LUMIA 620 SUCH FEARS ARE NOW A THING OF THE PAST.
      
      KID?S CORNER CREATES A PART OF MY LUMIA THAT GIVES MY DOUGHTER ACCESS TO THE GAMES, APPS, MUSIC AND VIDEOS THAT I?VE ALREADY CHOSEN FOR HER.
      
      EVERYTHING ELSE SUCH AS YOUR START SCREEN, MY APPS AND MY DATA IS OUT OF BOUNDS BEHIND A PASSWORD. WITH KID?S CORNER I CAN LET MY DAUGHTER PLAY WITH MY LUMIA WITH COMPLETE PEACE OF MIND .
      
      
      3. LIVE TILES: I CAN PIN YOUR FAVORITE WEB PAGES, VIDEOS, ALBUMS, DOCUMENTS, CONTACTS ETC. TO MY HOME SCREEN FOR QUICK ACCESS. ONLY WINDOWS PHONE HAS LIVE TILES, AND ONLY WINDOWS PHONE LETS ME PIN WHAT I LOVE.
      
      
      4. OFFICE &AMP; SKY DRIVE: I CAN RUN MICROSOFT OFFICE APPS LIKE POWERPOINT, EXCEL AND WORD. I START A WORD DOC OR EXCEL SPREADSHEET ON MY COMPUTER, THEN SYNC IT TO SKYDRIVE AS I HEAD OUT THE DOOR. THEN I CAN WRITE OR EDIT SOME MORE ON MY PHONE WITH OFFICE MOBILE. SKYDRIVE MAKES IT A CINCH TO SHARE DOCS AND EDIT THEM WITH ANOTHER PERSON, TOO.
      
      
      5. WALLET: IT IS CONVENIENT, PASSWORD-PROTECTED PLACE WHERE I STORED CREDIT CARD INFO, CLUB MEMBERSHIP INFO AND OTHER SECURE INFO WHICH IS READILY AVAILABLE TO ME IN NEED.
      
      
      6. SKYPE &AMP; LYNC: I CAN MAKE FREE SKYPE TO SKYPE VIDEO AND VOICE CALLS AS WELL AS SEND INSTANT MESSAGES TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY AROUND THE WORLD. USING LYNC I AM ALWAYS CONNECTED TO MY COLLEAGUES. MICROSOFT LYNC IS RUNNING WELL ON MY PHONE.
      
      
      
      6. SIMPLICITY:  I FOUND THIS IS REALLY SIMPLE PHONE WITH GREAT FUNCTIONALITY."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I AM IN SEARCH OF A GOOD PHONE IN AROUND 15K TO 20K AND I FIND LUMIA 620,SAMSUNG GRAND AND HTC DESIRE X
      
      PLZZ CLEAR MY DOUBT THAT WEATHER LUMIA 620 HAS BLUETOOTH FILE SHAREING OR NOT.
      
      AND PLZZ SUGGEST ME THE BEST PHONE AMONG THOSE PLZ ANY ONE HELP ME"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM APRIL, 2013. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU PLAN TO BUY THIS PHONE.
      
      1.  THIS PHONE HAS SOME MEMORY USED AS OTHER STORAGE, WHICH CAN NEITHER ACCESSED BY THE USER NOR YOU CAN DELETE THOSE FILES UNDER OTHER STORAGE HEAD, NOKIA HAS AN APP STORAGE CHECK BUT THAT WILL NOT LET YOU DELETE SOME FILES OF OTHER STORAGE, AS A RESULT A PART OF YOUR PHONE MEMORY WILL BE UNUSED AND IT WILL GROW DAY BY DAY, IN MY CASE THIS IS NOW 980 MB OUT OF 7.2 GB.
      
      
      2.   THE PHONE COMES WITH MICROSOFT'S INTERNET EXPLORER 10, WHICH IS QUITE FAST AND GOOD, BUT IE10 NOT ALLOWS USER TO DOWNLOAD ANY THING OVER INTERNET, YOU CAN NOT DOWNLOAD MUSIC, VIDEOS AND OTHER MULTIMEDIA USING IE10 ON YOUR PHONE OR IT DOWNLOADS BUT YOUR CAN NOT ACCESS THOSE FILES.
      
      
      3.   THE PHONE DOES'NT ALLOW USERS TO INSTALL APPS, GAMES AS WELL AS DOCUMENTS TOO ON THE SD CARD SUPPORTED. ALL THESE THINGS WILL BE INSTALLED ON PHONE MEMORY ONLY.
      
      
      ALL THE FACTS I HAVE WRITTEN ARE ONLY THE NEGATIVES OF THIS PHONE, ANY OTHER AREA NOT MENTIONED HERE, LUMIA 620 PERFORMS OUT OF CLASS. I ALSO INVITES SUGGESTIONS FROM THE FLIPKART FORUM, IF SOMEONE FOUND SOLUTIONS TO THESE THINGS. THANKS."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I BOUGHT LUMIA 620 FROM FLIPKART 4 MONTHS BACK. IT IS MY FIRST SMART PHONE. IM 100% SATISFIED WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND LOOKS. ITS A VERY GOOD CHOICE, I FULLY RECOMMEND YOU TO CHOOSE NOKIA AND WINDOWS MOBILE"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE FROM MARKET AT PRICE OF 12500 ONLY &AMP; THIS IS GREAT PHONE.GREAT FEATURES AT THIS PRICE.SURE, I CAN MAKE EVEN BIGGER LIST GUYS, BUT MY POINT IS SIMPLE, AFTER U USE WP FOR A MONTH OR TWO, IT?S HARD TO GO BACK TO APP-CENTRIC ANDROID.
      
      AT THIS PRICE, NO ANDROID DEVICE CAN PLAY ANY HIGH END GAME ANYWAY APART FROM NORMAL GAMES, FORGET THE RICH UX AND FUNCTIONALITY OF WP.
      
      MANY RESTRICTIONS OF WP7.X ARE REMOVED IN WP8. IT SUPPORTS DRAG AND DROP, NO NEED OF ZUNE OR WINDOWS PHONE APP (IT?S OPTIONAL). BT FILE SHARING IS BUILT IN AND WORKS FLAWLESSLY WITH ANY OTHER DEVICE. KERNEL IS CHANGED TO WINDOWS NT SO THAT APPS ARE EASY TO PORT FROM WINDOWS 8 AND RT. UNITY ENGINE IS SUPPORTED FOR GAMING SO GAMES ARE EASY TO PORT FROM ANDROID AND IOS. EXPECT MANY NEW APPS AND GAMES IN COMING DAYS TO WP8 DUE TO THESE CORE CHANGES.
      
      EXPANDABLE MEMORY IS ADDED. DUAL BAND WIFI IS AVAILABLE ON ALL WP8 LUMIA PHONES. ONLY OTHER DEVICES HAVING IT ARE IPHONE 5, IPAD 4 , GALAXY S3 , NOTE 2 AND IPOD TOUCH 5TH GEN. EVERY OTHER PHONE HAS 2.4 GHZ WIFI WHICH IS SLOWER THAN 5 GHZ BAND."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 1 WEEK BACK AND TRUST ME THIS IS THE BEST PHONE BY NOKIA UNDER 14K RANGE.THE DISPLAY IS AWESOME AND EVEN TO SUPER AMOLED SCREEN.I LOVE WINDOWS BECAUSE OF ITS SEXY UI. RESPONSE OF THIS PHONE IS VERY NICE BECAUSE OF SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR.
      
      AND COLORS I LOVE IT.I GOT LIME GREEN COLOR PHONE AND CAN CHANGE THE PANELS AS WELL AS THEME ALSO.THANK YOU NOKIA."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,I BROUGHT MY LUMIA 620 TWO MONTHS BEFORE.. AND THIS TWO MONTH IM FEELING THE WORLD WITH MY MOBILE.. REALLY THIS IS THE ONLY PHONE.. PLEASE BUY THIS AND ENJOY YOUR WORLD.. DONT HEAR ANY RUMORS FROM YOUR ANDROID FRIENDS. DONT THINK OF BUYING THIS..
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I GOT MY PHONE ON THE 2ND DAY OF ORDERING. DELIVERY IS VERY GOOD.
      
      
      AND THE MOBILE IS ALSO VERY GOOD AND LIKED IT VERY MUCH.
      
      
      ONLY THE PROBLM IS THE NUMBER OF APPS AND GAMES BUT THATS NOT A BIG ISSUE AND WILL SOLVED WITH THE TIME.
      
      AND ONE PRBLM IS I NOT FOUND HOW TO SHARE MUSIC AND VIDEOS VIA BLUETOOTH"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I GOT THIS PHONE RECENTLY. THE EXPERIENCE ON THIS PHONE IS GOOD. I WOULD RANK IT 9.5/10 FOR ITS LOOK. NOKIA STORE AND MICROSOFT HAS GIVEN LOTS OF USEFUL APPS IN APPS STORE. CERTAIN APPS ARE SIMILAR TO ANDROID. THE PHONE DO NOT HANG UNLIKE OTHER SMART PHONES. THE USER INTERFACE IS EXCELLENT, SMOOTH AND THE SCREEN DANCES WITH YOU FINGER MOVEMENT. NO ADDITIONAL DESKTOPS, ONE MAIN SCREEN AND HAVE ALL YOUR SHORTCUTS ON IT, THAT IS LOVELY. THE INTERNET USING WIFI AND 3G ARE GOOD. MUSIC IS SIMPLY MARVELOUS WITH DOLBY STEREO. THOUGH THE REVIEWS SAY THAT THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS LOW, I FELT THE SCREEN CLARITY IS GOOD. THE PHONE IS HANDY AND COMFORTABLE TO HANDLE IN SINGLE HAND UNLIKE THE LATEST TOUCH PHONES WITH BIG SCREEN. FEATURES WHICH I LIKED FOR UNIQUENESS IS:
      
      1)   INTERNAL MEMORY 8GB
      
      2)   NOKIA CITY LENS
      
      3)   BATTERY LIFE
      
      4)   USER FRIENDLY OS WINDOWS 8
      
      5)   RINGTONE MAKER
      
      6)   ALPHABETIC ARRANGED MENU AND PHONE BOOK
      
      7)   BUDGET PHONE WITH ALL FEATURES EQUIVALENT TO A COSTLY SMART PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A SMARTPHONE FOR OVER A WEEK. LUMIA 620 SEEMED TO BE GOOD FROM THE START. XPERIA L WAS ANOTHER OPTION. AS IF FLIPKART HAS READ MY MIND, ON 25TH THERE WAS A HUGE DISCOUNT ON 620 AND ALSO GOT A FREE 16GB MICRO SD FREE..!! THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO THINK ABOUT...I JUST BOUGHT IT THEN AND THERE..!!
      
      
      THE PHONE BUILT IS REALLY GOOD...FEELS SOLID IN HANDS (WELL ATLEAST FOR ME).
      
      
      I'M NEW TO WINDOWS PHONE SO STILL EXPLORING THE PHONE..!!
      
      
      NOKIA CITY LENS, DRIVE PLUS AND MAPS ARE JUST AMAZING.
      
      
      THE HEADSET IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING THOUGH..!! BAD BUILD QUALITY...FEELS CHEAP..AND LISTENING TO MUSIC IS HORRIBLE EVEN WITH THE DOLBY SETTINGS AND EQUALISERS..!!! THAT'S THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I HAD :("
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE NOW FOR MORE THAN 3 MONTHS AND I FOUND IT TO BE A VERY GOOD PHONE. THE BEST PART IS THAT WP8 STORE HAS ALL THE APPS THAT I USE. THE BATTERY COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BETTER, HOWEVER WHEN I FULLY CHARGE IT, IT TAKES A DAY AND A HALF TO GET DRAIN WITH MY MODERATE USES.
      
      OVERALL A NICE WINDOWS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT NOKIA LUMIA 620 2 MONTHS BACK. WHEN I STARTED TO USE IT I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS OPERATING SYSTEM IS FULL OF BUGS, AND NOT ONLY BUGS THERE ARE LOT'S OF FUNCTINALITY MISSING.SOME OF THEM I WILL POINT HERE ELSE BEFORE BUY GO TO THE MICROSOFT COMMUNITY ONCE TO CHECK.
      
      BUGS:
      
      1:- IF YOU COPY MP3 FILES FROM COMPUTER TO THE SD CARD VIA THE DATA CABLE AND WHEN YOU DETACH THE DATA CABLE YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE ARE 3 DUPLICATE COPY OF EACH MP3 FILES CREATED.
      
      2:- IF YOU TRANSFER ANY FILE THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH YOU WILL NOT ABLE TO SEE THE FILE IN THE PHONE.YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THE MOBILE TO COMPUTER AND DIG DEEP INTO THE FOLDER TO FIND IT.
      
      MORE AVAILABLE ON COMMUNITY.
      
      SO I WILL ADVICE ANYONE WHO IS GOING TO BUY ANY WINDOWS PHONE 8 MOBILE PLEASE GO THROUGH THE MICROSOFT COMMUNITY ONCE.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOBILE LIKE ME.
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT ONE MONTH BACK AND FINALLY I HAVE TO SOLD IT AFTER ONE MONTH."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE BEFORE 4 DAYS THROUGH FLIPKART..
      
      BY READING THESE REVIEWS EVERYONE THINKS THAT THIS IS THE BEST PHONE EVER..... BUT THE FACT IS YOU WILL NOT BE SATISFIED AS ANDROID PLATFORM..
      
      FISRT OF ALL NO MANY FREE APPS THAN ANDROID (EVEN ANGRY BIRDS IS PAID)..
      
      WITH OUT  MOBILE DATA YOUR PHONE IS LIKE DEAD..
      
      CAMERA CLARITY IS FAIR AND YOU WIL NOT BE HAVING FILE MANAGER TO VIEW AND MODIFY YOUR FILES.. YOU CAN MAKE VIDEO CALLS THROUGH INTERNET ONLY NOT THROUGH YOUR MOBILE OPERATOR..
      
      THE TOUCH IS AWESOME AND APPS WHICH ARE AVALIABLE FREELY WORKS WITH OUT LAGS.."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT 2 MONTHS AGO, AND I FOUND THAT ITS A GOOD AND REALLY BEAUTIFUL, IF YOU PURCHASE THE GREEN COLOR. I AM A MUSIC LOVER, THE EAR PIECE WHICH YOU WILL GET WITH THIS PRODUCT IS NOT SO GOOD. SO, I WANT TO PURCHASE A NEW HEADPHONE FOR IT. AND I AM CONFUSED TO BUY WHICH WOULD BE BETTER FOR IT. CONFUSED IN CREATIVE, SKULLCANDY, JBL &AMP; SENNHEISER. I WANT A GOOD BASS QUALITY HEADPHONE, SHOULD BE AROUND 500 RS TO 1500 RS. CAN ANYONE SUGGEST A BETTER ONE PLS WHICH MUST HAVE A WORKING MIC AND AUDIO/VOLUME CONTROLS.."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I REALLY LIKE THIS PHONE. OF ALL THE PHONES I HAVE USED TILL DATE THIS ONE MOST LUCKY PHONE. ALTHOUGH THE BATTERY POWER IS SAID TO BE BIT LOW, YOU CAN STILL RUN IT THROUGHOUT THE DAY NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU USE IT. WAY BETTER THAN ANY ANDROID!!!!. HOWEVER I WISH IF THIS PHONE COMES WITH A DUAL SIM OPTION."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I USED TO HAVE AN IPHONE 4 AFTER THAT AN S3 AND NOW THE NOKIA 620. AND FOR THE PRICE, IT IS GREAT. WINDOWS PHONE 8 IS EASY TO USE SMOOOTH AND CLEAR. UNLIKE ANDROID WHICH HAS TONS OF FEATURES AND YOU JUST CAN'T CHOOSE WHAT TO DO.
      
      
      CAMERA ON THIS PHONE IS NOT TO GOOD, BUT STILL, IF YOU CONSIDER THE PRICE AND RELATIVE TO OTHER PHONE IT IS GREAT.
      
      
      DEF. BETTER THAN THE SAMSUNG S3 MINI.
      
      
      WINDOWS PHONE 8 FTW!"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME POINTS THAT STAY OUT FROM ALL THE OTHER PHONES!
      
      PROS:
      
      1) FIRSTLY, IGNORE ALL THE &LT; 5 STAR RATINGS. THIS PHONE IS FLAWLESS. :D
      
      
      2) OFFLINE MAPS AND GPS NAVIGATION (WHOLE INDIA'S MAP CAN BE DOWNLOADED APPROX. 600 MB)
      
      
      3) NOKIA HERE DRIVE IS ONLY TRUE OFFLINE VOICE GUIDED TURN BY TURN NAVIGATION SUITE IN WHOLE WORLD! AND THAT TOO OFFLINE :D :D
      
      
      4) MICROSD CARD. (I HAVE 32GB CLASS 10 CARD, ITS OVERKILL FOR A PHONE I KNOW :P)
      
      
      5) NOKIA MUSIC IS THE BEST MUSIC STORE EVER ! NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW, BUT NOKIA MUSIC HAS ALL THE SONGS IN IT, BOLLYWOOD, HOLLYWOOD, REGIONAL, AND EVEN OLDIES 80S, 90S !
      
      BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING - ALL SONGS ARE ROYALTY FREE TO DOWNLOAD AND CAN BE STORED! SO NO NEED TO BUY A MUSIC CD FROM NOW ON. EVERY NEW SONG THAT GETS RELEASED IS UPDATED :D
      
      
      6) VERY VERY SMOOTH UI, AND USER EXPERIENCE! YES ITS A PRO, BECAUSE ITS BETTER THAN IOS AT THIS POINT! NOT A SINGLE LAG !
      
      
      7) NOKIA CLEARBLACK.
      
      
      8) UNIFIED ACCOUNT INTEGRATION! ALL ACCOUNTS FACEBOOK, TWITTER, MICROSOFT (LIVE) ARE INTEGRATED AS ONE. EVEN GOOGLE MAIL IS TIGHTLY INTEGRATED IN WINDOWS PHONE 8, TALK ABOUT NEW FEATURES IN IOS 5 LOL !!! ITS THERE IN WINDOWS PHONE 8 PRELOADED :D
      
      
      9) CAMERA IS VERY GOOD AT THIS PRICE RANGE IM RATHER SURPRISED AT THE FEATURES !
      
      - DIFFERENT TYPE OF LENSES PANORAMA, MULTIPLE SHOTS (BURST MODE), FACE DETECTION, AUTO FOCUS WITH TOUCH (ADJUSTS LIGHT ON A PARTICULAR OBJECT WHEN TOUCHED) CALLED ""SMART SHOOT""
      
      - CAMERA CAN BE LAUNCHED EVEN WHEN THE PHONE IS LOCKED (THATS A NIFTY FEATURE !)
      
      - ""CINEMAGRAPH"" IS A VERY ARTISTIC FEATURE AND ONLY IN NOKIA CURRENTLY, CANT EXPLAIN IT HERE BUT IF YOU EVER WANTED TO CREATE A STATIC PICTURE OF A WATERFALL WHERE ONLY WATER IS MOVING ?? :D :D THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE TECHNOLOGY.
      
      
      10) OFFICE INTEGRATED. (IM A BUSINESS USER SO ITS A HIGH REQUIREMENT)
      
      
      11) DUAL BAND WIFI, NFC SUPPORT AND WIFI TETHERING (FEATURES OF A 30-35K PHONE)
      
      
      12) AND FINALLY, DOLBY SURROND SOUND SUPPORT !
      
      
      THERE ARE OTHER FEATURES BUT CURRENTLY CANT REMEMBER, MAYBE OTHER REVIES CAN POINT THEM OUT.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) NOT BUILT FOR HIGH END GAMING, COZ OF 512 MB RAM. OTHERWISE ADRENO 305 (THE SOC GRAPHICS CHIP ON THIS PHONE) IS MORE THAN ENOUGH. BUT WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT WITH A LOW PRICED PHONE? ITS NOT A BAD THING AFTER ALL.
      
      
      2) HEADPHONES THAT COME WITH THE PACKAGE ARE NOT VERY GOOD, BUT FOR AUDIOPHILES LIKE ME, I BOUGHT A SEPERATE HEADPHONE FOR 3K. THEN AGAIN WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A LOW PRICED PHONE :P"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,IT IS A NICE MOBILE COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILE LIKE HTC 8S I LIKED THIS MOBILE AND ALSO FLIPKART HAS A VERY GOOD SHIPPING I THINK IT IS A VERY NICE MOBILE AND IT HAS GOOD PICTURE CLEARITY AND IT HAS NO RADIO BUT DOWNLOADED IT AND IT IS WORKING PROPERLY (PLEASE TELL HOW TO ATTACK PEN DRIVE NOT MEMORY CARD) IF YOU KNEW PLEASE TELL ME {CELL=8095694433}
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"IT IS A NICE PHONE WITH SO MANY FEATURES, VERY FAST, ONE WHO IS USING WINDOWS IN THEIR PC IT IS ULTRA BEST FOR THEM. XBOX GAMINGS- I LOVE IT... THE PRICE IS VERY MUCH AFFORDABLE. THE BATTERY BACK UP IS GOOD.. MY NOKIA LUMIA 620"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"IT IS A NICE PHONE. SHORTER BEZEL ALLOWED PRACTICAL SIZED SCREEN IN A SMALLER BODY. EXCELLENT SCREEN FOR USING IT IN SUNLIGHT AND VIDEO. EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY FOR CALL &AMP; MUSIC WITH SOUND CANCELLING MIKE BUILT IN. PROCESSOR, RAM, BUILT IN MEMORY MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR SEVERAL USEFUL APPLICATIONS (GAMES ARE MEMORY EATER) AND FEW SELECTED GAMES. VERY RESPONSIVE OPERATING SYSTEM. DIDN'T LIKE THE SQUARE TILES BUT IT WORKS FINE. GPS WORKS AMAZINGLY FAST COMPARED TO LUMIA 710. UNLIMITED MUSIC DOWNLOAD FROM NOKIA COMES FREE WITH THIS MODEL. CAMERA IS FINE FOR A MOBILE CAMERA BUT DON'T EXPECT TO BE LIKE IPHONE 4S/5. PANORAMA WORKS REALLY WELL.
      
      
      APP STORE MAY NOT HAVE MILLIONS APP BUT NOKIA AND MICROSOFT TOGETHER SUPPLIED MANY USEFUL APPLICATIONS. WRITE A NOTE OR A LIST ALONG WITH A PICTURE IN ONE NOTE WHICH YOU CAN GET AND EDIT IN WINDOWS, MAC (WEB APP) AND IPAD/IPHONE/IPOD TOUCH. OFFICE WORKS FINE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T PUSH IT WITH LARGE COMPLICATED FILE- IT IS A PHONE. GOOLE MAP WITH OVERLAY WORKS BEST BUT DOWNLOADED NOKIA MAP FOR MY STATE WORKS WITHOUT THE NET CONNECTION. TEST YOURSELF APPS: EFFECTUAL, BOOKMYSHOW, HD SCANNER (PAY), ACROBAT READER, TIMES OF INDIA, CITY LENS, MAKE MY TRIP (WEB), LIVE TRAIN UPDATE - IF YOU NEED MORE FUNCTIONALITY THEN PROBABLY YOU NEED TO CARRY A IPAD OR LAPTOP.
      
      
      BATTERY: SWITCH OFF BACKUP, DATA(2G/3G), WIFI, BLUETOOTH, LOCATION AND SWITCH ON BATTERY SAVER.  SWITCH ON THESE FUNCTION WHEN NEEDED BY KEEPING SETTING ICON ON THE START SCREEN. WITH OCCASIONAL WEB, GPS IT WILL LAST TWO DAYS. ONLY PHONE CALL AND CAMERA LAST THREE -FOUR DAY. FIRST FEW TIMES THE BATTERY NEED TO BE FULLY CHARGED AND DISCHARGED. AFTER FEW THE BATTERY WILL BE IN FULL CAPACITY. TRY TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC, APP THROUGH WIFI IF YOU HAVE ACCESS.
      
      
      OVERALL: EXCELLENT PHONE FOR A REGULAR GUY. FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO TRY TOO MANY THINGS AND TINKERING SHOULD PLUG-IT IN POWER PLUG AND TINKER OR GET A ANDROID (AND DESTROY IT BY ROOTING-:D)"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"IT?S BEEN SOMETIME SINCE NOKIA JOINED HANDS WITH WINDOWS TO COME OUT WITH PHONES HAVING THE WINDOWS OS. THE FIRST SERIES OF PHONES WITH WINDOWS 7 AND 7.5 DIDN?T DO TOO WELL. THERE WERE ISSUES OF EVERY KIND AND NOKIA WAS SLOWLY BUT SURELY MOVING TOWARDS DISASTER. THEN CAME THE WINDOWS 8 SERIES ENABLED PHONES BEGINNING WITH LUMIA 920 AND 820. LUMIA 920 HAS GARNERED GREAT ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WITH ITS SPECS AND PARTICULARLY THE AMAZING CAMERA IT HAS. BUT THE CRITICS WERE STILL OUT SAYING THAT NOKIA NEEDED TO COME OUT WITH AFFORDABLE LUMIA?S FOR MARKETS LIKE INDIA AND CHINA WHICH ARE THE FASTEST GROWING ON THE PLANET.
      
      
      LUMIA 620 IS THE FIRST IN THE RANGE OF THE AFFORDABLE LUMIA HANDSETS. SO WHAT ALL DOES IT HAVE? IF YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT THE BLACK COLOUR, AT FIRST GLANCE YOU WOULD SURELY NOTICE THE COLOURFUL BACK COVER. THIS IS THE FIRST LUMIA HANDSET WHICH COMES WITH CHANGEABLE BACK COVERS (CYAN, LIME GREEN, BLACK, WHITE, MAGENTA, YELLOW). THE SCREEN SIZE IS QUITE HANDY AT 3.81 INCHES. IT PACKS A 5MP PRIMARY CAMERA AND A 1.2 MP SECONDARY CAMERA. THIS CAMERA IS QUITE GOOD FOR THIS PRICE RANGE (RS 14,200) THAT IS IF YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT INDIAN MODELS LIKE MICROMAX, KARBONN ETC LIKE ME. IT PROVIDES YOU ALL THE FEATURES LIKE PANORAMA, FACE DETECTION, MULTIPLE SHOTS, AUTO FOCUS WITH TOUCH ETC.
      
      
      NOW LET?S TALK ABOUT THE WINDOWS OS. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT ITS NEW AND MANY APPLICATIONS WON?T WORK. THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF APPS IN THE WINDOWS STORE IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO ANDROID. YES THE APPS ARE LESS. BUT HOW MANY APPS DO PEOPLE GENERALLY USE? I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER OF APPS IS A HUGE MYTH. IT?S MORE GOT TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IF EVERYONE IS BUYING AN ANDROID AND PEOPLE WANT TO JOIN THE BANDWAGON. ALL THE BASIC APPS LIKE MESSENGERS ETC. ARE PRESENT IN WINDOWS. EACH APP ON THE WINDOWS STORE IS PARTICULARLY CHECKED AND MADE SECURE.
      
      
      AS INDICATED BY TECHNOLOGISTS, WINDOWS OS AND IOS ARE CURRENTLY THE MOST SECURE PLATFORMS ON MOBILE. THERE IS NO LAG AND ALMOST A BUTTERY LIKE FEEL WHILE USING WINDOWS. THE ?LIVE TILES? FEATURE IS QUITE AWESOME AS ONE CAN CUSTOMIZE IT ACCORDING TO HIS / HER REQUIREMENTS. OFFICE 365 ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CREATE THEIR WORD DOCUMENTS OR POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS ON THE GO. THE FACT THAT WINDOWS IS SO LIGHT COMPARED TO ANDROID, THE PROCESSOR MAKES THE USAGE EVEN MORE SMOOTH AND SIMPLE.
      
      
      THE OTHER NOKIA FEATURES LIKE NOKIA DRIVE, CINEMAGRAPH, NOKIA MUSIC, CITY LENS ALL TAKE THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS PHONE TO THE NEXT LEVEL. NOKIA DRIVE LETS YOU DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE MAP OF A PARTICULAR CITY IR COUNTRY IN THE WORLD LETTING YOU USE IT OFFLINE. NOKIA CITY LENS HELPS YOU FIND THE NEAREST RESTAURANT, CINEMA, MALL ETC. EVEN WHILE YOU ARE OFFLINE THROUGH ITS COMPASS FEATURE. NOKIA MUSIC HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST ONLINE STORES FOR ANY KIND OF MUSIC.
      
      
      LET?S LOOK AT SOME OF THE CONS WHICH PEOPLE TALK ABOUT :-
      
      
      1. ONE CAN?T SEND PREDOWNLOADED FILES THROUGH WHATSAPP ? ONE NEEDS TO GO TO THE FILES IN PICTURES OR OTHER MEDIA (VIDEO), HOLD THE BUTTON AND CLICK ?SHARE ON WHATSAPP?
      
      2. WORST GAMES ? YES MOST OF THE GAMES ARE PAID. IF GAMING IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, THIS IS NOT THE PHONE FOR YOU.
      
      3. BATTERY ? YES THE BATTERY IS NOT THAT GREAT. BUT TELL ME WHICH PHONE AT LEAST AT THIS RANGE HAS A VERY GREAT BATTERY. HONESTLY IF ONE USES INTERNET A LOT, THE BATTERY DOES GO DOWN MOST OFTEN THAN NOT ACROSS PHONES.
      
      4. LACK OF GOOD APPS ? YES, WINDOWS HAS LESSER APPS THAN ANDROID. BUT ONE CAN STILL FIND THE BASIC ONES. AND NEW ONES ARE CONTINUOUSLY COMING AS THE PLATFORM EVOLVES.
      
      5. NO MKV FORMAT SUPPORTED ? WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER DOESN?T SUPPORT THE MKV FORMAT CURRENTLY WHICH COULD BE A PROBLEM IN WATCHING VIDEOS
      
      6. NO FILE MANAGER ? HONESTLY ITS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME IN PARTICULAR.
      
      7. NO FM ? THIS WOULD SURELY BE COVERED IN THE NEXT UPDATE. BUT HONESTLY WITH NOKIA MUSIC AND SO MANY SONGS ALREADY ON MY PHONE, WHY WOULD I NEED THE FM?
      
      
      WINDOWS OS HAS AN AMAZING UI AND WITH THE CLEARBACK DISPLAY OF LUMIA 620, THIS IS A KILLER COMBINATION. I AM OF THE OPINION THAT THE CONS AS ARE POINTED OUT WILL SLOWLY BUT SURELY BE COVERED IN THE FUTURE UPDATES OF THE OS.
      
      
      GO FOR THIS ONE FOR THAT EXCLUSIVE FEEL! YOU WON?T BE DISAPPOINTED.."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"ITS A VERY GOOD PHONE.
      
      THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE IS EXCELLENT.
      
      THE GRAPHICS IS VERY GOOD.
      
      BUT WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL WITH BATTERY LIFE.
      
      WE SHOULD ENABLE INTERNET ONLY WHEN NEEDED OTHERWISE IT WILL DRAIN QUICKLY IN 8 HRS.
      
      NOKIA COULD HAVE GIVEN A BETTER HEAD PHONES (IN EAR).
      
      
      AND THE OVERALL SHOPPING EXPERIENCE WITH FLIPKART WAS VERY GOOD.
      
      ORDERED WEDNESDAY AND GOT THE PHONE THE NEXT DAY. FROM MUMBAI TO CHENNAI.
      
      
      VERY GOOD BUY."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"IT'S THE HOTTEST PHONE ON THE MARKET FOR QUITE SOMETIMES. INFACT I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE IT'S STYLE, COLOR, DESIGN, CAMERA, LOOKS - EVERYTHING. NOKIA ALWAYS COMES UP WITH GREAT PHONE AND THIS IS ONE."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"I'VE BEEN USING THIS FOR A MONTH NOW AND I'M EVER MORE CONVINCED THAT LUMIA 620 IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST PHONE FOR THE PRICE POINT. WINDOWS PHONE IS REALLY CONVENIENT TO USE AND THE MINIMALIST DESIGN AND IN-BUILT APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MUSIC AND VIDEO PLAYER, MS OFFICE AND PDF READER MAKE LIFE EASY. I'VE TRIED TO BREAK UP THE REVIEW INTO  THE FOLLOWING SUB-TOPICS. ALSO SINCE SEVERAL OF THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS INVOLVE SIMILAR VIEWS, I'LL KEEP IT SHORT AND TO THE POINT.
      
      
      DESIGN &AMP; BUILD - 5/5
      
      
      IT'S THE BEST-LOOKING PHONE I'VE EVER LAID MY HANDS ON. THE BACK PANEL IS PRETTY STURDY AND HAS A PREMIUM FINISH, FEELS VERY NICE. HOWEVER I FOUND INSERTING THE SIM CARD INTO THE TRAY A BIT OF AN AGONY. I GUESS IT'S SAME WITH ALL THE SMARTPHONES THESE DAYS; MICROSIM.
      
      
      OPERATING SYSTEM - 5/5
      
      
      FAST, FLUID AND DRAMATICALLY BEAUTIFUL, AS MICROSOFT PUTS IT. THE SWANKY START SCREEN IS A REFRESHING CHANGE FROM THE BORING AND UBIQUITOUS ANDROID APP TRAY. YOU CAN MANAGE ALL YOUR ACCOUNTS BE IT GMAIL, FACEBOOK OR TWITTER. ALL IN ONE PLACE AND YOU NEVER NEED TO LOGIN TO YOUR ACCOUNT. THIS STRONG SOCIAL NETWORK INTEGRATION IS ARGUABLY THE BEST PART WINDOWS PHONE 8. ABOUT THE FILE EXPLORER, YOU REALLY DON'T NEED ONE ON WP WHEN YOU HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL HUBS FOR MUSIC, VIDEOS, AND THE LIKES.
      
      
      AND TASK MANAGER? I DON'T GIVE A DAMN. THIS IS WINDOWS PHONE AND IT'S NOT APP-CENTRIC AS ANDROID IS. LAGS? EXTREMELY RARE ONLY WHEN YOU OVERLOAD IT WITH 5-6 SIMULTANEOUS APPS. MULTI-TASKING? QUITE CONVENIENT WITH THE HOME AND BACK BUTTONS.
      
      
      APP STORE - 4/5
      
      
      DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO ANDROID OR IOS, WE ALL KNOW THAT, BUT THE WINDOWS PHONE IS GETTING THERE AND FAST. YOU GET ALMOST ALL ESSENTIAL APPS THAT ARE ON ANDRIOD AS WELL. IT IS TO MENTIONED THAT THE WP STORE IS NOT FILLED TOO MANY CRAPPY APPS THAT ARE OF NO USE (AS IN PLAY SORE). AND EVERY APP COMES AT MUCH SMALLER SIZE THAN AT PLAY STORE WHICH MEANS YOU'LL NEVER NEED YOUR SD CARD TO INSTALL APPS. THE IN-BUILT PHONE MEMORY IS OF ADDED VALUE IN THIS SCENARIO; LOTS OF SPACE.
      
      
      BUT NOKIA MUSIC IS PROVES TO BE SO GOOD. I NO LONGER BROWSE THE WEB FOR MUSIC. FREE OFFLINE MUSIC AS WELL WITH MIX RADIO. THEY'VE GOT ALL THE MUSIC GENRES OUT THERE AND WITH A FAST DATA CONNECTION (OR WIFI) DOWNLOAD IS PRETTY FAST. THE CATEGORIES OF TOP SONGS AND ARTIST BIO ALL AMAZING. LOVE IT!
      
      
      CAMERA - 4.5/5
      
      
      AS WOULD EXPECT FROM NOKIA, PRETTY GOOD AND EVIDENTLY LEADS THE PACK AT THE PRICE RANGE. NOKIA ADDS EVEN MORE VALUE WITH THE CUSTOM LENSES LIKE PANORAMA (WORKS BEAUTIFULLY WELL), SMART SHOOT, BLINK, CINEMAGRAPH ETC.
      
      
      BATTERY - 3.5/5
      
      
      A MINOR GLITCH THERE, ONLY A 1300 MAH CELL? NOKIA SHOULD HAVE REALLY PUT IN A 1500 MAH ONE, CONSIDERING THAT LUMIA 520 HAS A 1430 MAH BATTERY :(
      
      BUT WITH AVERAGE USAGE, THE PHONE LASTS FOR WELL OVER A DAY. HOWEVER GPRS BROWSING SEEMS TO QUICKLY DRAIN THE BATTERY BY A LOT. WIFI WOULD BE A BETTER OPTION. BUT I DON'T THINK MOST SMARTPHONES WILL OFFER A BATTERY BACKUP OF MORE THAN A DAY, SO THERE, THERE.
      
      
      I CAN GO ON FOREVER. BUT ON EVERY OTHER FRONT YOU COULD THINK OF, NOKIA LUMIA STRIKES THE RIGHT NOTES. I'D DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO'S LOOKING AT A PHONE AT THIS PRICE RANGE. I'M NOT ARGUING THAT WP IS BETTER THAN ANDROID OR IOS. IT'S JUST THAT AT THE MID-RANGE MARKET WINDOWS PHONE DEVICES OFFER MUCH BETTER THAN ANDRIOD DEVICES WHICH STRUGGLE TO GIVE YOU A SMOOTH USER EXPERIENCE AS THE FLAGSHIP (30-40K DEVICES). WITH WP, THE PERFORMANCE IS UNIFORM ACROSS ALL DEVICES. COME FLAGSHIP DEVICES I'D BE WISE TO STICK TO ANDROID DEVICES (SAMSUNG, HTC). WINDOWS PHONE IS STILL GROWING AS AN OS AND IT BEGS TO DIFFER FROM THE MAINSTREAM OPERATING SYSTEMS OUT THERE.
      
      
      KUDOS TO NOKIA AND MICROSOFT FOR GIVING US PHENOMINAL BANG FOR THE BUCK."

Nokia Lumia 620,5,"LUMIA 620 IS SUPERB......

      ONLY DRAWBACK ONE CAN SAY HERE IS D LESS NUMBER OF APPS, BUT HEY DEY R COMING AND WE WILL HAVE SOON D BEST APPS."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"MY OLD PHONE HAD MADE MY LIFE MISERABLE. I MEAN IT, TRUST ME, IT WOULD HANG UP ALL THE TIME AND GIVE ME A LOT OF TROUBLE DURING EMERGENCIES. I CHANGED MY OLD SAMSUNG SMARTPHONE FOR GOOD AND FINALLY ?HUNG UP? ON THE BRAND. THE NOKIA LUMIA 620 IS MY NEW CHOICE AND I?M LOVING IT, BECAUSE I FEEL SO CAREFREE NOW! I TOTALLY LOVE THE PHONE FOR ITS WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM. ALL THE FAVOURITE APPS ARE RIGHT ON MY SCREEN. WHETHER IT IS UPDATING MY FACEBOOK STATUS, PLAYING GAMES OR BROWSING UPDATES FROM MY FRIENDS VIA PEOPLEHUB, NOKIA LUMIA 620 MAKES IT ALL VERY EASY. THE PHONE?S CONFIGURATION IS GREAT AND THE MENU IS ARRANGED SO NEATLY ON THE SCREEN THAT I HAVE NO WORRIES FINDING APPS WHEN IN A HURRY.
      
      
      I CAN SAY THAT MY NOKIA LUMIA 620 HAS THE SOLUTION TO EVERYTHING. THE DUAL-CORE 1 GHZ SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR WITH 512 MB RAM JUST KEEPS GOING ON AND ON. IT IS GREAT FUN TO MULTI-TASK AND THE PHONE DOES NOT HANG WHEN I OPEN MULTIPLE APPS AT THE SAME TIME. EARLIER MY PHONE WAS ALMOST USELESS IN SUNLIGHT, BUT THE NOKIA LUMIA 620?S AMAZING 3.8-INCH LCD SCREEN INTEGRATES CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY THAT MAKES STRIKING CONTRASTS CLEARER. THE CRYSTAL CLEAR DISPLAY INCREASES VISIBILITY OF IMAGES EVEN IN SUNLIGHT. I CAN SWIPE EFFORTLESSLY THROUGH IMAGES AND PHOTOGRAPHS THANKS TO THE CAPACITIVE MULTIPOINT-TOUCH SCREEN.
      
      
      NOBODY WOULD ARGUE THAT THE NOKIA LUMIA 620 HAS THE BEST CAMERA AMONG SMARTPHONES. THE REVOLUTIONARY SMARTSHOOT FEATURE OF THE 5 MP CAMERA IS A WINNING TAKEAWAY. WHAT THIS FEATURE DOES IS, IT TAKES MULTIPLE CLICKS AND I CAN PICK AND CHOSE TO COMPOSE THE PERFECT SNAP. THAT?S NOT ALL, THE AMAZING CINEMAGRAPH FEATURE LETS ME ANIMATE MY SNAPS THE WAY I WANT! CONNECTIVITY WORRIES TOO ARE HISTORY. NOW I CAN VIDEO CHAT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND AS LONG AS I WISH, THANKS TO THE NOKIA LUMIA 620?S 3G SUPPORT AND THE FRONT CAMERA. WHEN IT COMES TO EXCHANGING DATA, THE PHONE ALSO OFFERS GREAT HELP WITH NFC, WI-FI, BLUETOOTH, WLAN AND MICROUSB. ALL THE DATA CAN BE STORED EASILY ON MY NOKIA LUMIA 620 WITH THE 8 GB INTEGRATED MEMORY AND AN ADDITIONAL 7 GB OF STORAGE SPACE ON SKYDRIVE.
      
      
      I?M SERIOUSLY SO HAPPY WITH MY NEW PHONE BECAUSE I HAVE NO MORE BATTERY-DRAINED-SO-WE-WILL-TALK-LATER MOMENTS! THE PHONE IS QUITE ENERGY EFFICIENT THE PHONE?S REMOVABLE BATTERY OFFERS UP TO 14.6 HRS OF 2G TALK TIME AND APPROX. 10 HRS OF 3G TALK TIME. NOW THAT?S JUST SO COOL FOR A SMARTPHONE! IN THE LOOKS SECTION TOO, MY NOKIA LUMIA 620 SCORES A DEFINITE HIGH OVER MY OLD PHONE. I JUST LOVE THE VIBRANT DUAL-SHOT SHELLS THAT ARE A REFRESHING BREAK FROM BORING GREY AND BLACKS. ALONG WITH STYLE AND A SLEEK DESIGN, I BELIEVE MY NOKIA LUMIA 620 COMPLETES THE LIST OF MUST-HAVES IN A SMARTPHONE AND MAKES ME THE PROUD OWNER OF ONE TOO!"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"NOKIA LUMIA 620 IN AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT IN ITS RANGE.. I WAS USING ANDROID FOR LAST 3 YRS &AMP; OPTED THIS PRODUCT FOR CHANGE ONLY &AMP; AFTER OWNING THIS PRODUCT I MUST SAY THAT THERE ARE LOT OF RUMOURS ABOUT WINDOWS PHONE IN MARKET.

Nokia Lumia 620,5,"NOTHING TO SAY MORE, JUST FEW WORDS. THIS PHONE IS AWESOME, FAST, EASY TO USE. IF YOU LIKE FEW ANDROID GAMES THEN THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR YOU.
      
      
      EXCEPT THIS WINDOWS PHONE IS FAR MORE BETTER THAN ANDROID PHONES OF SAME RANGE."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"ONE OF THE BEST PHONE IN THE MARKET. DEFINETLY PEOPLE WILL GET BIT LESS APPS IN COMPARISON TO ANDROID BUT I AM SURE ONCE YOU WILL USE A WP8 THEN DEFINITELY YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT. WORKING IS VERY SMOOTH. TOUCH IS VERY GOOD. NOKIA 620 IS A AFFORDABLE PHONE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS USER.
      
      
      I TOOK IT JUST AFTER LAUNCHING IN INDIA. IT IS AWESOME.
      
      
      THANKS
      
      ROHIT"
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"PROS :
      
      1. WINDOWS 8: A WELCOME CHANGE FROM ANDROID. LIVE TILES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND APPS ARE SECURE. NO NONSENSE.
      
      2. NFC: AS A DEVELOPER, I WANTED TO TRY MY HANDS ON NFC.
      
      3. NOKIA APPS : HERE MAPS, HERE DRIVE PLUS, NOKIA MUSIC AND MANY MORE LIKE CITY LENS. YES YOU CAN HAVE OFFLINE MAPS, SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SWITCH ON YOUR 2G / 3G WHILE ON ROAMING.
      
      4. GOOD DISPLAY: YOU CAN USE IT UNDER DIRECT SUNLIGHT.
      
      5. PRICE / PERFORMANCE : I DIDN'T SEE IT LAG EVEN ONCE AFTER 2 WEEKS OF USAGE. AT THIS PRICE YOU GET THE RELIABILITY OF NOKIA.
      
      6. SAR: VERY LOW SPECIFIC ABSORPTION RATE, CAUSES LESS HARM TO BODY.
      
      7. MICROSOFT APPS: OFFICE / ONE NOTE / OUTLOOK AND SKYDRIVE, OFFICE 365 FOR FREE !
      
      8 GLONASS: THIS IS AN ALTERNATE TO US GPS AND AVAILABLE ON SNAPDRAGON CHIP ( ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT IF THERE IS ANY CONFIGURATION AVAILABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN GPS / GLONASS, ITS QUITE QUICK TO FIND MY LOCATION)
      
      
      NOTHING IS PERFECT AND A REVIEW WITHOUT CONS LOOKS INCOMPLETE :)
      
      CONS:
      
      1. NO GORILLA GLASS: ALTHOUGH THE GLASS IS TOUGHENED, ITS NOT A GORILLA GLASS. YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND KEEP IT SAFE FROM COINS / KEYS AND OTHER METAL OBJECTS. SO FAR I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO. :)
      
      2. NO FM: ALTHOUGH IT WAS NEVER A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME, SOME PEOPLE WOULD MISS IT.
      
      3. PRONE TO FINGER PRINTS (THINKING OF TRYING TO PUT A SCREEN GUARD AND SEE IF IT HELPS)"

Nokia Lumia 620,5,"PRO'S:
      
      1. WINDOWS 8 OS.
      
      2. LOOKS, THE SCREEN AND ITS CLARITY.
      
      3. NOKIA MUSIC. IT'S SIMPLY BRILLIANT. THE BEST MUSIC APP OUT THERE. COMBINED WITH A 3G CONNECTION, ANY SONG CAN EASILY BE SEARCHED, AND DOWNLOADED IN UNDER 10 SECONDS.
      
      4. NOKIA DRIVE (NOW KNOWN AS HERE DRIVE) AND NOKIA CITY LENS (NOW HERE CITY LENS).
      
      5. THE COLOR OF THE TILES CAN BE CHANGED. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO STICK WITH SINGLE COLOURED TILES THROUGHOUT.
      
      6. LOW SAR VALUE.
      
      
      CON'S:
      
      1. WITH A LOT OF DOWNLOADING, BATTERY DOESN'T LAST TOO LONG. NO COMPLAINS THOUGH!
      
      2. NO TEMPLE RUN. BUT THAT'S FINE.
      
      3. NO GOOGLE CHROME APP. BUT INTERNET EXPLORER 10 IS GOOD.
      
      4. NO GOOD ANTIVIRUS OR MOBILE SECURITY APP. BUT I DOUBT THAT'S NEEDED, CONSIDERING WINDOWS IS PRETTY SAFE!
      
      5. IF YOU OVERLOAD THE PHONE WITH A LOT OF MULTITASKING, THERE WILL BE AN OCCASIONAL HANG.
      
      
      VERDICT:
      
      1. PRO'S OUTWEIGH THE CON'S.
      
      2. BEST IN CLASS."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"RECENTLY I PURCHASED THE NEW NOKIA LUMIA 620 AND EVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN AWE OF IT. IT?S ONE OF THE CUTEST SMARTPHONES I HAVE PURCHASED TILL DATE.

LIKE ITS SIBLINGS, IT COMES WITH INTERCHANGEABLE MATTE AND GLOSSY, BOLD AND BRIGHT COLOURED REAR COVERS IN LIME GREEN, ORANGE, MAGENTA, YELLOW, CYAN, WHITE AND BLACK. NOW I CAN USE WHICHEVER COVER I WANT, THAT BEST GOES WITH MY STYLE AND MOOD.
      
      
      IT FITS WELL IN MY HAND AT JUST 115.4 X 61.1 X 11 MM AND THE ROUNDED CORNERS AND SIDES MAKE IT EASY TO USE IT WITH JUST ONE HAND. MY LUMIA 620 OFFERS A 3.8-INCH TFT CAPACITIVE TOUCHSCREEN AND A PIXEL DENSITY OF 246 PPI THAT RENDERS VIDEOS IN SPARKLING 16M COLOURS. WITH THE ALL NEW CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY, I CAN VIEW VIDEOS AND MOVIES IN HIGH CONTRAST AND ACHIEVE ENHANCED READABILITY EVEN IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT. THE TOUCHSCREEN IS VERY RESPONSIVE AND EVEN RESPONDS TO THE MERE BRUSH OF MY FINGERS.
      
      
      MY NOKIA LUMIA 620 HAS A 5 MP AUTOFOCUS CAMERA WITH LED FLASH AND CAPTURES SOME BREATHTAKING PICS. RIGGED WITH SOME COOL FEATURES, THE CAMERA IS EVEN MORE APPEALING. THE CINEMAGRAPH FEATURE LETS ME ANIMATE MY PICS, THUS BREATHING LIFE INTO THEM. I CAN ANIMATE THEM MY OWN WAY, MAKING THEM LOOK GOOD OR EVEN HILARIOUS AT TIMES AND WITH A SNAP OF A FINGER SHARE THEM ON ANY SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE AND LET MY PALS KNOW WHAT I AM UP TO. ANOTHER COOL FEATURE IS SMARTSHOOT THAT LETS ME TAKE A STREAM OF PHOTOS WITH JUST ONE CLICK. SO, WHEN SHOOTING A GROUP I NEED NOT PAY ATTENTION IF ALL ARE COMING OFF WELL, AS I CAN GO ON CLICKING AND LATER INTEGRATE THEM TO MAKE THE SNAP THAT BEST SUITS ME. WITH THE HELP OF THE HERE CITY LENS APP, I CAN HOLD THE PHONE UP TO SCAN THE SURROUNDINGS AND IT USES THE REAR CAMERA TO REVEAL THE NEARBY PLACES.

      NOT GOOD FOR CONTINUOUS GAMING OR WATCHING VIDEOS."
Nokia Lumia 620,5,"THE LUMIA SERIES OF SMARTPHONES FROM NOKIA HAS SET THE COMPETITION STRAIGHT BY INTRODUCING SOME MIND-BOGGLING FEATURES. CONSIDERING THIS, IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT I WOULD OPT FOR A NOKIA LUMIA. I CHOSE THE LUMIA 620 AS IT WAS RIGHT IN MY BUDGET AND HAS JUST THE RIGHT SET OF FEATURES. DESIGNED TO LAST AND TO IMPRESS, MY LUMIA 620 CAME IN A HARD PLASTIC OVER THAT LOOKS BRIGHT AND VIBRANT IN ITS YELLOW COLOUR. THE COLOUR AND FINISH IS SUCH A REFRESHING BREAK AWAY FROM THE STEREOTYPES IN THE MARKET. I HAVE EVEN BOUGHT A FEW INTERCHANGEABLE BACK COVERS TO SUIT MY MOOD AND TASTES. COMPACT IN SIZE, IT RESIDES EASILY IN MY POCKET AND IS HANDY TOO.

WITH AUTOFOCUS CAPABILITIES AND A SLEW OF DIGITAL LENSES, MY PHOTOS COME OUT JUST PERFECT. THE SMARTSHOOT DIGITAL LENS CLICKS MULTIPLE SNAPS OF A SUBJECT AND THEN ALLOWS ME TO MODIFY BITS AND PIECES OF THE IMAGE TO CREATE THE PERFECT SNAP. THIS MEANS I DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR EVERYONE TO GET IN LINE AND GIVE PERFECT EXPRESSIONS WHEN COMPOSING A GROUP SHOT. WITH CINEMAGRAPH, I CAN ANIMATE STILL IMAGES TO GIVE FUNNY EXPRESSIONS TO THE SUBJECTS IN THE PHOTO, A FEATURE THAT HAS MY FRIENDS IN SPLITS AND EARNS ME MANY LIKES AND COMMENTS ON SOCIAL NETWORKS.
      
      
      WITH SNS INTEGRATION AND LIVE TILES, ALL MY SOCIAL NETWORKING UPDATES ARE DIRECTLY AVAILABLE ON MY HOME SCREEN AND I DO NOT NEED TO NAVIGATE DEEP INTO THE PROFILES OF MY PALS. USING PEOPLEHUB, I CAN TAG ALL MY FREQUENT CONTACTS TO THE HOME SCREEN AND ENJOY DYNAMIC STATUS UPDATES. ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE DUE TO THE INTEGRATED WINDOWS 8 OPERATING PLATFORM. POWERED BY A 1 GHZ DUAL-CORE SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR AND 512 MB RAM, MY LUMIA 620 ZIPS THROUGH ALL MY DAILY TASKS WITH EXCEPTIONAL EASE. THERE IS LITERALLY NO HANG TIME OR DELAY BETWEEN SWITCHING APPLICATIONS OR EVEN WHEN PLAYING HD GAMES. THE BATTERY BACKUP OF MY PHONE IS GREAT TOO, SO I DO NOT NEED TO FIND A CHARGING POINT FREQUENTLY.

Nokia Lumia 620,5,"THE PHONE IS SIMPLY AWESOME...
      
      
      IN ALL THE REVIEWS II READ ABOUT THIS PHONE, THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE THAT WAS LISTED IS THE LIMITATION OF APPS.
      
      
      I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS NOT A LIMITATION AT ALL SINCE THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF WINDOWS APPS AVAILABLE IN THE STORE AND SOME AMAZING APPS COME FREE. I DIDN'T FIND THIS A CONSTRAINT AT ALL.

Nokia Lumia 620,4,"BEST PHONE UNDER 15K, SINCE I HAVE NOT USED ANDROID, THIS WINDOWS PHONE LOOKS GREAT TO ME....... IF U ARE A NON -ANDROID USER, SIMPLY GO FOR IT.. IF NOKIA ADDS FM IN THE FORTHCOMING OS UPDATE, THIS WILL BE A HEAVY COMPETITOR IN THE MARKET.. I AM USING IT FOR 2 WEEKS NOW.... I ACCEPT ITS REALLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND ITS NAVIGATION, BUT ONCE U GET USED TO IT... ITS AWESOME.... BATTERY BACK UP IS BEARABLE...AND GUYS, U CANT SHARE THE VIDEO CLIPS VIA BLUE TOOTH, HOWEVER U CAN SHARE THE VIDEOS, WHICH U TAKE IN UR CAMERA...... WORTH BUY UNDER 15K...."

Nokia Lumia 620,4,"EXCELLENT FOR 15K, NICE BUILT, GOOD LOOKS EVRYTHING IS FINE. BUT I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE BATTERY LIFE. I DONT USE IT MUCH BUT AS WOULD SAY, I CHARGED IT TO 100% IN THE MORNING BUT CAME TO 15% IN THE EVNING. BUT THE PERIOD I JUST DID TWO CALLS WHICH LASTED FOR MAX 2MINS AND 3 APPS DOWNLOAD OF AVG 4MB AND TESTED IT FEW TIMES. PEOPLE WHO TRAVELA LOT NOT RECOMMENDED OR WHO IS USAULLY NOT A LONG BATTERY LOVER. OVERALL IT LOVED IT.."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"FIRST OF ALL AWESOME SERVICE AND DELIVERY FROM FLIPKART.
      
      I GOT THIS MOBILE FOR RS. 13394 FROM FLIPKART. ABOUT MOBILE AWESOME PHONE....... AND WINDOWS 8 IS REALLY GREAT. PREVIOUSLY I WAS USING GALAXY POP ANDROID OS BUT AFTER USING THIS MOBILE WINDOWS 8 I DONT WANNA USE ANDROID OS AGAIN. MOBILE SCREEN IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FOR MIDDLE HAND USERS NOT SO BIG  NOT SO SMALL. MAIN THING IS BATTERY BACKUP OF THIS MOBILE IS AWESOME ON FULL 3G NETWORK WITH NORMAL USAGE(3G SURFING, VIDEO SONGS, SOME OF GAMES, WITH SOME CAMERA SHOOTS, SMS ANDPHONE CALLS) IS ABOUT 1 DAY AND ON 2G NETWORK ITS ABOUT 1.5 DAYS. ONCE YOU ADD YOUR EMAIL+FACEBOOK+MICROSOFT+NOKIA ACCOUNTS IN MOBILE THEN FORGET WORRIES ABOUT YOUR ACCOUNTS PASSWORDS AND ALL. PHONE WILL LINKS ALL YOUR CONTACTS WITH THEIR FACEBOOK AND EMAIL ACCOUNTS. ON WINDOWS 8 ALL ARE ORIGINAL AND TRUSTED COMPANY APPS ARE THERE, NO FAKE APPS. ALL YOUR INFORMATION ARE SAFE IN YOUR MOBILE EVEN YOUR CREDIT CARD NO. AND CREDIT CARD PASSWORD. IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A HIGH GRAPHICAL GAMES ON THIS MOBILE THEN THIS MOBILE IS NOT MEANT FOR YOU. THIS MOBILE CAN HANDLE ASPHALT 7 HEAT GAME BT THIS GAME IS PAID BT WINDOWS PROVIDE TRY VERSION FOR ALL THEIR PAID GAMES AND APPS. IN THIS MOBILE YOU GET OFFLINE MAPS AND TURN BY TURN NAVIGATION. IN THIS MOBILE YOU CAN ALSO GET NOKIA MUSIC UNLIMITED MUSIC DOWNLOAD AND LISTENING FOR LIFETIME. THAT'S ALL ABOUT MOBILE AND ALL.

Nokia Lumia 620,4,"GOOD PHONE, IF YOU ARE BORED WITH ANDROID OR IOS. APART FROM LESS NUMBER OF APPS IN THE STORE, THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS WORTH MENTIONING:
      
      1. NO EASY WAY (AS IN ANDROID OR IOS) TO SWITCH ON/OFF WIFI, BLUETOOTH, ETC.
      
      2. NO SWYPE KEYBOARD. SHOULD MANAGE WITH THE DEFAULT KEYBOARD ONLY. (THAT IS ALSO OK, NOT GREAT AS SWYPE FOR ANDOID).

Nokia Lumia 620,4,"HI GUYS,
      
      
      PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU BUY ANY NOKIA PHONE UNDER LUMIA SERIES. EVERYTHING LOOKED FINE UNTIL I FOUND THAT THERE IS NO FM IN MY NEW LUMIA 520. I RESEARCHED OVER INTERNET, CHECKED THE MANUAL AND FINALLY THE OUTCOME: MICROSOFT DOES NOT SUPPORT FM.
      
      
      SO THE ENTIRE NOKIA LUMIA SERIES DOES NOT HAVE FM RADIO.
      
      
      NO DOUBT PHONE LOOKS DECENT. AND SCREEN IS ALSO NICE TO TOUCH BUT WE INDIANS JUST LOVE MUSIC AND IF THERE IS NO FM IN THE PHONE. IT'S NOT MORE THAN SCRAP FOR ME. WHAT ELSE, NOKIA SUCKS.
      
      
      LET ME KNOW IF I HAVE SAVED YOUR MONEY..
      
      
      REGARDS,

Nokia Lumia 620,4,"HIII GUYS ....BOUGHT THIS PHONE FEW DAYS BACK...LOVE THE DISPLAY...GOOD SCREEN SIZE NEITHER VERY LARGE NOR SMALL PERFECT..GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH WINDOW 8 OS..VERY GOOD TOUCH SENSE..CAMERA IS GOOD..OVERALL GOOD BUY...
      
      CONS...BATTERY IS SLIGHT LOW"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"HIII LUMIA FANS.. AFTER SEEING THE SPECIFICATIONS &AMP; REVIEWS OF LUMIA 620, I ORDERED THIS PHONE AND GOT IT 3 DAYS BACK.. ITS REALLY AWESOME REGARDING, CLEAR BLACK DISPLAY, REFRESHING WINDOWS UI, TOUCH SENSITIVITY, QUICK RESPONSE, ACCOUNTS INTEGRATION, DOUBLE SHOT COLOR SHELL, SKYPE VIDEO CALLING, CAMERA LENSES ETC.. BT..
      
      
      FROM MY EXPERIENCE, I NOTICED SOME DRAWBACKS IN THIS PHONE, IF THERE ARE ANY SOLUTIONS PLEASE SUGGEST :
      
      
      # BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY POOR, AND EARPHONES PROVIDED ARE VERY BAD AND DISAPPOINTING.. (PHONE HAS DOLBY ENHANCEMENTS WITHOUT GOOD EARPHONES)
      
      
      # ALL HARDWARE FEATURES ARE DAMN GOOD BUT I FELT BASIC NEEDS OF PHONE ARE MISSING REGARDING WINDOWS OS.
      
      
      # ITS NOT QUITE EASY TO GET INTO CONTACTS TO MAKE A CALL..
      
      
      # THERE IS NO PROPER CALL LOG (CALLS TO SAME CONTACT ARE BEING LISTED SEPARATELY WHICH IS IRRITATING), NO CALL DURATION..
      
      
      # WHEN I CREATE A NEW MESSAGE, THERE IS NO RECENT MESSAGE RECEPIENTS LIST/CALL LOG/FAVOURITES TO SEND THE MESSAGE.. EVERY TIME WE SHUD GO THROUGH THE WHOLE CONTACTS..
      
      
      # THERE IS NO SYMBOLIC/COLOUR DIFFERENTIATION FOR INCOMING AND OUT GOING CALLS..
      
      
      # THERE IS NO MESSAGE COUNTER, CALL DURATION LOG..
      
      
      # THERE IS NO STOP WATCH OR COUNT DOWN TIMER..
      
      
      # THERE IS NO FM..
      
      
      # I TRANSFERRED SOME UNSUPPORTED FILES VIA BLUETOOTH, I READ IN REVIEWS THAT THERE IS NO FILE BROWSER IN WP, FROM WHICH I THOUGHT THOSE FILES ARE NOT VISIBLE IN PHONE BUT CAN BE BROWSED BY CONNECTING TO PC. UNFORTUNATELY, I COULDNT FIND THOSE FILES ANYWHERE WHICH IS A MAJOR DRAWBACK..
      
      
      I KNOW, THESE ARE NOT BIG ISSUES BT HOPE WINDOWS WOULD ALSO FIX SUCH ISSUES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR ALMOST A MONTH NOW. THE VISUAL LOOK IS IMPRESSIVE AND THE HARDWARE IS STURDY.

      GOOD OS

      SOMETIMES THE RESPONSE IS SLOW
      
      
      OVERALL GOOD PHONE WORTH BUYING AT THIS PRICE RANGE."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I BOUGHT LUMIA 620 TWO WEEKS BEFORE AND ITS QUITE SATISFACTORY IN DISPLAY/RESOLUTION, SOUND AND VIDEO QUALITY EXCEPT SOME FEATURES THAT I FOUND MISSING WHICH IS PROBABLY NEEDS AN UPDATE FROM WINDOWS SIDE:
      
      1. INTEGRATED VIDEO PLAYER IS VERY DISAPPOINTING, FOUND NO SONG SEARCH OPTION, NEXT/PREVIOUS OPTION ON SCREEN, WE CANNOT RENAME ANY FILE, NO FULL SCREEN OR MULTI TOUCH ZOOMING OPTION.
      
      2. WE CANNOT SELECT MULTIPLE FILE/SONGS TO SEND OVER BLUETOOTH.
      
      3. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING IN BACKGROUND DOING SOMETHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME. YOU HAVE TO STAY ON THE PAGE.
      
      4. LACK OF FREE GAMES IN THE MARKET."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I BOUGHT THE PHONE A WEEK BACK..LUMIA 620 IS THE BEST IN TERMS OF SPEED  &AMP; MULTIPLE PROCESSING. AND WORTH ITS COST.
      
      I HAVE NO COMPLAINS ABOUT ANY OF ITS FUNCTIONS, BUT ITS HEAD PHONES ARE NOT AS PROMISING AS THE PHONE....
      
      IN TERMS OF GAMES &AMP; APPS , WINDOWS ARE STILL LONG WAY BACK...
      
      
      ALL TOGETHER LUMIA 620 IS AWESOME WITH FEW HICCUPS"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I BOUGHT THIS MASTER PIECE ON 5TH MARCH ON PREBOOKING OFFER FROM FLIPKART. BELOW ARE PROS AND CONS.
      
      
      1) APART FROM BUNDLE OF VARIOUS NOKIA APPS WHICH YOU CANNOT FIND ANYWHERE ELSE, YOU HAVE CONTACTS SYNCH UP FEATURE FROM FACEBOOK, GOOGLE AND YAHOO.
      
      
      2) JUST AFTER 2 DAYS OF BUYING IT, I WAS DRIVING ON MY BIKE AND SUDDENLY POTHOLE CAME AND MY NOKIA LUMIA FALL OUT OF MY SHIRT'S POCKET. BELIEVE ME, IT DIDN'T GOT ANY SCRATCH ON THE PLASTIC IT HAD ON BACK SIDE. NO ONE CAN BEAT THAT QUALITY OF PLASTIC.
      
      
      3) 8 GB INTERNAL MEMORY ...OUT OF WHICH 4 GB IS  AVAILABLE FOR USE...AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO INSTALL MANY APPS....ALSO U CAN INSTALL APPS IN YOUR SD CARD AS WELL.
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      1) THOUGH IT'S  NOT MAJOR ONE....FM IS MISSING.
      
      2) BATTERY BACKUP IS NOT LASTING MORE THAN 1 DAY...AND WHEN YOU BROWSE THORUGH INTERNET OR PLAY GAMES, IT WILL NOT LAST MORE THAN 4-5 HOURS OR SO.."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE FEW DAYS BACK.FLIPKART SURVICE IS NICE. WHILE COMING TO PHONE NICE SMART PHONE IN THE REASONABLE COST TO HAVING ALL APPLICATIONS NICELY.WHO EVER BE FEEL TO BE DIFF.GO FOR LUMIA TO USE WINDOWS MOBILE.NOTHING BE WORRY ALL THINGS BE THERE TO DO SAFELY LIKE ANDROID MOBILES. AND THE STORE WHICH GIVEN IN THIS MOBILE IS VERY NICE TO PICK UR LOVLY APPS FOR U R SMART USE.GO FOR IT.
      
      WHEN COMING TO BATTERY BACK UP, ITS ALSO NICE. WHEN UR USING 3G DATA U FEEL BATTERY BACK UP SOME WHAT LESS BT ITS NOT THAT MUCH PROB."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE NET. AND THANKS TO FLIPKART, THE DECISION WAS A LITTLE EASIER. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A NOKIA FAN AND I TRULY BELIEVED THAT SOMEDAY NOKIA WILL SURELY COME BACK IN THE RACE AND WALA WITH LUMIA 620 IT DID JUST THAT. THE PHONE HAS VERY LITTLE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHICH I'LL MENTION IN A BIT. THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THE PHONE, AWESOME DISPLAY, SUPERB BUILD QUALITY WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE NOKIA'S SIGNATURE, THE DURABILITY. QUALITY OF MATERIALS USED INCLUDING THE HARDWARE INSIDE LIKE THE PROCESSOR ETC. THEY NEVER GO CHEAP AND HENCE THEIR PHONES LAST LONG UNLIKE OTHERS.
      
      
      THE BEST I LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE SO FAR IN THE LAST 2 DAYS ARE THE WINDOWS 8 INTERFACE, THE LIVE TILES, THE NO CONFUSING SCREENS LIKE ANDROID ( IF IT'S YOUR FIRST SMART PHONE LIKE ME).
      
      
      NOKIA MUSIC IS FREE AND UNLIMITED, YOU CAN EITHER SEARCH FOR YOUR FAVORITES AND DOWNLOAD INDIVIDUALLY OR USE ONE OF THE RADIO MIXES, NOW WITH THE RADIO MIX YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE TRACKS AND EVEN LISTEN TO THEM OFFLINE.
      
      
      NOW ON THE FLIP SIDE. FEW THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR.
      
      
      1. APP SELECTION ISN'T HUGE, EVEN THE MOST COMMON APPS AND GAMES ARE MISSING.
      
      2. MOST OF THE GOOD APP'S ARE PAID.
      
      3. CAMERA ISN'T GREAT.
      
      3. BATTERY LIFE IS A CONCERN IF YOU'RE USING IT FOR MUSIC OR GAMING, YOU WOULD HAVE TO CHARGE IT TWICE A DAY HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME BATTERY APP'S WHICH CAN HELP YOU WITH THE SETTINGS TO SAVE ON POWER ( SUCH AS BATTERY METER).
      
      
      OVERALL I'M HAPPY WITH THE PHONE AND THERE IS ALSO NEWS THAT MICROSOFT WILL GET THE COMMON APP'S FOR FREE PRETTY SOON. COZ, IF THEY REALLY WANT TO CAPTURE MARKET, THEY SURELY WILL AS THERE IS ALREADY NEWS THAT IN THE MONTH OF MAY GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS 8."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE, NOT FROM FLIPKART THOUGH, ABOUT A MONTH AGO. ITS AWESOME IN EVERY RESPECT. THE FEEL, BUILD QUALITY, DESIGN...
      
      
      THE DISPLAY IS SPECIALLY CLEAR AND CRISP AND THE CAMERA IS VERY SMOOTH AND HAS AMAZING CLARITY. TOUCH RESPONSE VERY SMOOTH FOR A CAPACITIVE TOUCH IN THIS PRICE CATEGORY. THE OPERATING SYSTEM ON THE WHOLE IS VERY SMOOTH. KUDOS TO WP8. THE PHONE IS FAST, SMOOTH AND DOESNT HANG, EVEN WITH ALL THE COMPLEX TRANSITION ANIMATIONS OF WP8 (WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE THE BEST AS COMPARED TO OTHER OS'ES)
      
      
      THE BUTTONS ON THE RIGHT SIDE MAKE IT VERY EASY TO USE WITH ONE HAND. THE SIZE OF THE PHONE IS VERY WELL SUITED FOR USE BY ALMOST ANYONE WITH ONE HAND. THE 620 GIVES REALLY GOOD WIFI SPEEDS DUE TO ITS DUAL BAND WIFI CAPABILITY, WHICH IS EXTREMELY RARE OR NON EXISTENT IN THIS CATEGORY. THE REAR CAMERA IS VERY CLEAR, EVEN IN DARKNESS. PICTURE DETAIL IS VERY WELL  PICKED UP, CONSIDERING ITS A 5MP CAMERA. FRONT CAMERA IS POSSIBLY BEST IN CLASS, OR AT LEAST ONE OF THE BEST.
      
      
      THE 1GHZ DUAL PROCESSOR REALLY MAKES A MARK AND ITS PRESENCE IS DULY NOTED. THE PHONES PERFORMANCE IS VERY GOOD. APPS DO NOT HANG, VERY VERY RARELY CRASH, IF AT ALL. GIVEN ITS CONFIGURATION, IT CAN SUPPORT HEAVY APPS BETTER THAN ANDROID PHONES OF A SIMILAR CAPACITY.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL ITS A GREAT PACKAGE, AND AN OS WHICH TRULY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE LOT. IF ANYONE IS LOOKING FOR A BREAK FROM ANDROID OR IOS OR DONT WANT AN APP DEPENDANT OS, THEY SHOULD CONSIDER WINDOWS PHONE. AND IF THIS ID THE BUDGET, THEN I'D SAY ITS A MUST BUY.
      
      
      BUT, THE ONE CHINK IN ITS ARMOR, AND A PRETTY MAJOR ONE THAT TOO, IS ITS BATTERY LIFE. ITS VERY BAD. CONSERVATIVE USAGE PROVIDES HALF-DAY LASTING OF THE BATTERY. IF USED WITH MAXIMUM FEATURES ON, IT GIVES 8-9 HOURS. THIS IS WHY I GIVE IT A 4/5. ELSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SURE-SHOT 5/5."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I FEEL THIS IS A GREAT DEVICE FOR ITS PRICE AND I AM GOING TO BUY BECUASE OF SOME GOOD REVIEWS
      
      1. 5MP DECENT CAMERA WITH FLASH AND FRONT CAMERA OPTION
      
      2. PHONE LOOKS STURDY AND SOLID
      
      3. DUAL CORE PROCESSOR WIH 512 MB RAM. AS PER REVIEWS FROM PHONEARENA RAM IS SUFFICIENT FOR PERFORMANCE WP8.
      
      4. GOOD PIXEL DENSITY.
      
      
      THE ONLY CON I FEEL IS LACK OF GORILLA GLASS. BUT I HEARD THAT IT IS MADE OF HARDENED GLASS. SO THINK IT IS NOT MUCH OF AN ISSUE.
      
      
      THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE WINDOWS DEVICE AGAINST THIS IS HTC 8S WHICH I BELIEVE IS NOT A GOOD BUY BECAUSE IT IS OVERPRICED AND GIVE YOU THE SAME SPECIFICATION. ONE PLUS POINT WITH 8S IS GORILLA GLASS. BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE A FRONT CAMERA AS WELL."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I HAD MY FIRST HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE WITH THE NOKIA LUMIA 620 WHEN MY FRIEND GOT ONE. JUST WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD IS GOING BERSERK OVER ANDROID, IT COMES LACED WITH THE WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM THAT?S MUCH SPEEDIER AND HAS A MUCH BETTER INTERFACE. ALSO THE DUAL-CORE 1 GHZ SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR AND 512 MB RAM LETS ME ACCESS EVERYTHING EASILY WHILE PROVIDING A SMOOTH MULTITASKING EXPERIENCE. WITH THE LIVE TILES FEATURE, I CAN STAY UPDATED ALL THE TIME AND SINCE I AM SMITTEN BY THE SOCIAL NETWORKING BUG, ALL UPDATES, POST AND COMMENTS ARE READILY AVAILABLE ON THE HOMEPAGE.
      
      
      THANKS TO THE HUMONGOUS 3.8-INCH LCD SCREEN THAT INTEGRATES CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY, THE LUMIA 620 IS LIKE A MINI HOME THEATRE SYSTEM WHERE I CAN WATCH MOVIES ENDLESSLY. THE 5 MP CAMERA LACED WITH THE SMART SHOOT FEATURE IS A HIT. IT LETS ME CHANGE THE EXPRESSIONS AND COMPOSE A PERFECT SHOT! THE CINEMAGRAPH FEATURE LETS ME SELECTIVELY ANIMATE PHOTOS AND THEN POST THEM TO SOCIAL NETWORKS IN JUST A CLICK. ALSO, THE LUMIA 620 COMES WITH 3G SUPPORT AND A FRONT CAMERA, WHICH ENABLES VIDEO CHATTING WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY!"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING LUMIA 800 PAST ONE YEAR AND 620 SINCE 6 MONTHS. IT IS A VERY GOOD PHONE FOR ALL PURPOSE, ESPECIALLY SOCIAL NETWORKING. BUT I LOOSE ALMOST 750 CONTACTS OUT 1250 WHEN TRANSFERRING TO A ANDROID PHONE. LUMIA WILL TAKE ALL THE CONTACTS AS IT IS FROM ANY PHONE EVEN FROM BLACKBERRY BOLD BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TRANSFER CONTACTS FROM LUMIA TO A NON WINDOWS PHONE. EVEN IF YOU TRANSFER THROUGH SOME APPLICATION, YOU WILL GET ONLY ONE OR TWO NUMBERS OF A CONTACT NOT THE FULL DETAILS SUCH AS EMAIL, WEBSITE, HOME AND OFFICE ADDRESS SUCH AS. SO THIS PHONE IS A DRAWBACK FOR PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WHO KEEPS LOTS OF CONTACTS AND DETAILS.
      
      
      IF THIS INFORMATION HELPS YOU PLEASE VOTE FOR RATING. THANK YOU."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR AROUND 15-20 DAYS. IT IS MY SECONDARY PHONE BUT MAN HAS THIS PHONE IMPRESSED ME. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS ONE FOR QUITE A WHILE, AND IT HAS BEEN TOTALLY WORTH IT.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. NEVER HANGS.
      
      2. AMAZING TOUCH RESPONSE.
      
      3. LIVE TILES LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.
      
      4. DISPLAY IS UP TO THE MARK.
      
      5. UI IS PRETTY GOOD.
      
      6. APPS CAN BE PINNED TO START AND ARRANGED AS PER YOUR CHOICE AND REQUIREMENT WITHOUT CAUSING ANY MESS. MORE TILES YOU'VE GOT MORE BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKS.
      
      7. VIBRANT COLOURS TO CHOOSE FROM, AND TRUST ME THEY DON'T LOOK CHEAP. (I'VE A YELLOW)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. 512 RAM SO POPULAR GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN DOESN'T WORK WITH IT YET.
      
      2. THE APP STORE IS NOT AS BIG AS IOS OR GOOGLE STORE. (BUT NEW AND ALTERNATIVE APPS ARE BEING INTRODUCED EVERYDAY)
      
      
      BUT I'LL CHOOSE THIS PHONE OVER ANY ANDROID PHONE UP TO THE RANGE OF 25K."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST 3 MONTHS NOW AND I HAVEN'T FOUND ANY CONCERN REGARDING THE OPERATION OF THE PHONE. THE MUCH HYPED DRAMA BETWEEN WINDOWS AND ANDROID CAN BE PUT TO REST AS THE PHONE HAS COMPLETELY SET ITS STANDARDS HIGH. THE BEST PART IS THE COLOR WHICH LOOKS FUNKY AND STYLISH AT THE SAME TIME. ALL I CAN SAY IS GO FOR IT AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO REGRET IT !!!!!
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 3 WEEKS NOW. MY OBSERVATIONS ARE AS BELOW.
      
      
      PLUS:
      
      QUALITY OF THE HANDSET IS GOOD.
      
      ACCESSING MAILS IS AMAZING.
      
      CAMERA, VOICE CALL, MESSAGING &AMP; MUSIC ARE GOOD.
      
      INTERFACE IS AMAZING.
      
      MONEY'S WORTH.
      
      GOOD BUY, THOUGH A LONG LIST OF MINUSES.
      
      YOU WON'T REGRET.
      
      
      MINUS:
      
      HEADSET QUALITY IS BAD, NO PLUG-INS AND NO ANSWERING KEY.
      
      BATTERY DOESN'T STAND FOR A FULL DAY, IF YOU USE INTERNET THROUGHOUT - BUT THEN THIS IS A SMARTPHONE!
      
      THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS WITH WINDOWS 8 OS, PROBABLY IT'LL GET BETTER - BUT A GOOD ONE FOR A STARTER.
      
      THIS IS NOT LAG-FREE BUT BETTER THAN ANDROID (IN THE SAME RANGE).
      
      WHATSAPP HAS A FEW ISSUES WITH OS, WHICH NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED.
      
      RINGER VOLUME AND MUSIC VOLUME ARE THE SAME - AT TIMES IT IS A PAIN IN THE ASS - ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE WORK!
      
      NOKIA ONLINE SUPPORT IS BAD - FOR EVERY QUERY YOU ASK THEY ASK YOU RESET YOUR PHONE - PATHETIC!
      
      POPULAR GAMES ARE NOT AVAILABLE AS YET.
      
      NO FOLDER ACCESS / FILE MANAGER ACCESS."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND USING IT SINCE LAST ONE WEEK. I HAVEN'T BOUGHT THIS FROM FLIP-KART SINCE IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE LAST WEEK.
      
      HERE IS MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      
      THE PHONE MOSTLY HAS ALL THE FEATURES THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE HIGH-END MODELS LIKE LUMIA 820 &AMP; 920. SUPER SENSITIVE TOUCH FEATURE IS NOT DER BUT THE TOUCH ON THIS DEVICE IS ALSO VERY GOOD.
      
      
      THE BATTERY CAN TAKE YOU THROUGH THE DAY. THE MAX I GOT WAS FOR 13 HRS.
      
      
      THE GAMES LIKE MIRRORS EDGE, NFS HOT-PURSUIT RUNS SMOOTHLY ON THE DEVICE.
      
      
      THERE IS A BUG IN NOKIA MUSIC APP. THE VOLUME ROCKERS MOST OF DOESNT WORK PROPERLY WITH THAT APP. EVEN IF REDUCED THE VOLUME TO 0 STILL THE MUSIC GETS PLAYED LOUDLY. THIS IS A SOFTWARE BUG.
      
      
      SOMETIMES THE LOCK-SCREEN DOESN'T MOVE. YOU WILL NEED TO AGAIN PRESS THE LOCK BUTTON. THIS MOSTLY HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS ANY NOTIFICATION. HOWEVER THE INBUILT SPEECH SYSTEM ALLOWS TO READ NOTIFICATION WITHOUT TOUCHING THE DEVICE. YOU NEED TO ENABLE ONE SETTING FROM THE SPEECH MENU.
      
      
      THE APPS PROVIDED BY NOKIA &AMP; MICROSOFT ARE GREAT.
      
      
      OVERALL ITS A VERY GOOD BUDGET DEVICE. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO INVEST MUCH IN WINDOWS PHONE. THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM ANOTHER ONLINE RETAILER ON 12TH AND IT WAS DELIVERED ON 14TH. I WAS FEELING ECSTATIC WITH JOY AS I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG. HOWEVER, I HAD TO WAIT FOR A DAY TO START USING IT AS I HAD TO GET A MICRO-SIM. BEEN USING IT FOR LAST 3 DAYS. MY OVERALL IMPRESSIONS.
      
      
      1. THE PHONE FEELS 'JUST RIGHT' IN YOUR HANDS.. NOT TOO LARGE NOR TOO SMALL. SAME FOR THE WEIGHT.
      
      2. BRILLIANT DISPLAY, WITH BRIGHTNESS SET TO MAX. BUT DOESN'T HURT YOUR EYES.
      
      3. WINDOWS 8 TAKES SOMETIME TO GET USED TO IT. IT'S NOT 'PLUG AND PLAY'. YOU HAVE TO TAKE TIME TO SET UP THE PHONE IF U WANT THE BEST.
      
      4. BATTERY LIFE WAS A BIT LOWER THAN EXPECTATIONS. IT WENT LESS THAN A DAY WITH FEW CALLS, MESSAGES, DOWNLOADS ETC. INTERNET WAS ALWAYS ON.
      
      5. I TRANSFERRED THE CONTACTS USING 'TRANSFER MY DATA' BUT ONLY A FEW OF MY CONTACTS WERE TRANSFERRED -CAN ANYONE HELP WITH THIS?
      
      6. INDOOR PICS AT NIGHT WITH ROOM LIGHT WERE QUITE POOR, LIKE VGA CAM... OUTDOORS IN DAYLIGHT WAS BRILLIANT. DONT KNOW WHY SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY.
      
      7. THE SPEAKER IN MY HANDSET SOMETIMES GIVES A RUSTLING SOUND, MAYBE AN ISSUE WITH MY SET IN PARTICULAR.
      
      
      OVERALL, I WOULD SAY ITS A VERY GOOD PHONE WHICH GETS EVERYTHING DONE WELL, I JUST WISH IT HAD A BETTER BATTERY LIFE WOULD AND BE A BIT EASIER TO OPERATE! ONE STAR LESS FOR THAT.(IDEALLY I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE 4.5 STARS)"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKARTR ON 11TH AND IT WAS DELIVERED ON 16TH.
      
      . BEEN USING IT FOR LAST 2 DAYS. MY OVERALL IMPRESSIONS.
      
      
      1. THE PHONE FEELS 'JUST RIGHT' IN YOUR HANDS.. NOT TOO LARGE NOR TOO SMALL. SAME FOR THE WEIGHT. IN GENERAL THE PHONE IS GOOD BUT:
      
      2. BATTERY LIFE WAS A BIT LOWER THAN EXPECTATIONS. IT WENT LESS THAN A DAY WITH FEW CALLS, MESSAGES, DOWNLOADS ETC.

Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I HAVE USED MANY PHONES FROM NOKIA. THIS IS THE MOST DELICATE ONE. I BOUGHT THIS JUST 2 WEEK BACK. TODAY MORNING IT FELL FROM MY HANDS AND COMPLETE SCREEN IS GONE NOW. FULL OF CRACKS. TOUCH IS NOT AT ALL WORKING!!! :( I'M WORRIED OF SPENDING 4K MORE TO GET A REPLACEMENT OF THE SCREEN. I HAD A SONY PHONE WHICH WAS MANY TIMES FALLEN DOWN STILL IN GOOD CONDITION. EVEN NOKIA OLD PHONES ARE OF SAME KIND. BUT DON'T CONSIDER TO BUY THIS IF YOU ARE LIKE ME WHO DO A TOUGH TESTING FOR PHONE. THIS IS SUCH A DELICATE DEVICE!!! IT DID NOT SUSTAIN EVEN A 3 FEET DROP. BUT FEATURE WISE, ITS AN AMAZING COMBINATION.. WINDOWS 8 IS SUPERB. IF YOU ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT TOO MANY APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE IN ANDROID OR IPHONE STORE."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I HAVE USED THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND HAVE FINALLY SET TO WRITE A REVIEW. (I DON'T WANT TO BLABBER WITHOUT GETTING MY FACTS STRAIGHT.)
      
      
      LET ME GET TO THE PROS AND CONS.
      
      
      CONS FIRST:
      
      
      1. YOU CANNOT ADJUST THE VOLUME KEY FOR MUSIC, RINGTONE, ETC SEPARATELY. THERE IS ONLY ONE MASTER CONTROLLER WHICH IS ANNOYING AS YOU'LL NEED TO MANUALLY CHANGE IT AFTER LISTENING TO MUSIC TO ADJUST THE SOUND.
      
      
      2. FILE MANAGER: I DON'T THINK THIS IS NECESSARY FOR ME, BUT FOR SOME IT COUNTS.
      
      
      3. YOU CANNOT STORE APPS IN YOUR SD CARD. IT IS INFACT GOOD BUT WHEN MEMORY'S OVER IT GETS A PAIN IN THE NECK.
      
      
      4. YOU MAY THINK ""HOW CAN THE MEMORY BE OVER? THERE'S 8GB!"". FALSE. YOU GET ONLY 5ISH GB AND OF THIS 5ISH, THERE IS THE OTHER STORAGE WHICH CONTINUES EATING SPACE. YOU CANNOT CLEAR IT NOR ACCESS IT. ONLY NOKIA OR WINDOWS MAY KNOW WHAT IT IS USED FOR. THERE IS STORAGE CLEANER APP IN THE STORE, BUT IT IS OF NO USE. MY OTHER STORAGE SHALL HIT 2GB I GUESS IN THE COMING DAYS.
      
      
      5. IT CAN'T PLAY MKV FILES.
      
      
      6. NO RADIO. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT HIS ,BUT OTHERS MAY.
      
      
      7. LACK OF APPS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS ALSO AS I HAVE GOT ALL THE NECESSARY APPS, BUT AS I SAID BEFORE, OTHERS MAY.
      
      
      8. HEATS UP QUICKLY WHILE YOU PLAY GAMES, OR USE WI-FI.
      
      
      9. LOOKS UGLY WHEN COMPARED WITH L520 OR L720.
      
      
      10. I FOUND THE SOFTWARE MALFUNCTIONING. THERE ARE GLITCHES THAT OCCUR, LIKE IT CAN'T IDENTIFY THE HEADSET QUICKLY AND IF IT DOES, THE EXTERNAL SPEAKER WON'T WORK LATER FOR SOME TIME. (THIS HAPPENED TO ME IN WHICH THE EXTERNAL SPEAKER NEVER RESPONDED AND THANKS TO FLIPKART THEY REPLACED THE PRODUCT. KUDOS TO FLIPKART.)
      
      
      11. BATTERY IS NOT ENOUGH. I GET 26-28 HOURS, BUT A HEAVY USER MAY GET AS LESS AS 8 HOURS. THEY COULD HAVE PUT A 1750MAH BATTERY.
      
      
      FOR THE TIME BEING ONLY THIS MUCH.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1. SUPER SMOOTH. 512MB RAM IS PERFECT.
      
      
      2. AWESOME USER INTERFACE.
      
      
      3. INTERNET EXPLORER IS SO FAST.
      
      
      4. LIVE TILES ARE COOL.
      
      
      5. PEOPLE'S HUB. WOW!! IT WAS A PLEASURE SEEING ALL MY CONTACTS TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE.
      
      
      6. EMAIL VIEWING AND LINKING, NO WORDS.
      
      
      7. THE PHONE IS PERFECT IN THE HAND AND LOOKS STUNNING.(TRY TO AVOID A COVER, FOR THE PHONE SHALL LOOK MORE CHUBBY, WHICH IS UGLY.)
      
      
      8. THE PHONE NAMELY L620, AS A PRODUCT OF NOKIA, PROVES ITS NASCENCE. THE HARDWARE IS SO ROBUST. HOLDING IT SHOWS YOU ITS POWER.
      
      
      9. NOKIA MAPS, MUSIC ETC ARE REALLY ESSENTIAL GUYS!
      
      
      10. HD VIDEOS PLAY WITH EASE.
      
      
      11. THE PHONE NEVER HANGS.
      
      
      12. PHOTOSYNTH, A MUST USE CAMERA APP.
      
      
      13. SECONDARY CAMERA IS GOOD FOR SKYPE CALLS.
      
      
      14. ITS NOKIA + MICROSOFT!!!
      
      
      IF YOU ASK ME WHICH MOBILE TO BUY FROM WINDOWS, ANDROIDS, AND IPHONE, I'D SAY GO FOR WINDOWS.
      
      
      IF YOU ASK ME WHICH BUDGET WINDOWS PHONE TO BUY, I'D SAY GO FOR L620.
      
      
      BUT IF YOU WANT LOOKS AND A BIT BETTER CAMERA GO FOR L720 WHICH IS 3.5K HIGHER. NOT SO WORTH, I GUESS.
      
      
      HOPE I WAS OF SOME HELP. :)"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I LOVE NOKIA'S BUILD QUALITY, APPRECIATE THE NOKIA'S COMMITTMENT TOWARDS BUILDING A CLASSY PHONE, BUT WINDOWS8 SUCKS IN PROVIDING MORE OPTIONS. WINDOWS UI IS MINDBLOWING, LOOKS AMAZING  BUT JUS TO DELETE 3 CONTACTS  YOU HAVE TO GO AND DELETE ONE BY ONE WHICH TESTS YOUR PATIENCE  IF YOU ALREADY ENJOYED ANDROID OR IOS FUNCTIONALITIES THEN WINDOWS DISSAPPOINTS YOU. KUDOS TO NOKIA, WINDOWS YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL BUT GROW UP AND GIVE MORE OPTIONS"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I RATE IT ONE OF THE BEST PHONES PROCURED BY NOKIA WITH SUPERB DISPLAY, SUPERB SOUND QUALITY AND VERY ELEGANT LOOK.
      
      
      I WOULD HAVE LOVED IF NOKIA HAS GIVEN FM-RADIO FACILITY TOO. ANYWAYS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH AN APP BUT ON INTERNET COST.
      
      
      NO OTHER CONS AND I AM USING IT SINCE A MONTH."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I REGRET NOT BUYING FROM FLIPKART. THEY ARE SELLING FOR LESS PLUS YOU GET A MEMORY CARD AS WELL. ANYWAYS HERE ARE PROS AND CONS:
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1)REALLY SMOOTH FUNCTIONING WITHOUT ANY LAG
      
      
      2)AWESOME NOKIA APPS LIKE NOKIA MUSIC AND HERE MAPS WITH OFFLINE NAV( PS THE SIZE OF WHOLE MAP OF DELHI IS JUST 70 MB)
      
      
      3)NICE INTERFACE WITH LIVE TILES ( OF COURSE CUZ ITS WINDOWS) AND EASE OF USE ( I ALREADY HAVE SONY LIVE WITH WALKMAN AND 2 OTHER MID RANGE ANDROIDS AND TRUST ME WP8 IS A LOT MORE SIMPLE)
      
      
      4)AMAZING APPS ( YOU GET FULL RANGE OF APPS ONCE YOU SET LOCATION TO USA, NOT INDIA)
      
      
      CONS :
      
      1) NO FM ( ALTHOUGH NOKIA MUSIC MAKES UP FOR IT. STILL IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF FM WAS THERE)
      
      
      2) CAMERA. YES INDOOR PICS ARE TOO BRIGHT AND OVER EXPOSED EVEN ON AUTO FLASH. YOU HAVE TO SWITCH OFF FLASH EVERYTIME BEFORE TAKING INDOOR PICS. HOWEVER OUTDOOR PICS ARE PRETTY NICE SO IS THE VIDEO. AND YEAH SOME LENSES INCLUDING CINEMATOGRAPH ARE PRETTY COOL ALLOWING TO SHOOT ANIMATED PICS.
      
      
      3) RAM : ONLY 512 MB. THAT MEANS SOME APPS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.
      
      
      OVERALL FOR THOSE PISSED WITH ANDROID AND HAVING NO REAL CHOICE, THIS IS THE BEST BUY.
      
      MY RATING : 4/5"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I WAS A SAMSUNG GALAXY Y USER AND HAVE UPGRADED TO LUMIA 620.  THE ONLY THING I MISS HERE ARE THE NO OF APPS THAT I HAD ACCESS TO ON ANDROID. I COULD FIND AN APP FOR ALMOST ANYTHING ON ANDROID WHILE ON WINDOWS, THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE ARE REALLY LIMITED. REST FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE, I FEEL LUMIA 620 IS BETTER THAN ANY ANDROID PHONES (AVAILABLE &LT; RS. 15,000/-).
      
      
      THE SCREEN SIZE IS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD IN YOUR ARMS COMFORTABLY AND AT THE SAME TIME DOES NOT FEEL LIKE HOLDING A NOTE BOOK!  SPECIFICATIONS LIKE 1GZ PROCESSOR, 5MP BACK CAMERA ETC ARE ALREADY PROVIDED ON FLIPKART ITSELF.  THOUGH THE PHONE IS AVAILABLE IN 6 DIFFERENT COLORS, I OPTED FOR BLACK.  I FIND REST OF THE COLORS FEMININE.
      
      
      I COULD CONFIGURE EMAILS AND CHAT APPS VERY EASILY.  THOUGH THE TILES ON THE FRONT SCREEN AT
      
      ARE EASY ON FINGERS, SMS-ING CAN BE IRRITATING HERE AS WELL AS THE BLOCKS ARE TOO SMALL FOR BIG FINGERS.
      
      
      WATCHING MOVIES, LISTENING TO MUSIC ARE ALL SMOOTH EXPERIENCES AND I FOUND 3G TO BE WORKING BETTER ON LUMIA COMPARED TO GALAXY Y.  ALSO THE ""BATTERY SAVER"" OPTION IS A NICE ADDITION.  ALSO ""PANORAMIC"" IMAGE CAPTURE IS A COOL OPTION ON THE LM620.
      
      
      ITS BEEN ONLY TWO DAYS AS OF NOW, AND I SAY LUMIA ROCKS!"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"IF YOU ARE A BATTERY LOVER AND WANT A GOOD BATTERY BACK UP U SHOULD NOT TRY TO AFFORD IT ANY WAYZ A PHONE ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO A PC WOULD EAT YOUR BATTERY SO DON'T HOPE MUCH
      
      
      DONT BUY IF YOU WANT TO GIFT TO OLD PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE THAT MUCH USER FRIENDLY
      
      
      PROS:
      
      WINDOWS8,GOOD TOUCH,AUTOMATIC BRIGHTNESS ADJUST,SCREENSHOT(ALTHOUGH COPIED FROM APPLE :) ),VERY GOOD APPS,NOKIA MUSIC,
      
      
      CONS:
      
      DRAINS QUICKLY IF YOU USE WIFI OR GPS,STUPID HEADSET GIVEN WITH BOX
      
      
      AT LAST :( SO SAD THAT FLIPKART IS NOT SHIPPING TO MY PLACE"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"INITIALLY WAS SKEPTICAL ABT BUYING WINDOWS 8 PHONE ..BUT 1 WEEK AFTER USING IT FEEL LIKE ITWAS A GOOD DECISION..THESE ARE LOADS OF ANDROID PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE BUT ALL LOOK THE SAME BE IT SAMSUNG OR HTC ..IT IS REALLY A REFRESHING PHONE IN THE MARKET
      
      DECENT CAMERA
      
      SMOOTH BROWSING
      
      GOOD CALL QUALITY
      
      NICE KEY BOARD FOR MESSAGING
      
      ONLY LAG IS APPS LOAD A BIT SLOW BUT DECENT ENOUGH
      
      AND A BIT BULKY EVEN THOUGH ITS LIGHT...
      
      ALL IN ALL A DECENT PHONE"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"IT IS AN EXCELLENT PHONE. FLIPKART DELIVERY IS UNMATCHABLE, THANKS TO THEM.
      
      
      I WAS PLANNING TO BUY NOKIA LUMIA 520 BUT WANTED TONHAVE A PHONE WITH FRONT CAMERA AND NFC SO PLANNED FOR THIS ONE AND IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT ME AT ALL AND WAS A WISE DECISION.
      
      
      WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT THIS PHONE
      
      1. PERFECT SIZE, AS I DONT LIKE TOO BIG PHONES WHICH LOOKS UGLY WHEN YOU CARRY THEM IN POCKET. IT HAS THE SAME SIZE AS OF IPHONE.
      
      2. IT HAS GOT BUTTER TOUCH.
      
      3. YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE WINDOWS 8 IN THIS PRICE.
      
      4. I CAN USE COLOUR CASES. I LIKE THE YELLOW ONE.
      
      5. CAMERA QUALITY IS SATISFACTORY.
      
      6. INTERNET BROWSING IS GOOD. I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY LAG.
      
      7. YOU WILL EXPERIENCE DYNAMIC/LIVE ICONS WHICH IS THE SELLING POINT FOR WINDOWS PHONES.
      
      
      WHAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IN THIS PHONE.
      
      1. BATTERY LIFE IS NOT SO GOOD. YOU NEED TO RECHARGE IT ATLEAST ONCE EVERY DAY.
      
      2. APPLICATION CATALOGUE IS NOT AS GOOD AS IOS OR ANDROID.
      
      3. HEADPHONES PROVIDED ALONG WITH THIS PHONE ARE TOO INFERIOR. I DONT KNOW WHAT NOKIA IS UPTO.
      
      4. THERE ARE ONLY TWO HOME SCREENS UNLIKE IOS OR ANDROID WHERE YOU FIND MULTIPLE SCREENS THOUGH IT MAY NOT BE OF MUCH USE.
      
      5. I THINK NOKIA NEEDS TO IMPROVE ON FEATURES LIKE NOTIFICATIONS ETC."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"ITS AN AWESOME PIECE FROM NOKIA, THIS A REVIEW AFTER ONE DAY USAGE. THE ONLY PROB IS APPS INSTEAD. OF THAT THIS IS VERY GOOD MOBILE WITH THE PRICE UNDER 15K. THERE IS A PROBLEM WHILE TYPING ITS LITTLE TOUGH,TO,MOVE THE,CURSOR,CAMERA THE BEST,BY NOKIA IN LOW END"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"ITS BEEN ONE MONTH SINCE I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM NOKIA PRIORITY AND ALSO GOT AN INSURANCE WHICH COVERS THEFT AND PHYSICAL DAMAGE.
      
      
      THINGS I LIKE ABOUT LUMIA 620 -
      
      1. PROCESSOR IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO MULTITASK WITHOUT ANY FLUIDITY LOSS IN SPEED.
      
      2. COLOR PRODUCTION IS EXCELLENT WHEN USED INDOOR AND OUTDOOR. SUNLIGHT READABILITY IS WORKING GREAT.
      
      3. 3G SPEED OF THE PHONE IS GREAT AND IE 10 WORKS FLAWLESSLY.
      
      4. DOES ESSENTIAL DAILY MOBILE TASKS WITHOUT ANY KIND OF SPEED DROPS.
      
      5. FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, LINKEDIN UPDATES ARE BUILT IN INSIDE THE PEOPLE, NOTIFICATION AND MESSAGING APPLICATION. I DIDN'T NEED TO INSTALL ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATION. SYNC WORKS PERFECTLY.
      
      6. STURDY AND AUTHENTIC LOOKS. (NOT LIKE SAMSUNG USING CHEAP PLASTIC AND SILVERY BORDERS EVERYWHERE)
      
      7. TOUCH IS FEATHER SMOOTH. ONE WILL KEEP TOUCHING THE UI FOR HOURS FOR NO REASON. ITS SMOOTH LIKE 'JACK DANIELS'
      
      
      THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE PHONE.
      
      1. BATTERY DRAINS OUT IN A DAY. (IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR ONE DAY)
      
      2. CAMERA IS NOT THAT GREAT. IMAGES DON'T HAVE DETAIL.
      
      3. HEADPHONES PROVIDED ARE HOPELESS. I BOUGHT A SENNHEISER TO ENJOY MY MUSIC COLLECTION.
      
      4. APPS LIBRARY IS VERY LIMITED. (BUT YOU'LL GET ALL BASIC APPS LIKE SKYPE ETC.. )
      
      
      MY RATINGS ARE 4 OUT OF 5.
      
      
      GO FOR IT !"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"I'VE HAD THE PHONE FOR A WEEK NOW.THE SCREEN IS BEAUTIFUL,REALLY BRIGHT AND CRISP,THE WHOLE WP8 INTERFACE LOOKS NICE AND IS A WELCOME CHANGE FROM MY OLD WILFIRES WHICH WAS REALLY LAGGY DUE TO LACK OF INTERNAL MEMORY,THANKFULLY THIS ONE HAS AROUND 5GB USABLE.
      
      IT FEELS GOOD IN YOUR HAND,RIGHT SIZE AND THE PLASTIC FEELS GOOD TOO,THE DUAL SHOT EFFECT IS REALLY NICE,I HAD TO WAIT A WEEK TO GET THE YELLOW ONE,GLAD I DID THOUGH,IT'S THE BEST COLOR ACCORDING TO ME.
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD IN OUTDOORS WHERE AMPLE LIGHT IS AVAILABLE BUT INDOORS THE NOISE LEVELS PICK UP PRETTY SOON,FRONT CAMERA IS OK,
      
      THE PICTURES HAVE GREAT COLOR,BUT COULD HAVE BEEN A TAD SHARPER.
      
      BATTERY LASTED ME A WHOLE DAY WITH WIFI AND DATA ON AND PLAYING GAMES AND SURFING THE WEB,YOU COULD EASILY GET AROUND 1.5 DAYS OUT OF IT WITH MILD USAGE.
      
      OVERALL A GREAT PHONE,BUY IT WITHOUT DOUBTS.

      &GT;NICE LOOKING INTERFACE

      CONS
      
      MOST CONS ARE WITH WP8,ALTHOUGH NOT MAJOR
      
      &GT;NO FILE MANAGER(I DONT NEED IT)
      
      &GT;IF YOU WANT TO SEND A FILE USING BT,IT MUST BE TURNED ON BEFOREHAND ELSE YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE MENU AND DO IT

Nokia Lumia 620,4,"JAN - I NEED A PHONE!!! GOOGLE SEARCH.....620 WITH AN ALL NEW  OS TO BE AVAILABLE SOON
      
      FEB TO APRIL - LONG WAIT FOR IT &AMP; 720.
      
      APRIL - FINALLY BOUGHT LUMIA 620. MY FIRST SMART PHONE.
      
      MAY - MUSIC THAT I LOVE........ TOO DIFIICULT INITIALLY TO HANDLE BECAUSE OF TOO MANY SETTINGS &AMP; TOP OF IT WITH THE WORST EARPHONE I EVER HAD... SEARCHING , TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THINGS.  PHOTOGRAPH QUALITY IS OK , VIDEO QUALITY VERY GOOD BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO  ARRANGE THEM...
      
      JUNE -  DOWNLOADED LOTS OF MUSIC AND ALL THAT STUFF. YOUTUBE VIDEOS LOOK VERY GOOD IN IT.DOWNLOADED SOME GAMES FROM X BOX. FOUND NFC USE DIFFICULT THAN SENDING VIA BLUETOOTH.
      
      OVERALL VERY GOOD ( I HAVE NEVER USED ANDROID)MY PREVIOUS PHONE WAS  A FEATURE PHONE SAMSUNG MONTE) I CAN TELL IT HAD A WINDOWS PLAYER HAVING FAR BETTER INTEGRATION OF SETTINGS ON A SINGLE SCREEN THAN THAT OF LUMIA 620. ( MAY BE I STILL HAVE A HANGOVER OF THAT PHONE  IN MY MIND.!!!........)
      
      ONE PROBLEM DON'T KNOW WHY BUT IT SOMETIMES AUTOMATICALLY SENDS MMS INSTEAD OF SMS..........COSTS TOO MUCH.
      
      BUT ,
      
      FINALLY I WANT TO SAY THIS PHONE AT THIS PRICE IS A VALUE FOR MONEY CONSIDERING OVERALL PACKAGE ........... ONLY THING BEING IT'S BATTERY SUCKS.
      
      VERY GOOD SCREEN READAIBILITY UNDER THE SUN , GOOD  TOUCH , SENDING VIA BLUETOOTH TOO DIFICULT ,.
      
      MORE UPDATES LATER"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"LOOK, FEEL AND OPERATION:
      
      THE PHONE LOOKS VERY STURDY WITH ITS SMOOTH, ROUNDED EDGES AND SOLID BACK COVER AND THUS IT IS LESS PRONE TO WEAR AND TEAR. THE BACK CASE IS FULL PLASTIC AND COVERS ALL THE SIDES (AND BACK) OF THE PHONE THUS MAKING THE PHONE LOOK VERY NEAT AND CLEAN. IT IS MADE COMPLETELY OF PLASTIC BUT DOES NOT LOOK TOO CHEAP. THE PHONE HAS A DECENT SIZED SCREEN (NOT TOO BIG NOT TOO SMALL) AND HAS ALL THE BUTTONS ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PHONE, SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE THE HAND OF A GYMNAST TO OPERATE IT - SOMETHING THAT LARGE SIZE PHONES SIMPLY DO NOT ALLOW.
      
      
      SCREEN DISPLAY AND DISPLAY INTERFACE:
      
      THE SCREEN OF THE PHONE IS VERY NICE AND CLEAN TO LOOK AT BECAUSE OF ITS SHAPE. THE HIGH RESOLUTION AND COLORS MAKE THE SCREEN LOOK NEAT, VIBRANT AND PRECISE. THE APPLICATION-TILE INTERFACE ALLOWS THE USER TO ADJUST THE SIZE, PLACEMENT AND SEQUENCE OF THE APPLICATION-TILES THUS ALLOWING GREAT SCREEN CUSTOMIZATION. YOU CAN SET THE PHONE DISPLAY ON BACKGROUND COLORS OF BLACK AND WHITE AND CHOOSE FROM THE MANY ACCENT COLORS, ALLOWING YOU TO CHANGE THE PHONE'S LOOK TO BEST SUIT YOUR MOOD.
      
      
      PHONE BUILD AND PERFORMANCE:
      
      THE PHONE HAS A VERY STURDY HARDWARE BUILD. WITH ITS 1 GHZ PROCESSOR, 512 MB RAM AND 8 GBS OF INTERNAL STORAGE, THE PHONE CAN RUN APPLICATIONS AT HIGH SPEEDS. THE 8 GIGA-BYTES OF INTERNAL STORAGE ALLOWS YOU TO STORE A LOT APPLICATIONS ON THE PHONE ITSELF, THUS ENABLING FASTER ACCESS AND FAST INTERFACE SPEEDS - SOMETHING THAT OTHER PHONES IN THIS PRICE RANGE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE. THE WINDOWS SYSTEM AND PRE-INSTALLED SOFTWARE TAKE UP ABOUT 3-4 GBS OF SPACE, SO YOU?RE REALLY LEFT WITH JUST WITH 4-5 GBS FOR YOUR OWN SOFTWARE. IT STILL BEATS ALL THE OTHERS THOUGH.
      
      
      APPS.:
      
      ALTHOUGH WINDOWS STORE BOASTS OF HAVING SEVERAL APPS, IT?S SEVERELY DISAPPOINTING WHEN IT COMES TO THE VERY POPULAR AND WANTED APPS AND GAMES. HOWEVER, NOKIA LUMIA COME WITH ITS OWN APPS LIKE HERE CITY-LENS, HERE DRIVE+, HERE MAPS (WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO NAVIGATE ON AN OFFLINE MAP - VERY CONVENIENT AND FAST) AND NOKIA MUSIC - SOMETHING THAT OTHER PLATFORMS DO NOT OFFER (CITATION NEEDED). THIS PHONE ALSO COMES WITH PRE-INSTALLED AND FREE MICROSOFT OFFICE WHICH ADDS TO THE PHONE?S VALUE.
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      FOR ITS PRICE, THE PHONE HAS AN AWESOME CAMERA. PICTURES COME OUT CLEAR, WELL-FOCUSED AND VIBRANT DUE TO ITS 5 MP CAMERA, SINGLE FLASH AND AUTO-FOCUS. THE PHONE LACKS LIGHT CONTRASTING THOUGH - SO PICTURES TAKEN AGAINST THE SUN COME OUT MEDIUM TO HORRIBLE. THE VIDEO FUNCTION GIVES YOU SHARP, SMOOTH, NON-SHAKY VIDEOS BUT AUDIO BECOMES SHRIEKY.
      
      
      ENTERTAINMENT:
      
      WATCHING PHOTOS AND VIDEOS ON THIS PHONE IS A REAL PLEASURE BECAUSE OF THE AWESOME SCREEN RESOLUTION, COLOR AND CLARITY. THE PHONE?S SPEAKER IS GOOD TOO BUT IS PLACED IN AN AWKWARD AREA AS IT CAN EASILY GET BLOCKED BY THE PALM - SOME MAY FIND THAT VERY IRRITATING. THE APP - NOKIA MUSIC - IS SOMETHING THAT MUSIC LOVERS WILL REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU CAN BE UP-TO-DATE WITH THE LATEST AND THE BEST MUSIC IN YOUR FAVORITE GENRES. THE NOKIA MUSIC STORE HAS IT IS SURPRISINGLY, THERE IS NO SEARCH FUNCTION IN MY MUSIC AND YOU HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH TO FIND YOUR SONG. IF THE NAME OF THE SONG IS EVEN A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE TRACK NAME, IT MIGHT JUST BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND YOUR SONG.
      
      
      CONNECTIVITY:
      
      THE PHONE COMES WITH ALL THE BASIC CONNECTIVITY COMPONENTS - 3G, WI-FI AND BLUETOOTH. THE HOME-SCREEN HAS A SEARCH BUTTON WHICH USES BING SEARCH ENGINE AND GIVES YOU AN INSTANT-SEARCH ABILITY. INTERNET EXPLORER IS PRE-INSTALLED IN THE PHONE AND IS QUITE SATISFACTORY. SOME PEOPLE, HOWEVER, MAY FIND IT VERY AWKWARD WITHOUT THE FORWARD AND BACK BUTTONS ON THE BROWSER AND WITH THE ADDRESS BAR AT THE BOTTOM, BUT THAT'S EASY TO GET USED TO.
      
      
      OVERALL:
      
      OVERALL, THE PHONE IS EXCELLENT. THE PHONE IS RELIABLE, STURDY BY DESIGN AND VERY GOOD LOOKING FOR ITS PRICE. WITH THE NEXT WINDOWS 8 OS UPDATE (NOT ANNOUNCED AS OF MAY 2013), WITH THIS COMBINATION OF OS AND PHONE, IT WILL DEFINITELY GIVE THE OTHER COMPETITORS A TOUGH TIME."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,MULTITASKING IS EASE JUST HOLD THE BACK KEY FOR 2 SEC AND ALL UR BACKGROUND APPS WILL SHOW AND TO ACTIVATE FACEBOOK CHAT GO IN MESSAGING AND TOUCH AND DRAG THE SCREEN TO THE R8 AND U WILL GET AND OPTION TO GO ONLINE FOR CHAT AS EASY IT CAN BE .. OR WATCH SOME TUBE VIDEOS :)
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"NEEDLESSLY TO SAY NOKIA IS BACK IN THE GAME,620 IS SUPERB DEVICE,BOASTS 1GHZ DUAL CORE SNAPDRAGON S4 WITH 512MB RAM IS GOOD ENOUGH TO RUN WP8 WITHOUT ANY LAG,THE BEAUTY OF WP OS IS ITS PEOPLE CENTRIC NATURE,USE IT FOR COUPLE OF DAYS THEN YOU WILL KNOW WHY I SAID LIKE THAT"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"NOKIA LUMIA 620 IS MY 2ND SMARTFONE, 1ST WAS SAMSUNG GALAXY Y. AT FIRST I WS CONFUSED BETWEEN HTC ONEV, S ADVANCE AND NL 620. FIRST 2 BEING DISCONTINUED MADE ME TO STICK TO 620.

      CONS:
      
      1. BATTERY LIFE, 1300MAH IS HARDLY ENOUGH FOR THIS PHONE EVEN MA PREVIOUS GALAXY Y HAD A 1200MAH
      
      2. COMPATIBILITY F SOME FILES, SOME VIDEOS/MUSIC CANT BE PLAYED
      
      (FILES DOWNLOADED FROM U2BE CAN BE PLAYED(MP4, 360P) BT VIDEOS CAPTURED IN MY GALAXY Y COULDNT !!!)I DNT KNW D REASON!!
      
      3. MS OFFICE CANT OPEN DOCUMENTS IN SD CARD, ONLY IN PHONE MEMORY
      
      
      NOKIA LUMIA 620 S SUITABLE FOR MODERATE USERS LIKE ME...
      
      
      OVERALL RATING : 8.5/10"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"PHONE BUILD QUALITY IS EXCELLENT,
      
      CAMERA IS ABOVE AVERAGE , NOT MUCH EFFECTIVE IN DARK WITH ITS FLASH FOR CONTINUES CLICKS THOUGH ITS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED IN DAYLIGHT CLICKS.
      
      
      VIDEO RECODING VERY DISAPPOINTING .. (NIGHT SHOOT IS PAIN)
      
      
      FRONT CAMERA NOT DISAPPOINTING TOO BUT ONE HAS TO MAKE SURE TO FACE OPPOSITE TO GOOD LIGHT WHILE ON VIDEO CHAT.
      
      
      I AM IN LOVE WITH ITS TOUCH INTERFACE &AMP; ITS BEST IN CLASS CLEARBALCK VIEW DISPLAY ITS NEVER DISAPPOINT IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT.
      
      
      WINDOWS MOBILE 8 IS COOL AND EASY OS &AMP; JOY TO USE ON THIS DEVICE WITH KIDS ZONE FEATURE.
      
      
      LACKS IN APPSTORES FOR THE APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE RUNNING ON ANDROIDS MOSTLY AND GOOD TO HAVE ONE..
      
      
      DISAPPOINTED WITH TRUCALLER APPLICATION INSTALLED FROM APPSTORE IT DOES NOT WORK AS IT SHOULD WORKS ON ANDROIDS FOR DETECTING CALLERS. (MANUAL EFFORTS TO SEARCH IN APP THOUGH)
      
      
      NOKIA APPS ARE GREAT LIKE MAPS, DRIVE, CITILENS, SMARTSHOOT TO NAME A FEW.
      
      
      BEST PHONE ONE CAN GET AT THIS PRICE.
      
      
      JUST GO FOR IT IF YOU ARE NOT THAT CRAZY ON THE APP RUNING IN MAKET."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"PROS:
      
      1. GREAT APPS - NOKIA CITY LENS (GOOD AUGMENTED REALITY APP), GPS (VERY ZIPPY), NOKIA DRIVE, MS OFFICE, ONE NOTE
      
      2. MUSIC - GOOD ACOUSTICS AND GELS WELL WITH MY HEADPHONES (SENNHEISER)
      
      3. W8 - SIMPLE ELEGANT INTERFACE, VERY EASY TO GET USED TO.
      
      4. SCREEN IS REALLY GOOD. VERY EASY TO READ IN SUNLIGHT. I DON'T MISS GORILLA GLASS REALLY.
      
      5. BATTERY LIFE - LASTS MUCH LONGER THAN MOST SMARTPHONES IN THE MARKET. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.
      
      6. PROCESSOR, RAM &AMP; GRAPHICS PERFORM WELL.
      
      7. EASY TO CHECK E-MAILS/FBOOK ETC.
      
      8. PERFORMS WELL ENOUGH TO BE A GOOD BUSINESS PHONE, IN ADDITION TO BEING A PEPPY LIFESTYLE-CATEGORY MOBILE PHONE.
      
      9. BOUGHT THE N-CASE ACCESSORY. DROPPED MY PHONE A COUPLE OF TIMES, NO DAMAGES. REALLY RELIEVED. :)
      
      CONS:
      
      1. CAMERA - QUALITY OF PHOTOS/VIDEOS IS OK, BUT IS SLIGHTLY INFERIOR TO THE ONES TAKEN USING NOKIA-CARL ZEISS/SAMSUNG (RS. 18K-25K RANGE). NOKIA CAMERA APPS HELP OFFSET THIS GAP SLIGHTLY.
      
      2. UI VARIETY &AMP; CUSTOMIZABILITY NOT TOO HIGH. CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING. :)
      
      3. APPS - IOS/ANDROID GAMES &AMP; NEWS APPS HAVE AN EDGE OVER THE GAMES/NEWS APPS IN THE WINDOWS 8 ECOSYSTEM. NO OTHER CRIBS."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"PROS:
      
      1.SMOOTH TOUCH; SCREEN RESOLUTION AWESOME
      
      2.PROCESSOR IS GOOD
      
      3.MUSIC GOOD; VIDEOS EXCELLENT
      
      CONS:
      
      1.SHARING VIA BLUE-TOOTH IS NOT USER FRIENDLY(ONE COULD SHARE PHOTOES &AMP; SONGS EASILY BUT PDF FILES HAVE NO BLUE THOOTH SHARING OPTIONS..AND THE VIDEOS ONLY COULD BE SHARED MOVING THEM TO THE CAMERA ROLL FOLDER)
      
      2.THERE IS NO FILE-MANAGER SHOWING IN THE HAND SET...THIS IS REALLY A SERIOUS PROBLEM(IF SOMEONE WANTS TO MANAGE HIS PICS,MUSICS ETC HE NEEDS THE HELP OF COMPUTER OR LAPTOP...I THINK THIS IS NOT DESIRABLE)
      
      3.I HAVE TO SAY THE BATTERY LIFE OF THIS PHONE IS UNLIKE NOKIA."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"PURCHASED THRU FLIPKART, RECD. ON 12TH MARCH 2013. GOOD SERVICE BY FLIPKART AND RECD. WITH 16GB MEMORY CARD FREE.
      
      
      THOSE WHO PURCHASING THE PHONE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR A WINDOWS EXPERIENCE, WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER OS. SIMPLY DOWNGRADING AFTER PURCHASING THE PHONE IS WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. HENCE NO COMPARISONS FOR WINDOWS OR ANY OTHER OS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET. EACH ONE HAVE THEIR POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES. IT'S UPTO THE BUYER'S PREFERENCE.
      
      
      I'M A CONTINUOUS ANDROID USER AND FOR A CHANGE PURCHASED THIS ONE. SATISFIED AS OF NOW.
      
      LET ME TELL YOU IN BRIEF,
      
      SCREEN CLARITY IS AT IT'S BEST,
      
      DON'T HAVE ANY MULTI TOUCH ISSUES,
      
      PHONE IS VERY FAST IN ACCESSING APPS(EXCEPT NOKIA MUSIC APP WHICH TAKES SLIGHT DELAY IN OPENING),
      
      BATTERY BACK UP OK (CAN HAVE BETTER, BUT IT'S STILL OK)
      
      GOOD CAMERA CLARITY.
      
      LATEST SOFTWARE AND OS
      
      
      CONS:
      
      PHONE IS GETTING HOT WHILE CHARGING.
      
      
      AS A NEW WINDOWS PHONE USER I'M SATISIFED WITH THE OS AND NOKIA LUMIA 620.
      
      
      I REFER THIS ONE FOR SOME ONE WHO'S LOOKING FOR A WINDOWS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,REALLY A NICE PHONE FOR THE PRICE. GOT ALL THE FEATURES A GOOD SMARTPHONE SHOULD HAVE 5MP CAMERA DUAL CORE PROCESSOR 4 INCH SCREEN. GOT A GOOD DISPLAY AND COOL DESIGN. BUT GUYS U CAN WAIT FOR ITS UPGRADE LUMIA 720 ABOUT TO COME IN INDIA IN FEW WEEKS. 720 HAS GOT BETTER SPECS BETTER SCREEN THAN THIS AND FOR A PRICE OF ONLY 17K-18K
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"SCREEN SIZE IS PERFECT AND TEXTABLE WITH JUST ONE HAND. LOOKS TRENDY AND FRONT CAMERA WORKS FLAWLESSLY WITH SKYPE VIDEO CALL. 3G RATHER THAN 2G LL GO GOOD WITH 620. UI IS INNOVATIVE COMPARED TO ICONS IN IOS AND ANDROID. THOSE WHO WANNA CHANGE, GET WINDOWS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"THE ONLY ONE ISSUE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE IS ITS BATTERY BACKUP WHILE USING INTERNET, I THINK ITS LESS THAN AVERAGE, ALL OTHERS ARE VERY VERY GOOD, INCLUDING CAMERA, VIDEO PLAY BACK (NOW I AM WATCHING FULL HD FILMS IN MY MOBILE)"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,THE PHONE IS JUST AWESOME OTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE HAVING 3.81 INCH SCREEN MAKES WRITING A TEST LITTLE BIT MESSY BUT ITS FIXED WITH THE ONBOARD WORD SUGGESTION. PHONE  ONLY LAGS FOR WHATS APP AND MUSIC AND VIDEO PLAYER THERE'S A PROBLEM[GLITCH] IN MUSIC PLAYER THAT YOU CANT RESUME YOUR LAST PLAYED MUSIC. 14K PRICE THIS IS THE BEST DEAL FOR THE PHOTOGRAPHY I MEAN PHOTOS ARE AWESOME BRILLIANT AND AFTER ADDING LENSES{CAMERA APPS} TO YOUR CAMERA YOUR PHONE WILL CLICK THAT PICS THAT YOU CANT IMAGINE. THE STORE HAVING LESS APPS AS COMPARED TO ANDROID BUT THEY ARE WORTHEIR APP THAN ANDROID.THE BIGGEST CONS IS THE BATTERY BACKUP LESS THAN 12HRS IN 3G.OTHERWISE THIS IS THE BEST DEAL.
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"THE PHONE IS REALLY AMAZING. STRONG BUILD, GOOD BATTERY, STUNNING LOOKS AND GOOD SUPPORT.
      
      
      BUT FLIP KART PRICE ARE NON-COMPETITIVE. WHEN I PURCHASED IT IN RS. 15000/- IT WAS AVAILABLE IN RS.14500/-.
      
      
      BUT BECAUSE OF MY NEGLIGENCE I BOUGHT IT COSTLY.
      
      
      GREAT SHIPPING."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"THE PHONE IS REALLY AWESOME WITH A GREAT SCREEN QUALITY, CAMERA IS OK OK, NOKIA MUSIC IS THE BEST PART FOR MUSIC LOVERS BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH TIS PHONE IS BATTERY BACKUP...I KNOW ANDROID HAS UNLIMITED APPS BT STILL AT TIS PRICE THERE IS NO OTHER PHONE WID SUCH GREAT FEATURES...ITS VERY USER FRIENDLY...THANKS 2 FLIPKART AS I GT THE PHONE @13K..."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"THE PHONE WAS DELIVERED IN A IPHONE-ESQUE SMALL-SIZE BOX, WITH ALL THE GENERAL ACCESSORIES SUCH AS THE USB CABLE-CUM-CHARGER, BATTERY AND A WELCOME ADDITION OF EAR-SHAPED BUDS. THE BUDS AREN'T A DRASTIC IMPROVEMENT, ACTUALLY IT SEEMS LIKE A RIP OFF FROM THE NEW APPLE EARPODS, BUT ITS STILL GOOD TO SEE NOKIA MAKING AN EFFORT.
      
      
      THE OS IS JUST WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM MICROSOFT, ELEGANT AND SMOOTH. THERE ARE SOME USEFUL APPS AND TYPICAL SMARTPHONE FEATURES AND SOME UNIQUE FEATURES LIKE CINEMAGRAPH, CITY LENS, NOKIA MAPS ETC. SKYDRIVE WILL BACKUP ALL YOUR PHOTOS AND DOCUMENTS, AND YOU CAN INTERACT WITH YOUR WINDOWS 7/8 LAPTOP THROUGH YOUR PHONE TOO. THE FREE MUSIC THAT NOKIA OFFERS ON THE MIX RADIO IS A WELCOME SURPRISE TOO. THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE OS ARE:
      
      ? NO DEDICATED FILE MANAGER LIKE ANDROID OR SYMBIAN, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS FILES NOT SUPPORTED BY THE DEVICE. FILES CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED THROUGH THE SUPPORTING APPS.
      
      ? CONTACTS NEED TO BE SYNCED ONLINE ONLY. IT IS A REAL PAIN TO IMPORT CONTACTS FROM YOUR OLD MOBILE.
      
      ? THERE IS NO SILENT OR DISCREET MODE!! THIS IS REALLY FRUSTRATING. YOU HAVE TO TURN THE VOLUME ALL THE WAY DOWN TO GO INTO SILENT MODE.
      
      ? THE DEVICE NEEDS A MICRO-SIM SO YOUR OLD SIM CARD WON'T WORK, YOU NEED TO CUT YOUR SIM CARD INTO A MICRO-SIM OR ASK YOUR SERVICE PROVIDER TO PROVIDE YOU ONE.
      
      
      IF YOU HAVE AN AIRTEL SIM CARD, YOU WILL ALSO GET 3GB/MONTH 3G DATA FOR FREE WITH THE BOX, ANOTHER WELCOME SURPRISE.
      
      
      THE BUILD IS AMAZING, ESPECIALLY THE CYAN ONE THAT I ORDERED. THA BACK FLAP IS DIFFICULT TO OPEN AND IT WILL TAKE A WHILE BEFORE YOU WILL START DOING IT FLUENTLY, BUT THE OVERALL LOOK IS CLASSY AND CHIC. THE DISPLAY IS CRISP AND COLOURS ARE BRIGHT. THERE AREN'T A LOT OF BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS (JUST 3: LOW, MEDIUM AND HIGH), BUT THE SCREEN IS GORGEOUS.
      
      
      THE CAMERA CLARITY IS FANTASTIC FOR THE PRICE RANGE, PHOTOS CLICK VERY FAST IN DAYLIGHT AND TAKE ABOUT 1-1.5 SECONDS IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS. THE FRONT CAM IS PLAIN BAD, BUT THERE ARE VERY FEW MODELS WHICH OFFER A FRONT CAM IN THIS PRICE RANGE, AND SO IT IS A WELCOME ADDITION.
      
      
      OVERALL, THE PHONE IS A PLEASURE TO USE. BUY IT, ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY. DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRY OUT WINDOWS 8, ITS THE FUTURE!"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"THIS IS MY FIRST SMART PHONE AND I AM PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT. OTHERS HAVE GIVEN A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECS AND THE ADVANTAGES. JUST WANTED TO MENTION 2 CONS THOUGH
      
      
      1. MANY HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE NO OF APPS AVAILABLE IN WINDOWS PLATFORM IS LOW. THOUGH IT IS TRUE, I FELT MOST OF THE REGULARLY USED APPS ARE THERE IN SOME VERSION OR THE OTHER. MY PROBLEM IS WITH THE UPDATION. UPDATION OF THE STATUS IN THE LIVE TILE IS NOT UP TO DATE AND MANY TIMES ONE HAS TO ENTER THE APP TO KNOW THE UPDATES. EG. YOU GET A MSG THRU VIBER, IT DOESNT SHOW ON THE SCREEN SOMETIMES AND YOU WILL COME TO KNOW ABOUT IT ONLY WHEN YOU OPEN THE APP.
      
      
      2. WHEN ACTIVATING BLUE TOOTH THE PHONE HANGS.
      
      
      EXCEPT FOR THESE 2 CONS, I AM SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE...."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"THIS IS REALLY A DAMN GOOD PHONE EVERY THING WAS SO NICE DISPLAY SO VIVID, CAMERA,GPS, MAPS EVERY THING FINE AND GOOD.
      
      
      ONLY THING THAT CONCERNS IS THE SHORT BATTERY LIFE. SOME TIMES ITS NECESSARY TO CHARGE TWICE A DAY FOR HEAVY USERS AND GAMERS.
      
      
      AND THEN FLIPKART GOT MY PHONE ON THE VERY NEXT DAY OF ORDERING."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"THIS PHONE CONTINUES TO AMAZE ME, THERE ALREADY ARE IMMENSE REVIEWS ALREADY;  I WOULD LIST THE USER EXPERIENCE - HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR THE PAST 15+ DAYS (PRE-ORDERED), MAPS, MUSIC IS SIMPLY AWESOME. LOUD AND CLEAR. DISPLAY IS CRISP WEBPAGES CAN LOAD QUITE FAST (DESKTOP VERSIONS ALSO). SKYPE VIDEO WORKS WELL TRIED 4-5 TIMES ON LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS THOUGH FRONT CAMERA IS VGA.
      
      
      ONLY CON IS GMAIL CAN BE SYNC BUT IS NOT PUSH LIKE IN ANDROID (THAT MEANS IT WILL CHECK MAILS AFTER REGULAR INTERVALS AS SET BUT ONE WONT GET MAIL AS THEY COME. BUT THATS NOT THE ISSUE FOR MOST.
      
      IM+ WORKS FOR GTALK AND YAHOO MESSENGER. DIDINT FIND A GOOD PDF READER THOUGH.
      
      
      OFFICE AT ITS BEST (WORD EXCEL POWERPOINT)
      
      NO FILE EXPLORER OR FILE MANAGER APP.
      
      
      NET NET A GREAT BUY IF U R BUDGET IS"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"THIS PHONE IS A WONDERFUL DELIGHT PACKED IN A SMALL PACKAGE. THE OS IS SIMPLY BUTTERY SMOOTH. TRUST ME, YOU WILL NOT GET SUCH SMOOTH FLOWING OS AT SUCH A PRICE FROM ANDROID PHONES. THE SCREEN IS GORGEOUS, HAS ZERO LAG.
      
      IF YOU WANT A SMARTPHONE WHICH DOES THE BASICS WONDERFULLY THIS IS A VERY GOOD OPTION. ALTHOUGH IT DOESNT HAVE AS MANY APPS AS IOS OR ANDROID WOULD, BUT IT HAS ENOUGH TO KEEP A BASIC SMARTPHONE USER SATISFIED. THE HDFC BANK APP ON THIS IS A PURE DELIGHT.
      
      THIS IS A ALSO A VERY ATTRACTIVE PHONE FOR THE FAIRER SEX. I GOT MY GIRLFRIEND THIS PHONE AND HER PHONE HAS BECOME THE TALK OF THE OFFICE SINCE."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"THIS PHONE IS BRILLIANT. THE CLARITY, EASE OF USE, DISPLAY QUALITY, VIEWABILITY IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT IS TERRIFIC. THE ONLY ISSUE IS THE BATTERY WHICH DRAINS OUT IN ABOUT 8 HRS OF MODERATE USAGE. BUT FOR ME THAT IS NOT MUCH OF AN ISSUE. THE REAL ADVANTAGES OF THIS PHONE IS THE FEATURES IT HAS, AND THE TECHNOLOGY IT BUNDLE. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE IT A 4.5 OUT OF 5, BUT I'M SETTLING FOR 4"
Nokia Lumia 620,4,THOUGH DELIVERED A LITTLE LATE BY THE FLIPKART GUYS IT WAS WORTH WAITING A BEAUTIFUL SMARTPHONE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS OF EITHER THE OS NOR THE PHONE JUST LOVE THE LUMIA WOULD SUGGEST TO TRY THIS PHONE TO EVERYONE
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"TO PREFACE THIS REVIEW, I AM A TECH ENTHUSIAST AND MY PERSONAL SMARTPHONE OF CHOICE IS A SAMSUNG GALAXY NEXUS (US-ONLY GOOGLE SMARTPHONE RUNNING THE CURRENT VERSION OF ANDROID). HOWEVER,  I HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS PHONE TO TWO OF MY FRIENDS WHO WERE BUYING THEIR FIRST SMARTPHONE, AND JUST PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR MY MOTHER, WHO IS MIGRATING FROM A NOKIA DUMBPHONE :)
      
      
      HERE'S WHY: THE EASE OF USE, FLUID TOUCH RESPONSE, AND ATTRACTIVE USER INTERFACE (FORMERLY KNOWN AS METRO UI) OF WINDOWS PHONE 8 OS MAKE THIS PHONE A PLEASURE TO USE AND A WELCOME ALTERNATIVE TO ANDROID AND IOS. THE DESIGN OF SOME OF THE STANDARD APPS LIKE CALENDAR AND MUSIC IS OUTSTANDING. THE MUSIC APP INHERITS ITS DNA FROM MICROSOFT'S ORIGINAL ZUNE HD PLAYER; WHEN YOU ARE CONNECTED TO WIFI, IF THE ARTIST YOU'RE LISTENING TO HAS INFORMATION AVAILABLE, IT BRINGS UP AN ATTRACTIVE BACKGROUND IMAGE FEATURING THE ARTIST ALONG WITH A BRIEF BIO. ALSO, BEING ABLE TO QUICKLY SEARCH INFO ON YOUR PHONE (CONTACTS, APPS, MUSIC) ALPHABETICALLY BEATS HAVING TO SCROLL THROUGH LONG LISTS OR SCREENS OF ICONS. THESE SMALL TOUCHES MAKE USING THE PHONE ENJOYABLE.
      
      
      THE HARDWARE AND FIT AND FINISH OF THE PHONE IS TOP NOTCH, ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRICE POINT. THE ROUNDED BACK FEELS VERY NICE IN HAND, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SMALLER HANDS. THE CYAN BLUE IS VERY ATTRACTIVE, WITH A 3D DEPTH TO THE COLOR THANKS TO THE UNIQUE DUAL-SHOT SHELL - THE APPEARANCE AND PERFORMANCE LEAVES CHEAP SAMSUNG DEVICES IN A SIMILAR PRICE RANGE FAR BEHIND IN THE DUST. WP8 IS BETTER OPTIMIZED THAN ANDROID TO RUN USING JUST 512 MB RAM, AND OUT OF THE BOX THE PERFORMANCE IS FLUID AND SNAPPY.
      
      
      PHONE CALL QUALITY IS VERY CLEAN SOUNDING, AND THE SPEAKER IS VERY LOUD (100 DB AS PER SPECS). CAMERA PERFORMANCE IS GOOD AND EVEN INDOORS IT PRODUCES CRISPER AND MORE NATURAL IMAGES COMPARED WITH MY GALAXY NEXUS (WHICH ALSO HAS A 5 MP CAMERA). NOKIA HAS OBVIOUSLY OPTIMIZED THE SOFTWARE TO WORK WELL. WIFI LOCK-IN IS EXTREMELY FAST, AND THE SENSITIVITY AND RANGE IS ON PAR WITH IPHONE IN MY HOME TEST.
      
      
      SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ABOUT THE LUMIA 520, AND HERE ARE MY THOUGHTS: IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE 620, I'D RECOMMEND IT. FOR ONE, THE POLARIZING FILTER OF THE CLEARBLACK DISPLAY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN VIEWING IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT. IT ALSO RESULTS IN DEEPER BLACKS WHICH ARE QUITE CLOSE TO SAMOLED DISPLAYS SAMSUNG USES ON ITS HIGHER END PHONES. THE PIXEL DENSITY IS ALSO HIGHER ON THE LUMIA 620 (246 PPI, VS 230 FOR THE LUMIA 520) - WHAT THIS MEANS IS THE TEXT IS CRISPER AND LESS FUZZY. THE DISPLAY COLORS ARE ALSO MORE SATURATED ON THE 620. AT 3.81"", THE SCREEN ISN'T NOTICEABLY SMALLER ON THE 620, BUT YOU GET THESE ADDED BENEFITS.
      
      NEEDLESS TO ADD, HAVING AN LED FLASH (MISSING ON THE LUMIA 520) MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT IF YOU NEED TO TAKE PICTURES INDOORS, EVEN IN THE DAYTIME, THEY WILL TURN OUT BETTER. THE 520 DOES HAVE A PROXIMITY SENSOR DESPITE SOME MISINFORMATION POSTED HERE IN ANOTHER REVIEW; IT LACKS THE AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR FOUND ON THE 620 AND HIGHER LUMIA DEVICES WHICH CONTROLS AUTO BRIGHTNESS - ADJUSTING DISPLAY BRIGHTNESS DEPENDING ON YOUR ENVIRONMENT.
      
      
      DRAWBACKS: AT 3.81"" THE SCREEN IS CERTAINLY SMALL IN A WORLD WHERE THE TREND SEEMS TO BE TOWARDS INCREASINGLY LARGE DEVICES (SAMSUNG, ANYONE?) HOWEVER, NOT EVERYONE APPRECIATES HAVING SUCH LARGE DEVICES, AND THIS COULD BE SEEN AS A POSITIVE. BATTERY LIFE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER (I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TEST EXTENSIVELY), YET MOST RESPECTED TECH PUBLICATIONS HAVE NOTED OVER A DAY OF TYPICAL USE. BE SURE TO ENABLE BATTERY SAVER MODE, AND TURN OFF WIFI AND LOCATION SERVICES WHEN YOU DON'T USE THEM TO EXTEND BATTERY LIFE. AS HAS BEEN SAID BY OTHERS, APP SELECTION IS LIMITED COMPARED WITH ANDROID OR IOS. I HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS PHONE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT HEAVY APP USERS. STILL, FOR DAILY TASKS AND ENTERTAINMENT, WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE WINDOWS STORE IS PLENTY. IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE MORE APP DEVELOPERS WILL BE GETTING ON BOARD AS WINDOWS PHONE GROWS IN MARKET SHARE IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. GOOGLE DOESN'T SEEM INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING WINDOWS PHONE, SO YOU WILL NEVER GET AN OFFICIAL GMAIL APP, OR A GOOGLE MAPS APP - IF YOU'RE REALLY HEAVY GOOGLE SERVICES USER, ANDROID MIGHT BE A BETTER OPTION. HOWEVER, THE NOKIA/WP8 ALTERNATIVES ARE QUITE ADEQUATE; IN FACT, I QUITE LIKE THE WAY EMAIL IS PRESENTED IN THE UNIFIED INBOX.
      
      
      CONCLUSION: THIS IS A GREAT SMARTPHONE WITH NO OBVIOUS COMPROMISES THAT FRUSTRATE YOU. IT LOOKS AND FEELS ATTRACTIVE, AND PERFORMS AS SMOOTHLY AS PREMIUM DEVICES. RECOMMENDED."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"USING THIS PHONE FOR FEW WEEKS NOW. QUITE A GOOD PHONE CONSIDERING THE PRICE TAG. WINDOWS 8 IS SOMETHING NEW AND DIFFERENT IN PHONE ARENA, AND ONCE U GET USED TO, U'LL DEFINITELY LIKE IT.  WINDOWS 8 DOES ALL THE BASIC AND NECESSARY WORKS WITH EASE AND IT HAS FIXED ALMOST ALL COMPLAINTS AGAINST ITS PREVIOUS VERSION LIKE BLUETOOTH SHARING, MICRO SD SUPPORT, DRAG N DROP IN PC ETC. OVERALL SATISFIED WITH THE OS.
      
      
      NOKIA HAS ALSO DONE GOOD JOB IN ALMOST EVERYTHING - GOOD BUILT, SMART LOOKS, BUNCH OF VERY USEFUL APPS (LIKE CITY LENS, HERE DRIVE ETC). CAMERA IS DESCENT, SO IS MUSIC. NOT A SLIM ONE, BUT REALLY DOESN'T BOTHER ME, FITS MY PALM VERY WELL.
      
      
      ONLY THING THAT HAS DISAPPOINTED ME IS THE BATTERY, 1300 MAH BATTERY DOESN'T GO LONG FOR THE SMARTPHONE. IF YOU DON'T USE INTERNET AND GAMING, GIVES JUST OK-TYPE BACKUP. BUT ONCE U R INTO 3G, BATTERY DRAINS LIKE BLACK MAGIC!
      
      
      AND THE OS, WINDOWS 8 - LAGS MILES BEHIND ANDROID AND IOS IN APPS. YES NOT ALL THEIR APPS ARE USEFUL, BUT STILL LOT OF IMPORTANT ONES ARE MISSING. AND AGE OLD GAME LIKE FRUIT NINJA IS NOT FREE, TEMPLE RUN DOESN'T RUN ON THIS HANDSET AS IT HAS 512 MB RAM!
      
      
      AND SOME VERY PRIMITIVE FEATURES ARE MISSING - LIKE FM! AND YOU CANNOT SEE CALL DURATION IN LOGS! HOPE MS &AMP; NOKIA WILL GIVE AN UPDATE TO FIX THESE THINGS."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"WELL, I GOT THIS SET JUST YESTERDAY. 7 STARS FOR FLIPCART FOR DELIVERY WITHIN 36 HOURS OF ORDER!!!
      
      
      NOW COMING TO THE SET, SEEMS TO BE A GOOD ONE AT THE PRICE POINT.
      
      PROS:
      
      1) GOOD DESIGN, STURDY BUILD, NICE TO HOLD IN HAND.
      
      2) DISPLAY - NOT A MATCH FOR FLAGSHIP DEVICES LIKE GALAXY S SERIES OR HTC ONE, BUT SEEMS MUCH BETTER THAN THE COMPETETORS IN THIS PRICE RANGE.VIEWING ANGLES ARE GOOD, SUNLIGHT LEGIBILITY IS ALSO BETTER THAN AVERAGE.
      
      2) PERFORMANCE - WP8 RUNS BUTTER SMOOTH WITH THE CONFIGURATION. MUCH BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN ANDROID.NO HANGING OR LAGS TILL NOW.
      
      3)CAMERA - DECENT ONE,ALTHOUGH LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY IS NOT SO GOOD EVEN WITH FLASH.HOWEVER, AT THIS PRICE POINT THIS IS ""ABOVE EXPECTATION"". NOKIA LENSES ARE PRETTY INTERESTING.
      
      4) MUSIC AND MULTIMEDIA - VERY GOOD. NICE AUDIO, VIDEOS RUN VERY WELL.
      
      
      CONS
      
      1) REMOVING THE BATTERY COVER IS A PAIN IN THE NECK. YOU HAVE TO PRESS ON THE CAMERA LENS AT THE BACK WHILE PULLING THE BACK PANEL AND PRAYING TO GOD THAT NOTHING HAPPENS TO YOUR CAMERA LENS.THE BACK PANEL IS A BIT SLIPPERY, ACCIDENTAL DROPS MAY HAPPEN.
      
      2) THE BEZEL BELOW THE  LCD SCREEN COULD HAVE BEEN NARROWER, MAKING THE PHONE MORE COMPACT. ALSO THE PHONE IS A BIT STUBBY.
      
      3) WP8 IS A LITTLE ""ALIEN"" TO START WITH, BUT YOU WILL GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT.ALSO THERE IS NO FILE MANAGER.
      
      4) BATTERY DRAINS OUT PRETTY FAST. WITH MY MODERATE USAGE (1 HR CALL, 30 MINUTES GAMES, 30 MINS OF PAYING VIDEO AND 1 HOUR OF NET SURFING, IT COULD LAST ONLY A DAY. HOPE THIS WILL IMPROVE WITH USAGE.
      
      
      ONE RATING POINT DEDUCTED BECAUSE OF CONS 1 &AMP; 4.
      
      
      PLEASE NOTE THAT DESIGN WISE LUMIA 520 LOOKS BETTER WITH SAME HARDWARE CONFIGURATION. ITS SCREEN, HOWEVER, IS INFERIOR TO LUMIA 620, ALSO NO FLASH. ON THE OTHER HAND IT WILL SAVE YOU RS. 3500.
      
      
      HOPE THIS HELPS."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"WINDOWS  PHONES ARE ALWAYS GOOD  USER  FRIENDLY  AND GOOD LOOKS
      
      THIS ONE IS EVEN MORE DUTIFUL  VERY HAPPY  WITH THIS PHONE
      
      THERE?S ALWAYS ONE PERSON WITH THEIR EYES CLOSED. BUT WITH SMART SHOOT, ONE CLICK OF THE CAMERA TAKES A SERIES OF SNAPS. TAKE THE BEST BITS FROM EACH PHOTO TO CREATE THE PERFECT GROUP SHOT."
Nokia Lumia 620,4,"WINDOWS PHONE 8 STANDS OUT AND LUMIA 620 IS BEST BUY!
      
      NOTE: THIS REVIEW WAS POSTED FEW DAYS AGO AND IT WAS MOST USEFUL REVIEW ACCORDING TO USERS VOTE. FLIPKART DELETED IT FOR NO REASON OR WHO KNOWS IF SOMEBODY AT FLIPKART ALSO FEARS OF RISE OF WINDOWS PHONE! ON A SERIOUS NOTE, BEING USER OF GALAXY SII AND LUMIA 820 (WP8), I HAVE USED BOTH PLATFORMS EXTENSIVELY AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE TO THIS REVIEW SO RE POSTING IT!
      
      ------
      
      WHY SHOULD YOU BUY WP? WHY NOT ANDROID OR IOS? BEST ANSWER IS WP DOES BASIC TASKS VERY EFFICIENTLY. WP IS NOT APP-CENTRIC LIKE ANDROID OR IOS.
      
      FEW EXAMPLES:
      
      1. YOU CAN INTEGRATE ALL CONTACTS FROM ALL UR ACCOUNTS (FACEBOOK, HOTMAIL/OUTLOOK, GOOGLE, LINKEDIN, TWITTER ETC.) INTO SINGLE PLACE CALLED PEOPLE'S HUB.
      
      YOU CAN CREATE A GROUP, BY CHOOSING SOME PEOPLE &AMP; NAME THAT GROUP, THEN PIN IT TO START. THAT GROUP TILE ONLY CONTAINS INFO ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE U SELECTED. IF U SWIPE RIGHT SIDE, YOU GET ALL UPDATES FROM ALL SET ACCOUNTS IN SINGLE PLACE LIKE FACEBOOK WALL/TWEETS ETC.
      
      IF YOU USE ANDROID OR IOS, YOU MUST INSTALL MULTIPLE APPS AND JUMP BETWEEN THEM AND THERE ARE SOME 3RD PARTY APPS TOO BUT THEIR EXPERIENCE IS VERY DULL AND NOT POLISHED COMPARED TO INTEGRATED APPROACH OF WP.
      
      
      2. PRESSING CAMERA KEY LAUNCHES CAMERA NO MATTER WHERE U ARE, EVEN IF PHONE IS LOCKED (LONG PRESS CAMERA BUTTON). SNAP A PIC AND INSTANTLY SHARE IT IN ANY WAY U WANT (NFC, MAIL, BLUETOOTH ETC). SAME WORKS FOR SEARCH BUTTON.
      
      MANY TIMES YOU INSTALL APPLICATIONS RELATED TO CAMERA. IN ANDROID U MUST LAUNCH THAT APP FOR USING IT. IN WP, LAUNCH CAMERA NORMALLY AND PRESS LENSES OPTION &AMP; U GET LIST OF ALL APPS RELATED TO CAMERA AND U CAN SIMPLY CHOOSE ONE FROM LIST AND BAM! YOU GET THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE APP , DON'T LIKE THAT LENS? CHOOSE ANOTHER OR DOWNLOAD MORE FROM STORE.
      
      
      3. TILES: YOU CAN PIN YOUR FAVOURITE WEB PAGES, VIDEOS, ALBUMS, DOCUMENTS, CONTACTS ETC. TO UR HOMESCREEN FOR QUICK ACCESS. YOU CAN ALSO PIN SHORTCUTS FOR SWITCHING ON/OFF BLUETOOTH, WIFI ETC. YOU CAN ALSO PIN TILES FOR STOCKS, WEATHER, NEWS ETC.
      
      LIVE TILES HELP U TO SEE WHAT?S HAPPENING; THEY GET UPDATED IN REAL TIME. OVERALL INTERFACE OF WP IS VERY CLEAN, INTUITIVE &AMP; CONSISTENT ACROSS THE OS AND EVEN THE THIRD PARTY APPS.
      
      
      4. KID'S CORNER: YOU HAVE KIDS? THEN KID'S CORNER IS FOR YOU. IT?S IS LIKE A PHONE INSIDE ANOTHER PHONE. TURN ON KID'S CORNER AND ADD APPS, GAMES, MUSIC WHICH YOU WANT TO ALLOW ACCESS.
      
      WHEN U PRESS LOCK BUTTON, PHONE GETS TURNED ON AND NOW SWIPE TOWARDS RIGHT, U GET SECOND LOCK SCREEN FOR YOUR KID. KID'S CORNER CUTS OFF CONNECTIVITY AND PREVENTS CHILDREN FROM ACCESS OR MESSING WITH DATA.
      
      DON'T HAVE KIDS? USE IT LIKE ""MEDIA CENTRE"" OR ""NOKIA CENTRE"" WITH SPECIFIC APPS U SELECTED. I TURNED KID'S CORNER INTO MEDIA CENTRE WITH ALL MEDIA STUFF. YOU CAN ALSO USE IT AS GUEST ACCOUNT BY ADDING ALL NON-PERSONAL APPS SO THAT YOU CAN HANDOVER UR PHONE TO ANYONE WITHOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS.
      
      
      5. SKY DRIVE: SKY DRIVE UPLOADS AUTOMATICALLY WHATEVER PHOTOS AND CONTACTS U ADDED IN YOUR PHONE TO THE CLOUD- AS OUTLOOK OR GOOGLE. YOU CAN TURN OFF IF U WANT, BUT IT?S QUITE USEFUL BECAUSE DATA IS SAFE ON CLOUD.
      
      
      6. DON?T FORGET NOKIA &AMP; MS APPS. THEY ARE AWESOME! OFFICE AND OFFICE 365 SUITE IS INTEGRATED IN OS ALONG WITH EXCHANGE SERVER FOR BUSINESS USERS. THERE ARE OFFICIAL APPS FOR OTHER MS PRODUCTIVITY TOOLS LIKE LYNC.
      
      NOKIA HERE DRIVE IS ONLY TRUE OFFLINE VOICE GUIDED TURN BY TURN NAVIGATION SUITE IN WHOLE WORLD! YOU CAN DOWNLOAD COUNTRY OR STATE MAPS AND NAVIGATE OFFLINE WHEN THERE IS NO DATA CONNECTIVITY OR NO DATA ROAMING IN ODD PLACES YOU MAY HAVE TO TRAVEL. WHAT ELSE YOU WANT?! IF YOU DO, HERE MAPS, CITY LENS AND TRANSIT APPS COMPLETE LOCATION BASED EXPERIENCE. I HAVE FOUND ALL THOSE APPS BY MS AND NOKIA VERY USEFUL ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS. AND IT?S FREE!
      
      
      -------
      
      SURE, I CAN MAKE EVEN BIGGER LIST GUYS, BUT MY POINT IS SIMPLE, AFTER U USE WP FOR A MONTH OR TWO, IT?S HARD TO GO BACK TO APP-CENTRIC ANDROID.
      
      AT THIS PRICE, NO ANDROID DEVICE CAN PLAY ANY HIGH END GAME ANYWAY APART FROM NORMAL GAMES, FORGET THE RICH UX AND FUNCTIONALITY OF WP.
      
      MANY RESTRICTIONS OF WP7.X ARE REMOVED IN WP8. IT SUPPORTS DRAG AND DROP, NO NEED OF ZUNE OR WINDOWS PHONE APP (IT?S OPTIONAL). BT FILE SHARING IS BUILT IN AND WORKS FLAWLESSLY WITH ANY OTHER DEVICE. KERNEL IS CHANGED TO WINDOWS NT SO THAT APPS ARE EASY TO PORT FROM WINDOWS 8 AND RT. UNITY ENGINE IS SUPPORTED FOR GAMING SO GAMES ARE EASY TO PORT FROM ANDROID AND IOS. EXPECT MANY NEW APPS AND GAMES IN COMING DAYS TO WP8 DUE TO THESE CORE CHANGES.
      
      EXPANDABLE MEMORY IS ADDED. DUAL BAND WIFI IS AVAILABLE ON ALL WP8 LUMIA PHONES. ONLY OTHER DEVICES HAVING IT ARE IPHONE 5, IPAD 4 , GALAXY S3 , NOTE 2 AND IPOD TOUCH 5TH GEN. EVERY OTHER PHONE HAS 2.4 GHZ WIFI WHICH IS SLOWER THAN 5 GHZ BAND.

      1)3G WITH VODAFONE DOES NOT WORK MOST OF THE TIME. ALMOST ALL OF THE TIME, IT STAYS ON 2G. AS SOON AS I SWITCH MY SIM TO ANDROID HANDSET, 3G WORKS FINE.
      
      2) UNABLE TO ATTACH DOCUMENTS WHILE SENDING MAIL FROM THIS HANDSET.
      
      3) OFFICE EMAILS CAN'T BE SETUP UNTIL AND UNLESS ACTIVESYNC IS ENABLED. ON ANDROID, TOUCHDOWN IS AVAILABLE. BLACKBERRY ALLOWS ANYWAYS.

Nokia Lumia 620,3,HI FRIENDS. I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER USING IT FOR A WEEK. LIVE TILES AND CAMERA APPS ARE AWESOME AND I LOVE IT. IT ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY HD VIDEOS AND THE COLORS ARE BRILLIANT IN IT. YOU WONT FIND MUCH APPS FOR YOUR PHONE. THE MOST WORRYING FACTOR IS THE BATTERY. IT CANT EVEN LAST FOR EVEN 10HRS. WITHIN 3HRS OF BROWSING AND DOWNLOADING HALF OF THE BATTERY POWER IS GONE. IF YOU ARE A GAME LOVER THIS IS NOT A RIGHT OPTION.
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"HI GUYS,
      
      I BOUGHT NOKIA LUMIA 620 ON THE 2ND DAY OF ITS LAUNCH FROM A NOKIA STORE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO USE THIS PHONE INSTEAD OF MY HTC DESIRE X AS I WOULD BE ABLE TO CONFIGURE ALL MY MAIL ACCOUNTS AND OUTLOOK WITH THE PHONE AND ALSO WILL BE ABLE TO USE GOOGLE DRIVE TO ACCESS ALL MY DOCUMENTS ANYTIME. BUT THIS PHONE SUCKS, FIRST OF ALL YOU CANNOT USE ANY OTHER BROWSER EXCEPT FOR THE PRE INSTALLED  INTERNET EXPLORER, YOU CANNOT USE GOOGLE MAPS, GOOGLE ACCOUNTS CANNOT BE CONFIGURED WITH THIS PHONE. EVEN WHILE CONFIGURING GOOGLE ACCOUNT IT SHOWS ONLY ONE ERROR EVERY TIME "" YOU HAVE ENTERED WRONG INFORMATION"", AND THE MOST PATHETIC INTERNET EXPLORER IS SHOWING AN ERROR EVERY-TIME IF I AM TRYING TO USE IT ON DESKTOP VERSION SETTINGS.
      
      SOME TIMES IT ACTS WEIRDLY LIKE I WAS PLAYING AE 3D MOTOR, IT IS A VERY SMALL GAME. BUT MY PHONE STUCK IN BETWEEN AND ONLY WORKED WELL AFTER RESTARTING. IT WAS NOT THE 1ST CASE, ABOUT 2-3 TIMES IT STUCK IN BETWEEN WHILE I WAS NAVIGATING IN SETTINGS PAGES.
      
      USER GUIDE OF NOKIA IS ALSO NOT UPTO THE MARK, AS THEY HAVE SKIPPED LOT OF INFORMATION WHICH IS QUITE NECESSARY FOR A CUSTOMER,"
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"HI GUYS,
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT NOKIA LUMIA 800 ON NOVEMBER WHEN THE PRICE GOT DOWN...
      
      WHEN MY PACK UNBOXED I WAS VERY EXCITED TO LOOK AT THE PHONE.
      
      I GOT AT RS. 19,000.
      
      I WAS VERY AMAZED AFTER THE STEP UP FROM MY ""SAMSUNG G Y DUOS"".
      
      THE DISPLAY,
      
      THE CAMERA,
      
      THE LOOKS,
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY,
      
      THE EVERYTHING I LIKED MOST.
      
      THE PROBLEMS WAS NOT WITH ANY OF THE HARDWARE,BUT THE PLATFORM......
      
      WP IS THE ONLY PLATFORM WHICH I HATED MOST AFTER USING.
      
      1ST I AM COMING TO SOME OF ITS GOOD'S
      
      PROS:
      
      1.DEEP FACEBOOK INTEGRATION.
      
      2.LIVE TILES
      
      3.SPECIAL NOKIA APPS
      
      4.PEOPLE APP
      
      5.OS IS BUTTERY SMOOTH
      
      ETC.
      
      NOW THE CONS:
      
      1.THE OFFICE SUCKS REALLY WORSE THAN A 60 RS. OFFICE APP(REMEMBER U CANT EDIT ANY .XLS OR .PPT FILES CREATED BY SUMONE ELSE OTHER THAN UR MOBILE.)
      
      2.NO WEBSITE WHICH IS FLASH RUNNING CANT BE OPENED.
      
      3.NO FILE MANAGER TO BROWSE FILES
      
      4.NO BLUETOOTH SHARING OF VIDEOS.
      
      5.U CAN ONLY DOWNLOAD SONGS BY NOKIA MUSIC.
      
      6.IF U MANAGED TO DOWNLOAD ANY SONG BY 3RD PARTY APP U WILL NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY IT MORE THAN 40 SECS.
      
      7.ONLY PICS CAN BE SAVED TO THE PHONE FROM ANY WEBSITE.
      
      8.NO VIDEOS ARE ALLOWED TO DOWNLOAD.
      
      9.FILE SIZE MORE THAN 50 MB CANT BE DOWNLOADED FROM MARKETPLACE(BEFORE BUY IT TAKE A BROADBAND WITH ROUTER AT UR HOME &AMP; ALSO BUY A WI-FI MODEM OF RS. 5000 &AMP; CARRY IT IN UR POCKET.)
      
      10.NO GOOD GAME IS FOR FREE IN MARKET,IF U R GAME FREAK EVERY MONTH U HAVE TO SPEND 500 RS. FOR PURCHASING GAME LIKE ME.
      
      11.ZUNE-----A PAIN.IT ONLY ALLOW SYNC MP4 &AMP; SOME AVI FILES TO PHONE.
      
      RATHER U WANT TO WATCH MOVIE ON THE PHONE,U HAVE CONVERT IT 1ST A GOOD VIDEO CONVERTER,OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT SYNCED TO UR PHONE.
      
      12.OTHERS I AM NOT MENTIONING..........
      
      IN MY THOUGHT ITS 80% IMMATURE OS COMPARED TO ""ANDROID OR SYMBIAN"" .
      
      SO MY SUGGESTION GUYS IF U R MIGRATING FROM JAVA BASED OS TO WP,U WILL LOVE IT &AMP; 1 CAUTION ,NEVER GO TO COMPARE UR FRIEND HIGH END ANDROID PHONE WITH IT,U WILL LOSE CONFIDENCE IN UR OWN DEVICE.
      
      ITS A HARDCORE BUSINESS ORIENTED OS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ALSO CARRY THEIR NOTEBOOK ALWAYS ALONGWITH THEIR PHONE &AMP; WHO HAS NO TIME FOR ENTERTAINMENT ESPECIALLY ON PHONE RATHER THAN SOCIAL NETWORKING......
      
      IF U WANT FEATURE PACKED ENTERTAINMENT WITH EVERYTHING MEANS ANYTHING U CAN THINK A MOBILE CAN DO,GO FOR ANDROID.....
      
      FOR RS 500 MORE U WILL GET GALAXY S ADVANCE OR WITH SUMWHAT SAME SPECS(PROCESSOR IS SCORPION S3) FOR 2K LESS GO FOR XPERIA SOLA
      
      SURELY U WILL LOVE IT.
      
      FINALLY I HAVE SOLD MY LUMIA 800 FOR 12000 YESTERDAY &AMP; PLANNING TO BUY XPERIA ZL OR HTC ONE(CONFUSED BUT HAPPY.)
      
      
      FINAL WORDS:THEY WILL TELL U WP 8 IS FAR BETTER THAN WP 7.8 ,BUT BELIEVE ME ITS OLD WINE IN OLD BOTTLE NOT IN A NEW BOTTLE ALSO.....
      
      THANKS GUYS....
      
      DONT MAKE MISTAKE LIKE ME ......
      
      OHHHHHHHH........
      
      IF U CALL SUMONE 30 TIMES SIMULTANEOUSLY.......THE PHONE WILL SHOW 30 TIMES HIS NUMBER IN UR DIALLED LIST.....
      
      IT CANT GROUP THE CALL LOG.....
      
      FOR SIMPLE UNDERSTANDING,IF U CALL A PERSON ""AMIT"" 5 TIMES....IT WILL SHOW U
      
      AMIT
      
      AMIT
      
      AMIT
      
      AMIT
      
      AMIT....IN UR CALL LOG WITH NO CALL DURATION.
      
      &AMP; ONLY ZUNE(WP 7.8) OR X-BOX MUSIC(WP 8) IS THE ONLY MUSIC &AMP; VIDEO PLAYER...
      
      NOTHING ELSE....(JUST LIKE S 40 NOKIA DEVICE)
      
      IF U GUYS SAY THAT THIS IS A SMART ""OS""......?????
      
      INVEST UR MONEY &AMP; AFTER FEW DAYS DONT THINK ""ANDROID IS BETTER"".......
      
      BCOZ ""ANDROID IS BETTER"".....
      
      THIS IS THE COMMENT FROM A 4 MONTHS LUMIA 800 USER....
      
      
      THANKS FRIENDS......."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"HI GUYS.....
      
      ITS ""TIRTHANKAR"" AGAIN.....
      
      
      FOR THOSE WHO DEBATED MY PREVIOUS REVIEW:
      
      
      PLEASE DONT MIND THIS TIME I AM GOING TO TELL SOME MORE FACTS SIDE BY SIDE ON ""ANDROID"" WITH ""WP"".....WITH THE USABILITY &AMP; REAL LIFE NEEDS.....
      
      WP:
      
      1.U HAVE EXTERNAL STORAGE,BUT NO FILE MANAGER TO BROWSE THEM.
      
      2.U HAVE BLUETOOTH SHARE THROUGH A APP WHICH IF U WANT TO RUN U HAVE TO TURN APP &AMP; BLUETOOTH ALWAYS SIDE BY SIDE.
      
      3.THE OFFICE SUITE IS A KIND OF JOKE(IF U DONT BELIEVE,GO CHECK ANY WP OFFICE WITH ANY .XLS OR .PPTX &AMP; WITH SAME FILE TRY TO EDIT IN AN ANDROID DEVICE WHICH HAS A DOC EDITOR U WILL CAME TO KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.)
      
      4.A SINGLE PLAYER FOR MUSIC &AMP; VIDEOS(I DONT KNOW X-BOX MUSIC ON WP8 COMES WITH EQUILIZER OR NOT,BUT ZUNE PLAYER DONT HAVE IT.).
      
      5.NO GAME FOR FREE(ANY GOOD ONE)THE PRICE SUMTIMES GRADUALLY INCREASES(EXAMPLE:CONTRE JOUR).
      
      6.IF U BUY NOKIA WP,THEIR GAMES (GAMES BY NOKIA)ARE ALSO NOT FOR FREE,IF U DONT BELIEVE GO TO MARKETPLACE &AMP; SEE IT URSELF.
      
      7.U GUYS R SAYING &AMP; GOING THROUGH THE TECH REVIEWS OF BIG WEBSITES......
      
      I SUGGEST U WHO SAYS ANDROID IS MORE BATTERY HUNGRY,GO TO GSMARENA &AMP; SEE THE BATTERY TEST PERFORMED ON VARIOUS DEVICE....U WILL NOT SEE ANY MAJOR DIFFERENCE.
      
      NOW FOR THE ANDROID:
      
      1.A HUGE NO. OF GAMES &AMP; APPS FOR DAILY LIFE COMES FOR FREE.(DONT GO FOR USELESS APPS &AMP; GAMES,ONLY SEARCH THOSE WHICH U NEED,U WILL SURELY FIND IT IS FREE)
      
      2.TWO SIMPLE THING ""BLUETOOTH SHARING"" &AMP; ""BROWSING FILES"" CAN BE DONE WITHOUT GIVING ANY EXTRA EFFORT(JUST KIDDING).
      
      3.U HAVE DIFFERENT MEDIA PLAYERS FOR DIFFERENT TYPE OF FILES.
      
      
      LASTLY A BIG QUESTIONS TO WP FAN BOYS?????
      
      U GUYS HAVE MIGRATED FROM WINDOWS XP TO WINDOWS 7 OR 8,AFTER KNOWING THAT IT NEEDS ATLEAST 2 GB RAM &AMP; 1.4 GHZ PROCESSOR ATLEAST BCOZ WINDOWS 7 CAN PERFORM BETTER BY ANY MEANS THAN XP IN NORMAL LIFE,SO U CONSIDERED BETTER PROCESSOR &AMP; MORE RAM,SINCE WINDOWS XP NEEDS ONLY 512MB RAM TO RUN IT SMOOTHLY.
      
      IF U DONT UNDERSTAND TRY TO INSTALL WINDOWS 7 ULTIMATE IN A PC WHICH HAS A 1GHZ SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR WITH 512 MB RAM......U WILL SEE WHAT IS HAPPENED.....((HA HA HA HA)......
      
      THAT IS THE UNDERLYING REASON I THINK CAUSE I AM NOT A TECH GUY,JUST A NORMAL PERSON.
      
      SINCE ANDROID HAS MORE CAPABILITIES OF DOING THINGS ,IT NEEDS MORE PROCESSING POWER &AMP; MORE RAM.
      
      AND 1 REQUEST DONT COMPARE ""WP8"" WITH THE ""ANDROID GINGERBREAD"".
      
      SINCE ITS LATEST OS,COMPARE SIDE BY SIDE WITH ""WP8 WITH ANDROID JELLY BEAN"".......
      
      U WILL SURELY SEE THE DIFFERENCE......
      
      JUST GO &AMP; COMPARE REAL THINGS IN SMARTPHONE STORES......
      
      THEN CAME HERE &AMP; TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY SHOULD BUY??????????
      
      
      HOPE MY 2 REVIEWS HELPED U PEOPLE UNDERSTAND .....
      
      
      THANKS FRIENDS....."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"HI, I BROUGHT THIS PHONE A MONTH BACK, I JUST NOTICED SOME POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES  IN THE  PHONE.
      
      POSITIVES:
      
      1. VERY NICE DISPLAY FOR THE PRICE.
      
      2. CLARITY  CAMERA
      
      3. FINE HD VIDEO.
      
      4. VERY FAST CHARGING THE BATTERY.
      
      5.  LIMITED SAR.
      
      6. FINE OFFLINE MAPS.
      
      7. BATTERY HOLDS A DAYS FOR LIMITED USE.
      
      8. HEADPHONE JACKS COMES   IN BACKCOVER, IN CASE LIQUID GOES INSIDE TO  AUDIO JACK WE CAN REPLACE ONLY THE BACKCOVER INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE BOARD.
      
      9. INTERNAL SPEAKER SOUND IS FINE.
      
      10. TOUCH SENSE IS ABSOLUTELY FINE.
      
      11. SOME OF THE TRIAL GAMES ARE FINE.
      
      
      NEGATIVES:
      
      1. THE POWER BUTTON  IS  CENTRE, SO THAT WE CANNOT HOLD THE PHONE PROPERLY IN HAND, WHILE PRESSING THE KEY.
      
      2. WHILE TAKING PHOTOS AND VIDEOS WITH FLASH, IMAGE IS NOT CLEAR, IT IS WHITISH.
      
      3. DAILER PAD IS NOT SO GOOD, ITS VERY HARD TO USE. I WON'T SHOW THE PEOPLE WHILE DIALING AND THE CLEAR KEY IS ALSO ON THE TOP.
      
      4. UNABLE TO DOWNLOAD SONG FROM  INTERNET. IF YOU DOWNLOAD A SONG, IT WILL PLAY IN MUSIC PLAYER.
      
      5.  SEARCH KEY IS WASTE IN THE PHONE. MOST OF THEM ARE USING GOOGLE INSTEAD OF BING.
      
      6. SHARING THE INTERNET THROUGH THE USB CABLE IS NOT POSSIBLE.
      
      7. NO SHORTCUT FOR WIFI, LOCATION, BLUETOOTH AND SO.
      
      8.  WE CANNOT DIRECTLY ACCESS THE MEMORY CARD.
      
      9. SETTINGS ARE VERY  LIMITED. NO PROFILES, NO TASKBAR, NO TASK MANGER.
      
      10. MOST OF THE APPLICATION IN STORE ARE COST. MOST  OF THE FREE APPLICATION ARE WORST.
      
      11. HEADSET DOESN'T HAVE ANSWER BUTTON AND THE SOUND  QUALITY ALSO NOT SO FINE.
      
      12. WE CANNOT STOP THE ROTATION. THERE IS NO ON/OFF BUTTONS.
      
      
      CONCLUSION.
      
      IT VERY HARD TO USE THE SMARTPHONE. NOT QUALITY SOFTWARE'S. BETTER BUY AFTER, ANY UPDATES COME FROM WINDOWS.  IF YOU WANT  TO BUY NOW ITSELF. DON'T DO THAT, I THINK JUST BUY A COW INSTEAD OF BUYING THIS  PHONE. IT IS HELPFUL. IF YOU ALREADY BUY THE PHONE THEN  JUST PROUD  TO SAY, I AM USING WINDOWS PHONE. NOTHING THAN THAT AND THAT ALSO NO LONGER."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"HI,
      
      
      THIS WEBSITE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING QUICKLY TO FULFILL THE PROMISES MADE. I HAVE PRE-ORDERED THIS PHONE ON 3RD MARCH. THE STATUS STILL SHOWS WILL BE DISPATCHED WHEN RELEASED AS ON 18TH MARCH. WRITTEN 3 EMAILS AND CALLED UP THE CUSTOMER CARE SIMILAR TIMES. EACH TIME I HAVE BEEN GIVEN FALSE PROMISES (IT WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS IN 2-3 DAYS SIR) WONDER WHEN THESE 3 DAYS WILL BE OVER I WILL BE GETTING THE PHONE.
      
      
      I AM NOT EVEN IN A REMOTE LOCATION (JAIPUR, A STATE CAPITAL). THE WHOLE CHARM OF PRE-ORDERING IS LOST. MAY BE YOU GUYS(FLIPKART) WILL DO GOOD AS E-COMMERCE IN INDIA BOOM BUT YOU HAVE FOR SURE LOST A CUSTOMER.
      
      
      I UNDERSTAND NOT THE RIGHT FORUM TO CRIB. BUT I HOPE SOMEWHERE PUBLIC SHAME WILL MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE SERVICE."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"I ALWAYS PREFER NOKIA MOBILES DUE TO ITS SOFTWARE FEATURES. ITS PC SUITE SOFTWARE WAS VERY GOOD AND WE CAN SYNCHRONIZE ALL OUR CONTACTS AND OTHER STUFFS BETWEEN OUR PC AND PHONE. WE CAN USE THE MOBILE AS A MODEM WHENEVER WE REQUIRE. WE CAN UPDATE THE OS USING GPRS/EDGE CONNECTIONS. THERE ARE MY SUCH FEATURES I HAVE NEVER FIND IN ANY OTHER MOBILE LIKE SAMSUNG ETC.
      
      
      BUT LUMIA 620 DOES NOT HAVE ALL THESE FEATURES. WE CANNOT UPDATE THE OS OR LANGUAGE PACK THROUGH ANY 2G OR 3G MOBILE INTERNET CONNECTION, AND WE NEED TO USE ONLY WI-FI NETWORK FOR THE SAME. I HAVE PURCHASED THE MOBILE ABOUT 3MONTH BACK AND TILL TODAY I COULD NOT UPDATE THE OS AND ITS LANGUAGE PACK AS WHEREVER I GOES I GETS A SECURED WI-FI CONNECTION AND I COULD NOT USE IT. NOW FOR UPDATING THE MOBILE OS I NEED TO BUY A WI-FI MODEM!
      
      
      WE CANNOT USE LUMIA 620 AS A MODEM USING THE USB CABLE OR BLUE TOOTH CONNECTION AS WE DO IT IN NOKIA PC SUITE. WE CAN SHARE THE INTERNET CONNECTION ONLY THROUGH A WI-FI NET WORK. I AM USING A 3G NET WORK CONNECTION WITH UNLIMITED INTERNET USAGE PACK AND I AM UNABLE TO CONNECT INTERNET THROUGH MY PC USING MY MOBILE AS A MODEM.
      
      
      I CANNOT STORE /SYNCHRONIZE MY MOBILE CONTACT IN TO MY PC USING THE WINDOWS PHONE APPLICATION FOR DESKTOP. ONLY MUSIC, VIDEOS AND PICTURES CAN SYNCHRONIZE.
      
      
      I CANNOT ATTACH ANY DOCUMENTS FROM MY WINDOWS PHONE WHILE SENDING MAILS, AND IF I FORWARD THE MAILS WITH ATTACHMENT TO A THIRD PARTY THE ATTACHMENT WILL BE MISSING. TO SEND THE MAIL WITH ATTACHMENT, FIST I HAVE TO OPEN THE ATTACHMENT (OPEN THE FULL MAIL COMMUNICATION) THEN TO FORWARD. WE CANNOT USE MAIL BOX LIKE OUTLOOK.
      
      
      WE CANNOT USE EVEN BASIC FEATURES OF MS OFFICE IN ITS MOBILE VERSION SUCH AS INCREASING CELL WIDTHS OR HEIGHTS, INSERTING NEW COLUMNS OR ROWS, ETC.
      
      
      WHEN MOBILE DISPLAY IN OFF MODE, IF ANY CALL COMES I CANNOT RECEIVE THE CALL DIRECTLY BY SLIDING UP AND THE FUNCTION DOES NOT WORKS SOME TIMES. FOR THAT I HAVE TO PRESS THE CENTER BUTTON TO MAKE THE MOBILE SILENT AND POWER SAVING MODE AND PRESS IT AGAIN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
      
      
      MOST OF THE NOKIA MOBILE HAS THE PROBLEM OF SOFTWARE HANGING, RE-BOOTING, ETC. AND ARE REGULAR PROBLEM FOR MANY OF THE  NOKIA PHONES. SOMETIMES I FELT THE SAME THINGS WITH MY LUMIA 620 ALSO. SOME TIMES THE MOBILE GETTING HEATED UP ABOVE NOMINAL LEVEL.
      
      
      
      I HAVE SHORT LISTED GALAXY S DUOS BEFORE BUYING LUMIA 620, HOWEVER HEARING ABOUT THE FEATURES OF WINDOWS 8 MOBILE VERSION I QUITE INTERESTED IN THAT AS IT WAS COMPARATIVELY A BUDGET PHONE FOR ME. SINCE MANY PEOPLE ARE USING ANDROID PHONES I LOOK FOR A CHANGE. SINCE I HAVE NOT USED ANDROID PHONES I CANNOT WRITE ANY COMPARISON BETWEEN ANDROID AND WINDOWS PHONE. HOWEVER NOW I THINK THAT GALAXY S DUOS WAS BETTER OPTION COMPARE TO THE LUMIA 620 CONSIDERING ITS LOOK AND FEEL, PRICE (IT IS ABOUT RS.2500/- LESS THAN LUMIA620), DUAL SIM CAPABILITY ( I AM USING 2 SIMS ONE FOR OFFICIAL AND OTHER ONE FOR PERSONEL) ETC."

Nokia Lumia 620,3,I BOUGHT A NOKIA LUMIA 620 FEW DAYS BACK AND IT HANGED A NUMBER OF TIMES DOES ANYONE KNOW AWHY IS THIS HAPPENING AND HOW I CAN STOP IT????????????????PLEASE ITS A SERIOS PROBLEM AND I AM LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE A MONTH AGO WITH LOT OF EXCITEMENT.NOKIA GIVEN BEST IN THIS PHONE BUT IT NEEDS LOT OF IMPROVEMENT INTERMS OF WINDOWS 8
      
      1. VOLUME BUTTON: IF WE CHANGE VOLUME OF MUSIC,IT EVEN CHANGES VOLUME OF INCOMING CALL
      
      2. VIBRATE+RING: IT VIBRATES THEN RINGS, ITS NOT VIBRATE AND RING
      
      3. APPS: APPS ARE NOT SO GOOD, NEEDS LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS
      
      4. MAPS: NOKIA MAPS ARE REALLY GOOD
      
      5. POWER BUTTON: THEY ARE NOT USING BUTTONS PROPERLY FOR MULTI-TASKING, LIKE POWER BUTTON ENDS CALLS ETC
      
      6. PUSH NOTIFICAITON: THERE ARE NO PUSH NOTIFICATIONS FOR MAILS AND ETC
      
      7. CALL HISTORY: CALL HISTORY WONT DISPLAY THE TIME DURATION AND EXACT CALL DETAILS
      
      8. SD CARD: THERE IS NO PROPER APP TO DISPLAY CONTENT PROPERLY
      
      9. OFFICE 365: IT WONT OPEN FILES WHICH HAS PASSWORD PROTECTED
      
      10. CONTACTS: CONTACTS CANT BE SAVED WITH MULTIPLE PHONE NUMBERS, IT HAS FIXED OPTOINS LIKE MOBILE MOBILE 2 ETC
      
      11. AUTO WORDS: AUTO WORDS ARE NOT COMING ALL THE TIMES WITH ALL APPLICATIONS"
Nokia Lumia 620,3,I BOUGHT THIS PHONE A MONTH BACK. IT IS SO SMOOTH AND FLUID. WINDOWS 8 IS AWESOME. DOWNLOADED LOT OF FREE APPS &AMP; GAMES TOO. THE ONLY BIG DISADVANTAGE IS THE PRIMARY 5 MPX CAMERA IS VERY POOR. A 2 MPX CAMERA WOULD BE BETTER. THE IMAGES COMES BLURRED IN DAYLIGHT. IF I KNEW THIS BEFORE I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT IT.
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"I DO NOT SAY THAT THIS IS THE BEST PHONE BUT THIS IS ONE SUCH PHONE WHICH YOU CAN DEFINITELY THINK OF BUYING.
      
      
      RESPONSE OF THE PHONE COMPARATIVELY MAY BE LOW BUT YOU DO NOT FEEL THAT WITH YOUR NAKED EYE.
      
      
      IT DOES HANGS SOMETIMES BUT SIMPLE TRICK IS JUST LOCK AND UNLOCK THE PHONE.
      
      
      WINDOWS PLATFORM IS STILL EVOLVING, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEARCH APPS WHICH YOU ARE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR, BUT CONSIDERING IT WINDOWS, SOME WAIT WOULD HELP.
      
      
      MEMORY CARS: I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO INSERT MEMORY CARD. ME AND MY FRIEND TRIED FOR 15 MINS AND GIVEN UP TO NOT TO BREAK MY NEW PHONE, I TOOK IT TO SERVICE CENTER, THERE ALSO THE GUY TRIED FOR 5 MINS AND HE WAS SUCCESSFUL AFTER THAT. STILL I AM WORRIED TO REMOVE THE CARD FROM THAT SLOT AGAIN. BUT ONCE INSERTED, I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE CASE TO REMOVE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO INSERT ANOTHER CARD.
      
      
      I AM STILL CONFUSED ON HOW TO GET CONTACTS STORED INSIDE SIM. CONFUSED ON HOW TO SEARCH FOR THEM.
      
      
      YOU CAN PLAY ONLY MP4 FORMAT VIDEO FILES. STILL WAITING FOR VLC TO COME UP WITH PLAYER FOR WP8.
      
      
      FLIPKART: NO ISSUES AT ALL FROM FLIPKART. FLIPKART ROCKS."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST ONE WEEK, I HAVE BOUGHT ONLY THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF THE HYPE FOUND IN THE INTERNET AND FLIP-KART MAINLY. MANY A TIMES THE PHONE FREEZES, I AM NOT ABLE TO LIFT CALLS, AND ALSO THE BACK BUTTON SOME TIMES DOESN'T RESPOND. IT HAS HAPPENED SO  MANY A BEFORE MY FRIENDS WHO STARTED LAUGHING BEFORE WHOM I SHOWED MY EXCITEMENT FOR BUYING A WINDOWS PHONE. BUY THIS PHONE ONLY U GOT BORED BY ANDROID. MY ANOTHER REASON TO BUY THIS PHONE IS DUE TO MY AFFECTION ON NOKIA WHICH IT KEPT ITS PROMISE BY MAKING THIS AMAZING LOOKING PHONE. I THINK THE PROBLEM IS WITH OS"
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART JUST A WEEK AGO FOR 13899 BUT NOW THE PRICE IS 12999.!
      
      ANYWAYS WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE PHONE. AT THE FIRST LOOK PHONE LOOKED AWESOME IN HANDS AS ITS HANDY TO HOLD AND OPERATE IN ONE HAND, CLEAR BACK DISPLAY IS GOOD BUT THE SIDE BUTTONS ARE NOT SMOOTH AT ALL. ITS MY FIRST WP EXPERIENCE AS I WAS USING ANDROID EARLIER FOR ALMOST 3 YEARS. LETS SEE THE MISSING VERY BASIC FEATURES I NOTICED IN THE PHONE.
      
      
      1. YOU DON'T HAVE 'EDIT NUMBER BEFORE CALL' OPTION WHICH SUCKS IN CRUCIAL TIME.
      
      2. IN CALL LOG (HISTORY) IF YOU HAVE ONE PARTICULAR NUMBER MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO SCROLL DOWN TO SEE WHEN YOU HAVE CALLED UNLIKE ANDROID PHONES WHERE YOU WILL SEE UNDER PARTICULAR NUMBER ALL THE DATES AND CALL DURATION.
      
      3. CALL DURATION IS COMPLETELY MISSING.
      
      4. WHILE TYPING THE NUMBER IN KEYPAD SUGGESTIONS FEATURES IS MISSING WHICH YOU GET IN SAMSUNG PHONES.
      
      5. BATTERY BACKUP IS NOT UP TO THE MARK.
      
      6. YOU TO DOWNLOAD SEPARATE APP FOR SHORTCUTS WHICH YOU CAN EASILY ACCESS IN SAMSUNG WITH JUST SWIPE FROM TOP (WIFI, BT, GPS, DATA, AUTO ROTATION, PROFILES ETC)
      
      7. APPS ARE LIMITED BUT MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR MODERATE USER.
      
      8. IN WHATSAPP U NEED MANY CLICKS TO ADD SMILEYS UNLIKE OTHER PHONES (HOPE IT WILL BE FIXED SOON)
      
      9. EVEN FOR BATTERY PERCENTAGE NEED TO DOWNLOAD SEPARATE APP WHICH YOU FIND ON THE BATTERY ICON ITSELF IN THE OTHER PHONES.
      
      10. MANY MORE BASICS
      
      
      THE PHONE IS AWESOME FEELS AWESOME IN HANDS AND DEFINITELY IT GIVES DIFFERENT FEEL FROM WHAT ANDROID IS EXCEPT THOSE FEATURES. AS THIS IS MY FIRST WP PHONE JUST LET ME KNOW IF I AM WRONG WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE FEATURES."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"I PURCHASHED THIS PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART 2 WEEKS BACK AND AS SCORES OF PEOPLE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED, THEIR SERVICE IS REALLY GOOD. I GOT THE PHONE SHIPPED WITHIN 3 WORKING DAYS OF PLACING ORDER.
      
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PHONE ITSELF, LUMIA 620 LOOKS ELEGANT AND ITS CLEAR BLACK SCREEN STANDS OUT. SO DOES THE WINDOWS 8 LIVE TILE INTERFACE.THE PROCESSOR IS FAST BUT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES SLOW WHILE DOING MULTITASKING. I HAVENT PLAYED GAMES ON THIS YET SO CANT TALK ABOUT THAT.
      
      
      BATTERY BACK UP IS NOT GREAT EVEN FOR A SMARTPHONE STANDARD. THE PHONE HANGS UP SOMETIMES AND RESTARTS ITSELF. (WINDOWS ACHILES HEEL)
      
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT THAT GREAT AND FRONT CAMERA REMINDS THAT OF NOKIA 6600.
      
      HOWEVER, FEATURES LIKE CINEMAGRAPH, PANORAMA ETC ARE DECENT.
      
      AUDIO QUALITY IS GOOD (ESPECIALLY CALLS). NOKIA HAS IMPROVED ON THIS FRONT.
      
      
      THE APP STORE FOR WIDOWS IS EVOLVING BUT NOT AS EXHASUTIVE AS THE ANDROID OR APPLE ECOSYSTEM. BUT ALL MAJOR REQUIRED APPS ARE AVAILABLE THERE.
      
      
      OVERALL, THE PHONE IS A DECENT BUY. BUT WONT RATE IT AS AWESOME EVEN AT THIS PRICE RANGE."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"I'M NOT A CERTIFIED BUYER FROM FLIPKART BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS FOR THE MOBILE!
      
      HERE WE GO-
      
      
      PROS-
      
      1.AMAZING GUI - DESPITE THE NEGATIVITY, ITS A VERY AMAZING PHONES. GENERALLY I THOUGHT THE LIVE TILES WILL MAKE IT A BORING APPEARANCE BUT IT'S AMAZING. THE TILES JUST GIVE YOU A NEW LOOK AND IS BETTER WHEN IT STARTS MOVING(PEOPLE TILES CHANGING WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLES IMAGE).
      
      
      2.SMOOTH TRANSITION - I REPEATEDLY KEEP SWIPING THE SCREEN LEFT AND RIGHT BECAUSE THE TRANSITIONS ARE JUST SO SMOOTH AND BUTTERY.
      
      
      3.LOCK SCREENS- THOUGH ITS NOT A NEW FEATURE STILL I LOVE THE WAY IT APPEARS.
      
      
      4.REMOVABLE COVERS- THIS IS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE TO TO LUMIA 620. BY CHANGING THE BACK COVER YOU CAN SIMPLY GIVE A MORE TRENDY LOOK TO YOUR LUMIA 620.
      
      
      5. PREDICTIVE TEXT- WHENEVER I WRITE A TEXT ON SMS OR FACEBOOK CHAT OR ANY OTHER SOCIAL APPS THE PREDICTIVE TEXTS ARE JUST AMAZING. I DON'T NEED TO TYPE THE WHOLE LETTER AS IT SUGGESTS A BUNCH OF WORDS ON TYPING TWO OR THREE LETTERS.
      
      
      CONS-
      
      1. NO RADIO- THOUGH YOU MAY THINK THAT MUSIC PLAYER WILL DO THE WORK STILL SOMETIMES YOU MAY FEEL LIKE LISTENING TO RADIO TALKIES AND MUSIC WHICH IS ABSENT  IN LUMIA 620.
      
      
      2.CAN'T SEND MUSIC AND VIDEOS- USUALLY SENDING MUSIC AND VIDEOS VIA BLUETOOTH IS THE EASIEST FEATURE WE DISCOVER IN A CELLPHONE BUT ON LUMIA 620 ITS NOT. I LOOKED EACH AND EVERY OPTION BUT I JUST CAN'T SEND MY MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH. THIS LEAVES A GR8 DISADVANTAGE.(IF ITS POSSIBLE THEN PLEASE WRITE A REVIEW)
      
      
      3.CAN'T PLAY MUSIC WHILE TALKING TO SOMEONE- ALTHOUGH THIS FEATURE IS NOT SO IMPORTANT STILL I PREFER THIS FEATURE TO BE AVAILABLE. BUT ITS ABSENT. ITS NO BIG DEAL.
      
      
      4.CAN'T RECORD CALLS- THIS IS A DISAPPOINTING THING. WHILE TALKING TO SOMEONE I DON'T GET THE OPTION TO RECORD THE CALLS AND THIS FEATURE IS EVEN AVAILABLE ON A RS.4000 CELL. I HOPE WINDOWS PHONE STORE SOLVES THIS ISSUE BY AVAILING SUCH CALL RECORDING APPS.
      
      
      5.WRITING TEXT IS A PAIN- WHEREVER YOU WRITE, SMS, CHAT, NOTE, CALENDER, INTERNET, ETC. TEXTS ARE A REAL PAIN, NOT BECOZ OF TYPING BUT BECOZ OF THE MISTAKE YOU MAY MAKE. SUPPOSE INSTEAD OF ""HELLO"" IF YOU HAVE WRITTEN ""HELO"" THEN INSERTING THE CURSOR JUST BEFORE THE 'O' IS NOT POSSIBLE. AS A RESULT, YOU WILL HAVE TO DELETE THE WHOLE TEXT. DISAPPOINTING :/
      
      
      THIS ARE SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT AMAZED ME AND ALSO DISAPPOINTED ME. BUT DON'T GET FINISHED HERE. THERE ARE LOT MORE THINGS ON LUMIA 620 WHICH WILL AMAZE YOU. SO JUST KEEP GAINING REVIEWS FOR THE MOBILE.
      
      
      OVERALL... ITS A SMART CHOICE FOR THOSE WHO ARE TIGHT IN BUDGET! BUT I GIVE IT A 3 STAR BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF RADIO(EVEN DOWNLOADING A RADIO APP DIDN'T SOLVE MY PROBLEM), NOT BEING ABLE TO SEND SONGS AND VIDEOS VIA BLUETOOTH AND MAKING THE TEXT WRITING A BIT COMPLICATE AND TOUGH(SO DON'T MAKE TYPING MISTAKE!)"
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"IN THE FEW DAYS USAGE , I FOUND THAT
      
      
      1)  THE POWER / SCREEN OFF (MIDDLE) BUTTON IS VERY HARD TO PRESS . WHENEVER I PRESS , IT PROPMTS ME TO SHUT DOWN THE PHONE . SCREEN OFF WILL  NOT WORK MANY TIMES
      
      
      2) ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO OPEN THE PANEL FOR CHANGING THE SIM/SD CARD . I HAVE TO THE PRESS THE CAMERA LENS HARD IN ORDER TO SEPARATE THE PANEL FROM THE BODY
      
      
      3)  THE BATTERY IS LOOSELY FITTED ON TO THE BODY.
      
      
      4)  USING WINDOWS 8 IS THE BEST PART."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"LUMIA 620 IS A GREAT PRODUCT BUT BIG DRAWBACK IS THE BATTERY , ON AVERAGE USE BATTERY HARDLY MAKES IT TO NIGHT  AFTER A EARLY MORNING FULL CHARGE , DISPLAY IS GREAT , WINDOWS 8 IS COOL , CAMERA IS AVERAGE . HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A MONTH , TOUCH FUNCTION IS GOOD BUT AT TIMES NOTICED IT DOES LAG , AT TIME UNABLE TO ATTEND TO INCOMING CALLS BECAUSE THE ANSWERS BUTTON DOES NOT WORK HAVE TO LOCK AND UNLOCK THE PHONE FOR IT TO WORK , SO FAR HAVE SEEN THE PHONE SWITCH OFF BY ITSELF 3 TIMES WITH ENOUGH BATTERY BACK UP. WHEN I RECEIVED THE PHONE IT WOULD NOT DETECT THE SD CARD , HAD CALLED UP FLIPKART , AS PER THEIR ADVICE HAD TO RESTORE TO FACTORY SETTING AND THEN SWITCH OFF AND SWITCH ON THE PHONE FOR THE SD CARD TO BE DETECTED BY THE PHONE , THKS FLIPKART ."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"MY REVIEW IS AS FOLLOWS:
      
      PROS:
      
      1. PHONE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AND WP8 LOOKS EVEN BETTER.
      
      2. BATTERY LIFE IS DECENT. LASTS ROUGHLY 20 HRS WITH DATA ON FOR NEARLY 13 HRS (SWITCH IT OFF AT NIGHT).
      
      3. CALL QUALITY AND SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      4. INTERNET BROWSING IS FAST.
      
      5. PHONE DOES NOT LAG EVEN WHILE PLAYING GAMES
      
      6. VERY GOOD CAMERA APPS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN PHOTOGRAPHY (LOMOGRAM, CAMERA 360, SMART SHOOT, CINEMAGRAPH, ETC.)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. NOT AS MANY APPS AS ANDROID OR IOS. MS NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING TO GET DEVELOPERS INTERESTED.
      
      2. AT JUST 3-4K MORE, LUMIA 720 SOUNDS A BETTER PROPOSITION.
      
      3. 512 MB RAM MEANS GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN NOT AVAILABLE - THATS OK WITH ME SINCE I AM NOT TOO MUCH OF A GAMER - BUT FOR MANY IT MATTERS.
      
      4. CAMERA FLASH IS TOO BRIGHT RESULTING IN BRIGHT PATCHES IN PHOTOS. I GET AROUND BY USING NOKIA SMARTSHOOT. I HAVE HEARD THIS HAS BEEN FIXED WITH THE NOKIA UPDATE, BUT YET TO TEST IT.
      
      5. NO FM RADIO HARDWARE SUPPORT..... ALL LUMIA PHONES HAVE THE HARDWARE FOR IT EXCEPT 620. EVEN 520 (BASICALLY IT MEANS THAT AFTER THE GDR2 PHONE UPDATE FROM WP8, FM RADIO WILL BE ENABLED FOR ALL LUMIAS EXCEPT 620) - WHAT THE HELL WAS NOKIA THINKING?????
      
      A GOOD MID-LEVEL PHONE IF YOU ARE NOT A HEAVY USER LIKE ME (INTERNET BROWSING, NEWS, FEW GAMES). BUT IF YOU CAN JUST STRETCH YOUR BUDGET A BIT, PROBABLY 720 MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"NOKIA LUMIA 620 AND SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE WERE IN SAME PRICE RANGE, BUT I BOUGHT LUMIA 620 (WP8) FOR NOKIA HW AND MS OS.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. GOOD H/W.
      
      2. BLUETOOTH FILE TRANSFER ALLOWED.
      
      3. MEMORY CARD ALLOWED.
      
      4. ALL HARD BUTTONS ARE PART OF OUTER CHANGEABLE CASE.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      I FIND SOME S/W LIMITATIONS OF WP8 LIKE :
      
      1. MANY VIDEO FORMATS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY DEFAULT PLAYER. AND NO OTHER PLAYER APP IS AVAILABLE.
      
      2. VOLUME CONTROL IS COMMON FOR RING VOLUME, MUSIC AND VIDEO PLAYER.(AND SOME TIMES YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE VOLUME)
      
      3. NO OTHER BROWSER OPTION AVAILABLE EXCEPT IE10 AND UC BROWSER(FAR BETTER).
      
      4. CANNOT USE NFC TO TRANSFER CONTENT WITH OTHER NFC ENABLED MOBILES (NOKIA TO NOKIA NEVER TRIED).
      
      5. MAY GET BORED DUE TO 1 HOME SCREEN THOUGH TILE SIZE AND POSITION CAN BE CHANGED.
      
      6. TILES ARE NOT INTERACTIVE AS GADGETS... THEY ARE JUST FOR DISPLAY OF DYNAMIC CONTENTS.
      
      7. NO FILE EXPLORER.
      
      
      SO ALL I WANT TO SAY IS GO FOR ANDROID IF ANY OF THE ABOVE S/W LIMITATION IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR YOU."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"NOKIA'S CONTRIBUTION TO LUMIA 620 IS GOOD. DECENT HARDWARE CONFIGURATION. BUT WINDOWS OS HAS SEVERAL CONS TOO.
      
      1.NO FILE EXPLORER. UNABLE TO BROWSE THROUGH FILES IN THE PHONE OR SD CARD.
      
      2. BACKGROUND TASKS REMAIN IN SUSPENDED STATE. IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR SOME APPLICATIONS BUT NOT ALL.
      
      3. AFTER I TRANSFERRED A PDF FILE TO MY PHONE BY BLUETOOTH I HAD NO CLUE WHERE WAS THE FILE STORED AND IT NOT POSSIBLE TO SEARCH FOR A PARTICULAR DOCUMENT.
      
      4. CALL DURATION IS NOT RECORDED.
      
      5. CALL RECORDING IS NOT POSSIBLE, EVEN A BASIC PHONE HAS IT
      
      6. NETWORK RECEPTION IS NOT THAT GOOD AS ITS EXPECTED FROM NOKIA
      
      7. BATTERY IS SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE.
      
      PROS
      
      PROS ARE
      
      1. SWIFT PERFORMANCE
      
      2. AWESOME GAMES

Nokia Lumia 620,3,"PURCHASED IT A WEEK BACK, OFF COURSE WAS LURED BY ITS FEATURES THAT TO AT A REASONABLE PRICE, THOUGH THE MOBILE IS PRETTY GOOD, WOULD LIKE TO CAUTION AGAINST POOR BATTERY PERFORMANCE OF IT. I DIDN'Y HAV KEPT ANY EXTRA-ORDINARY EXPECTATION, BUT WISHED THAT ONCE IT IS CHARGED AT 9 AM, IT SHOULD LAST AT LEAST TILL 9 PM, BUT TO MY UNPLEASANT SURPRISE IT DIES AT 4-5 PM ITSELF, WITH AVE USE OF: FACEBOOK 15-20 MIN, VOICE CALLS 1-1.30 HR, SURFING 20-30 MIN.
      
      
      THOUGH REST ALL FUNCTIONS ARE PRETTY GOOD, BUT CONSIDER ABOVE FACTOR WHILE MAKING YOUR PURCHASE. I TOO TRIED TO SEARCH ABOUT BATTERY PERFORMANCE OF LUMIA, BUT VERY FEW REVIEWS WERE AVAILABLE."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"THE PHONE IS AMAZING. SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE USUAL DROIDS OUT THERE. THE BATTERY SUCKS, JUST 1300MAH. GREAT UI, DOESNT HAVE AN EXPLORER FOR DRIVES THOUGH. DISPLAY IS QUITE GOOD. OVERALL A SATISFACTORY PHONE. IT WAS DELIVERED THE NEXT DAY AFTER PLACING THE ORDER. GOOD JOB ON THAT."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"USER INTERFACE LOOKS GOOD, SOME USEFUL APPS ARE NOT WELL DEVELOPED AS OF NOW.. LIKE ADOBE READER ETC..
      
      
      DECENT CAM, SOLID HARDWARE AT THIS PRICE, GOOD TOUCH EXPERIENCE
      
      
      NOKIA MAPS NOT THAT GREAT LIKE GOOGLE (CAN'T EXPECT THOUGH)...
      
      
      I CANT ACCESS OFFICE FILES STORED ON MY MEM CARD THROUGH THE MS OFFICE APPLICATION, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT WORK IF I COPY IT TO PHONE MEMORY BUT STILL IT DIDN'T (SAME WITH THE PRESENT PDF READER). IT WILL SHOW/OPEN THE PPT/PDF FILE ONLY IF U DOWNLOAD... MOST PAINFUL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE.. IF ANYONE HAS A SOLUTION LET ME KNOW...
      
      
      FOR ME OS HANGED TWICE IN FIRST 3 DAYS... NOT AFTER THAT..
      
      
      REST EVERYTHING IS FINE ABOUT IT.."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"USING FROM 40 DAYS N TESTED EACH AND EVERY FEATURE IT POSSES, I FEEL LIKE IM ELIGIBLE TO WRITE A REVIEW.
      
      
      U GONNA FEEL BAD FOR WINDOWS STORE AT START BUT YOU WILL FIND EVERY USEFUL APP IN THE STORE. ALL YOU NEED IS A LITTLE PATIENCE IN FINDING THEM. SOME POPULAR APPS ARE NOT UP TO THE MARK IN WP8. WHATSAPP AND VIBER AND FACEBOOK ARE SOME OF THEM.STILL U CAN FIND ALTERNATIVES FOR THEM.
      
      
      NO TEMPLE RUN .. PEOPLE ARE YELLING THIS . STILL HAVE SOME COOL GAMES AND ADDICTIVE ONES . XBOX IS A BOOST FOR THIS WP8.
      
      
      PLUS OF THIS PHONE IS EVEN AFTER HAVING 26 APPS INSTALLED AND  OF THEM  RUNNING IN BACK GROUND THERE WILL 350 MB OF RAM FREE AND APPS WORKS SMOOTH . I AM A HEAVY USER SO MULTI-TASKING OF ME SOME TIMES HANGS THE PHONE .. HAPPENED 2 TIMES. LOCK SCREEN SWIPE HAS SOME PROBLEMS WHEN ON MULTITASKING
      
      BATTERY OF THIS PHONE IS OKAY . 1300 MAH IS NOT GOOD FOR THIS PHONE BUT GIVES A BACK UP OF AROUND 6 HOURS OF HEAVY USAGE 14 HOURS OF NORMAL USAGE AND YEAH 200 + HOURS WITH 40 MINUTES OF 2G CALLING. 720 N 520 BATTERIES ARE BETTER . ON WIFI,GPRS,BLUETOOTH,WIFISHARING,NFC AND APPS RUNNING IN BACK GROUND IT WILL BE FOR 6 HOURS MAX . BETTER THAN UN ROOTED ANDROID PHONE WHICH ONLY LASTS 4 HOURS WITH ME .
      
      
      READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS AND YEAH IT HAS NO FILE MANGER,CANT SHARE MUSIC N VIDEOS .. HOPE FOR A UPDATE ON THIS FROM WP8. UNLESS THIS PLATFORM OPENS UP WP8 USERS GONNA HAVE SOME TOUGH TIME.

      I BET YOU EVERYONE WILL ASK TO SEE YOUR PHONE UNLIKE OTHER ANDROID PHONES COMMON EVERY WHERE. HOPE FOR SOME UPDATES ."
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"WELL THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW AND I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR PAST 20 DAYS. I PURCHASED WHITE COLOR LUMIA 620 FROM LOCAL DEALER AT 13,800, SO ON FLIPKART AT 14230 WITH 16 GB MEMORY CARD IS GREAT DEAL. I HAVE MIGRATED FROM ANDROID.
      
      
      NOW THESE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS, WHICH I FEEL MUST BE KNOWN TO ITS PERSPECTIVE BUYERS:
      
      
      1- BUILD: THE BUILD QUALITY IS EXCELLENT. IT GRIPS WELL IN YOUR HAND AND HAVE ROUND CORNERS. THE BACK COVER FEELS LIKE IT HAS SOME BACK GUARD PUT ON IT.
      
      
      2- CAMERA: EXCELLENT IN OUTDOORS, MODERATE IN INDOORS WITH LIGHTS ON, FLASH IS NOT UP TO THE MARK AT INDOORS. FEW PICTURES WERE TOO GRAINY AT INDOORS.
      
      
      3- SPEAKERS: EXCELLENT, LOUD CRYSTAL CLEAR SOUND. NOKIA HAS REALLY IMPROVED IN TERMS OF SPEAKER QUALITY.
      
      
      4- SCREEN: GOOD, CLEARBACK DISPLAY WITH OPTION TO AUTO ADJUST BRIGHTNESS.
      
      
      5- BATTERY: LASTS MORE THAN A DAY WITH CONSTANT WIFI ON AND MODERATE USAGE.
      
      
      6- CALL QUALITY: GOOD WITH NO DISTORTION HEARD AT BOTH ENDS.
      
      
      7- LAG: ALTHOUGH THIS HAS ONLY 512 MB RAM IT DOES NOT LAG.
      
      
      CONS OR ISSUES
      
      
      1- RINGER VOLUME: RING VOLUME AND MEDIA PLAYER VOLUME ARE LINKED, IF WHILE PLAYING SONG YOU TURN THE VOLUME DOWN TO 15 ON THE SCALE OF 0-30, THE RINGTONE ALSO AUTOMATICALLY TURNS DOWN TO 15 SO YOU MIGHT MISS SOME CALLS.
      
      
      2- VIDEO CALLS: IT DOES NOT SUPPORT 3G NETWORK VIDEO CALLS THOUGH IT HAS FRONT CAMERA. FOR MAKING VIDEO CALLS YOU MUST USE APPS LIKE SKYPE.
      
      
      3- APPS LIST: ONE YOU INSTALLED 40 OR SO APPS IT AUTOMATICALLY SORTS THEM IN A-Z LIST, NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF.
      
      
      4- SMART DIALER: SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO CALL ""HOME"" SO YOU CAN`T PRESS 4663 AND LIST DOWN MATCHING SUGGESTIONS. YOU MAY USE APPS LIKE TRUE DIALER TO ACHIEVE THIS BUT WINDOWS OS DOES NOT ALLOWS THEM ACCESS TO MISSED AND RECEIVED CALLS.
      
      
      5- FILE MANAGER: THIS PHONE DOES NOT HAVE A FILE MANAGER. SUPPOSE YOU HAVE COPIED 10 PDF/WORD FILES FROM YOUR PC TO PHONE, IT MIGHT NOT RECOGNIZE ALL OF THEM AND MIGHT SHOW ONLY SOME OF THEM IN PDF READER/OFFICE.
      
      
      6- APPS: MANY IMPORTANT APPS ARE NOT YET PORTED TO WINDOWS 8 FROM ANDROID. MANY APPS WHICH ARE FREE IN OTHER OS ARE NOT FREE.
      
      
      7- TORRENT: IT DOES NOT SUPPORT TORRENT CLIENT TO DOWNLOAD TORRENTS DIRECTLY TO PHONE.
      
      
      8- PHOTO ON DIALER: WHILE DIALING ANY CONTACT IT DOES NOT SHOW ITS PHOTO ON SCREEN, WHILE RECEIVING CALL IT DOES SHOWS PHOTO.
      
      
      9- FLASH PLAYER: IT SUPPORTS ADOBE FLASH PLAYER LITE ONLY, SO YOU CAN`T WATCH LIVE STREAMS LIKE LIVE IPL STREAMED ON YOUTUBE. NORMAL  YOUTUBE UPLOADED VIDEOS WORKS FINE.
      
      
      10- MEDIA PLAYER: NOKIA PLAYER IS GOOD BUT DOESN`T SUPPORTS MKV FORMAT. MX PLAYER IS YET NOT AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS PLATFORM.
      
      
      11- CRASHES: WHILE VISITING SITES WHICH USE HEAVY FLASH, BROWSER MAY CRASHES DISPLAYING 3 SEC VIDEO OF SAYING ""RECOVERING MEMORY"". IT HAPPENED TO ME QUITE A FEW TIMES.
      
      
      12- BACK COVER: WHITE BACK COVER IS GOOD BUT GETS DIRTY VERY SOON GIVING IT AN OLD LOOK.
      
      
      13- CALL LOG: IT DOES NOT DISPLAY CALL SUMMARY AFTER CALL. DOES NOT DISPLAY HOW MUCH YOU TALKED ON ONE PARTICULAR CALL. ALSO IF YOU CALLED ""HOME"" 10 TIMES IT SHOWS ""HOME"", ""HOME"", ""HOME"" ..... 10 TIMES.
      
      
      14- MESSAGING: GOOGLE CHAT IS NOT INTEGRATED TO IT, YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD EXTERNAL APP TO CHAT. SINCE MANY OF US USE GOOGLE SERVICES, I FELT THIS OPTION SHOULD BE THERE.
      
      
      15- AUTO ROTATE: THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN AUTO-ROTATE OFF.
      
      
      16- RING PROFILES: THERE ARE NOT ANY RING PROFILES SUCH AS GENERAL, SILENT, MEETING ETC. YOU HAVE TO TURN VOLUME ALL WAY DOWN TO ACHIEVE SILENT/VIBRATE ONLY MODE.
      
      
      17- NO FM
      
      
      18- NO NOTIFICATION PANEL
      
      
      19- TO SKIP FORWARD A SONG TO PARTICULAR INSTANT ON SONG TIMELINE YOU CANT TAP ON IT, YOU HAVE TO PRESS AND HOLD NEXT.
      
      
      20- CALLING SOMEONE IS A LENGTHY PROCESS... Z...Z...Z..
      
      
      VERDICT: ALTHOUGH LUMIA 620 HAS FEW ISSUES, BUT THESE ARE NOT SHORTCOMINGS, THEY CAN BE FIXED AS AN UPDATE OR NEW APPS CAN BE MADE TO ACHIEVE MORE FUNCTIONALITY.
      
      
      SO IF YOU HAVE NOT USED ANDROID AND WANTS TO OWN A SMARTPHONE OR IF YOU ARE NOT A PRO USER, THIS PHONE IS FOR YOU. AMAZING UI, GREAT FEATURES FOR NORMAL USE, MID RANGE BEST SMARTPHONE YOU CAN GET.   :)"
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"WHEN I COMPARE  PHONE WHICH IS BEST ANDROID OR WINDOWS
      
      WHICH IS BEST IN USER INTERFACE?
      
      WHICH IS BEST FOR TRANSFER PHOTOS,VIDEOS IN OTHER MOBILE SUCH ANDROID?
      
      PLEASE TELL OPINION ABOUT WINDOWS AND ANDROID USERS IM WAITING FOR BUY A NEW PHONE"
Nokia Lumia 620,3,"YES I HAVE JELLY BEAN OS GALAXY ,BLACKBERRY AND IPHONE.. FASCINATED BY REVIEWS AND DESIRE TO TRY SOMETHING NEW I REACHED FOR THIS MOBILE.
      
      THE SPECS ARE GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY, DECENT CAMERA , NOKIAS STURDY BRAND AND FRESH OS WAS SIMPLY IRRESTITABLE TO LET IT GO..I LOVE TINKERING WITH APPS AND EVERY NOW AND THEN TRY NEW APPS..
      
      STRONG POINTS
      
      1) FAST OS NO HANGING ( BUT U WILL ENCOUNTER THEM OCCASIONALLY ONCE A WEEK)
      
      2) NOKIA MUSIC AND PODCASTS ARE AMAZING. EXPANDS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE PHONE TO WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
      
      3) PEOPLE APP INSTEAD OF CONTACTS IS WELCOME AND WILL CLEAR THE CLUTTER.
      
      4)THE FEEL AND FINISH OF THE PHONE IS PREMIUM
      
      5) THE SCREEN IS VERY BRIGHT (ONE OF THE BEST) HAS SUNLIGHT READABILITY
      
      
      6) ON BLUETOOTH IT READS THE SMS FOR YOU AND YOU CAN REPLY IN SPEECH.. VERY NICE WHILE DRIVING
      
      WHAT SCREWS IS IT...
      
      
      1)TO CALL SOME ONE IS A PAIN.
      
      UNLOCK PHONE - PRESS PHONE- GO DOWN PRESS CONTACT BOOK- PRESS SEARCH BUTTON- TYPE NAME- SELECT NAME- PRESS CALL MOBILE ( 7 STEPS TO CALL THE PERSON , WINDOWS IS CRAZY, I MEAN I HAD E71 AND LONG PRESS 2 WOULD GET TO MY HOME NUMBER IN ONE SEC.. OHH PLEASE U CANT PIN THE WHOLE DIRECTORY TO FIRST PAGE).. THE BASIC FUNCTION OF PHONE IS PAINFULL..
      
      
      2) DRAINS BATTERY - WITH 3G ON, BLUETOOTH ON AND ALL OTHER LIKE WIFI, GPS, NFC BACKGROUND APPS OFF THE PHONE LASTS MERE 8 HOURS. I HAVE STARTED USING EVERYTHING ON SOS BASIS. I SWITCH ON AND OFF BLUETOOTH, WIFI AND 3G ATLEAST 20 TIMES A DAY.. I MEAN WHO WANTS TO TAKE TENSION YAAR 3G ON RAH GAYA BATTERY KHATAM HO JAYEGA IN LIFE..
      
      
      3) IT ROBS AND DOESNT TELL YOU.. SOME SHITTY BACKGROUND GOES ON. MY FIRST MONTH DATA BILL WAS RS 4565, I AM ON POST PAID AND MY 3G EXCEEDED IN LIKE A WEEK. DAT SENSE IS USELESS.
      
      ONLY WAY IT WORKS IS LIKE BANIYA YOU HAVE SWITCH ON DATA AND SWITCH OFF DATA. ANDROID GIVES SO MUCH FLEXIBILTY HERE.
      
      
      4) CAMERA HAS A GOOD DELAY OF 2 SECS, THATS WHY THEY HAVE SHITTY APPS TO CATCH PERFECT MOMENT COS THEY KNOW U HAVE ALREADY LOST IT. QUALITY IN LITTLE SUNLIGHT OR DARKNESS IS VERY VERY POOR. MAY BE DOES A GOOD JOB IN STUDIO LIGHTING.
      
      
      5) TRY TO SAVE A NUMBER DURING CALL, U WILL BE SHITTING BRICKS..
      
      
      6) CUT PASTE FUNCTION IS VERY POOR, AFTER YOU PASTE IT, IT GETS DELETED AND U HAVE TO GO AND COPY IT  AGAIN TO PASTE ONE MORE TIME. NO CLIPBOARD IS AVAILABLE (ANDROID I MISS YOU SO MUCH)
      
      
      7) FILE MANAGER .. INCREDIBLY NEEDED APP. I DONT KNOW WHERE MY FILES ARE AND I CAN T SEND OR ACCESS THEM.. IT S SCARY IF U CANT SEE UR PHONE FILES NAKED.. NOT EVEN A BASIC FILE DIRECTORY..( YES YES SOME GENIUS WILL GIVE IT TO ME IN SOME CRAZY UPDATE OR I HAVE TO PAY AND DO AWAY WITH EXISTING ONES)
      
      
      FOR SAKE OF BREVITY I AM NOT TOUCHING - GAMES , APPS AVAILABILITY, PHONE SECURITY, TRUE CALLER DOESNT WORK AND SO MANY OTHER MUNDANE THINGS
      
      
      I CONCLUDE .. THAT THE ASSUMPTION YOU WILL BUY THE PHONE AND FEE LIKE MAHARAJA IS JUST A MIRAGE.. U WILL BE STRUGGLING WITH IT AND EVENTUALLY ACCEPT IS YOUR FATE"
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"19 MAY 2013
      
      I HAD BEEN USING SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE,FOR 7 MONTHS. LAST WEEK IT WAS STOLEN SO HAD TO BUY A NEW PHONE. AFTER SEEING SUCH A GOOD REVIEWS ON FLIPKART AND SOME OTHER WEBSITES, I BOUGHT LUMIA 620 . IT IS REALLY AN AWESOME PHONE. EASILY FITS IN HAND. CLEAR BLACK DISPLAY MAKES VIEWING EXPERIENCE AWESOME. MUSIC QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD BUT EAR PHONES ARE CHEAP. THEY DO NOT FIT IN EARS. THE PHONE DOESN'T HAVE FM. ABSENCE OF FILE MANAGER MAKES THIS PHONE USELESS. MANY FILES DISAPPEARS EVEN THESE ARE SUPPORTED FILE TYPES (MP4, JPEG). SOME USERS HAVE SAID THAT 512MB OF RAM IS ENOUGH FOR WP. THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT DOES LAG MANY TIMES. NOT TO TALK ABOUT MULTI TASKING, IT EVEN CAN NOT KEEP TWO TABS ALIVE. WHEN I SWITCH BACK TO BACKGROUNDED TAB/APP, THE TAB OR APP RE-STARTS. CAMERA QUALITY IS ALSO NOT AS GOOD AS OF S ADVANCE'S. FRONT CAMERA STANDS NOWHERE IN FRONT OF THAT OF S ADVANCE. WP OS IS NEW SO IT DOESN'T HAVE SO MANY APPS. MANY FAMOUS AND POPULAR APPS &AMP; GAMES ARE MISSING EVEN AFTER TWO YEARS OF IT'S INCEPTION. IT DOESN'T HAVE SAME OR ALIKE STATUS BAR OF ANDROID. PHOTO UPLOADING IS NOT SUPPORTED BY IE IN MOBILE VERSION OF FACEBOOK SITE. CAN'T SEND SONGS OR VIDEOS THROUGH WHATSAPP. IF WANT TO SEND ANY AUDIO, WILL HAVE TO RECORD. NO OPTION OF SENDING PRE-RECORDED AUDIO/VIDEO. BATTERY JUICE IS NOT ENOUGH TO LAST MORE THAN 5 HOURS IN CONTINUOUS 3G BROWSING.
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS GOOD ONLY IN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION, BUT PRACTICALLY IT IS NOT MUCH GOOD. I AM THINKING OF SELLING MY LUMIA 620. GALAXY S ADVANCE AND MICROMAX A116 CANVAS HD ARE BETTER OPTION IN SAME PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      20 MAY 2013
      
      THE PHONE HAS STARTED SHOWING ITS COLOURS. TODAY, IT REBOOTED 3 TIMES, AUTOMATICALLY. NOKIA SHOULD HAVE PATENTED THE 'HANGING' AND 'RE-BOOTING' PROBLEM."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"AFTER USING NOKIA LUMIA 620 WINDOWS PHONE FOR THE PAST 1.5 MONTHS A LOT OF GOOD AND BAD THINGS CAME TO LIGHT. THE MAIN REASON BEHIND BUYING A WINDOWS PHONE, AFTER A LOT OF DIS-ENCOURAGEMENT FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY, WAS THE THE METRO UI. THE ONE-TONE COLOUR COMBINATIONS WITH DARK OR LIGHT BACKGROUND ALONG WITH THE LIVE-TILE MAKE THE PHONE AESTHETICALLY BEAUTIFUL. ON THAT, SMOOTH ANIMATION ACTS LIKE CHERRY ON TOP. THE USE OF TYPO IS NICE. SEGOE UI FONT GIVES WINDOWS PHONE THE-MAX-READABILITY.  THE INNOVATIVE IN-BUILD APPS, LIKE NOKIA OFFLINE MAPS AND CITY LANCE IS EYE-CANDY FOR TEC-FRICK USERS. MAILS SYNCHRONIZES PERFECTLY.
      
      NOKIA LUMIA 620 CAPTURES FRESH PICTURES AND IT OFFERS DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND QUALITY. BATTERY LIFE IS SIMILAR TO ALL SMARTS PHONE IN ITS RANGE BUT SURPRISINGLY IT RE-CHARGES PRETTY FAST. NOKIA HAS PLAYED ITS PART MODERATELY WELL EXCEPT NETWORK RECEPTION PROBLEM WHICH I AM FACING.
      
      THE MAIN HICCUPS START WHEN YOU START USING IT.
      
      1) IGNORE NUMBER/CONTACT: I CANNOT BLOCK A PHONE NUMBER OF MY MOST ANNOYING FRIEND WHO CALLS AT 2 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ON WEEKDAYS. I COULD NOT EVEN FIND A THIRD PARTY APP FOR IT.
      
      2) WE SHOULD ABLE TO PIN ANY SETTING OPTION TO THE START: IT TAKES 6 STEPS/ACTIONS TO UNLOCKING YOUR PHONE AND SWITCH ON/OFF BLUETOOTH IF U ARE NOT USING A THIRD PARTY APP TO CREATE BLUETOOTH SHORTCUT. WHO HAS THAT MUCH TIME?
      
      3) AUDIO FILES DOWNLOADED FROM THIRD PARTY APPS (WHATSAPP OR WECHAT) DO NOT SAVE IN ANY FOLDER.
      
      4) WINDOWS PHONE DEFAULT PLAYER IS NOT IMPRESSIVE. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CREATE A PLAYLIST. I COULD NOT FIGURE IT OUT YET. YOU CAN MAKE A SONG AS UR FAVOURITE BUT YOU WON'T FIND A PLAYLIST NAMED 'FAVOURITES'. WHAT'S THE USE THEN? THERE IS A PROBLEM IN MULTIPLICATION OF AUDIO LIST. EACH SONG IN MY COLDPLAY FOLDER SHOWS 24TIMES!! I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE FACING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH NO REMEDY.
      
      5) CANNOT MOVE IMAGES FROM ONE ALBUM/FOLDER TO ANOTHER. YOU CANNOT CREATE FOLDER OR ALBUM FROM PHONE ITSELF.
      
      6) CUSTOMISABLE SOUND VOLUME:  THE MOST ANNOYING THING THAT I HAVE FOUND SO FAR IS THE SOUND VOLUME. IT DO NO HAVE SEPARATE VOLUME CONTROLLER FOR MUSIC/VIDEO PLAYER, GAMES AND RINGTONE. INSTEAD IT HAS ONE MASTER VOLUME CONTROLLER WHICH YOU CAN MANIPULATE BY PRESS THE VOLUME UP-DOWN BUTTONS ON THE PHONE BODY. IF YOU SET YOU PHONE VOLUME 30 THAT MEANS UR PLAYER, GAME SOUND AND YOUR RING TONE SOUND ALL SET TO VOLUME 30. IMAGINE YOU ARE LISTENING TO SONGS IN YOUR OFFICE WITH HEADPHONES ON, IN HIGH VOLUME, AND SUDDENLY SOMEONE CALLS YOU.
      
      7) USUALLY SLOW, SLOWER WHEN MULTITASKING. WHENEVER YOU ARE USING AN APP, LET?S SAY NOKIA DRIVE OR WHATSAPP OR INTERNET EXPLORER. WHENEVER YOU MINIMIZE THE APPLICATION AND THEN MAXIMIZE IT BACK IT TAKES SOME TIME TO RESUME. IT IS VERY ANNOYING WHEN YOU ARE IN A HURRY.
      
      8) PHONE HAS RESTARTED MULTIPLE TIMES EVEN WHEN I AM JUST USING WATSAPP OR VIEWING A TEXT MESSAGE. MY HANDSET DOES NOT HAVE MUCH DATA. 6GB FREE SPACE IN PHONE MEMORY AND 7/8GB FREE IN SD, STILL PHONE HAS FREEZED SEVERAL TIMES.
      
      
      9) *****IT HAS NETWORK RECEPTION PROBLEM******
      
      
      MY GIRLFRIEND IS USING LUMIA 820 WHICH IS COMPARATIVELY FASTER BUT SHE HAS FACED THE RESTART AND FREEZE PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES. SHE ALSO FACES PROBLEM IN NETWORK RECEPTION.
      
      I WAS A GREAT FAN OF THE WINDOWS METRO UI? NOW I AM NOT. I WISH I HAD BOUGH SOMETHING ELSE."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"FIRST, WP8 IS NOWHERE CLOSE TO IOS OR ANDROID. THE TILE UI IS COOL BUT THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY POSITIVE THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT WP8. THERE'RE A COUPLE OF COOL APPS FROM NOKIA (DRIVE AND MUSIC) BUT THEY DON'T COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF APPS FOR A LOT OF OTHER THINGS A SMARTPHONE'S SUPPOSED TO DO. LET ME LIST OUT THE BAD STUFF -
      
      
      1) YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO A PC TO MANAGE YOUR MUSIC.
      
      2) THERE'S NO FILE MANAGER APP. YOU CANNOT MANAGE STORAGE ON YOUR SD CARD WITHOUT CONNECTING TO A PC.
      
      3) YOU CAN UPLOAD PICS AND VIDEOS, DOCS AND APP LISTS DIRECTLY TO SKYDRIVE (YOU GET 7 GB OF FREE CLOUD STORAGE) BUT THERE'S NO OPTION TO UPLOAD MUSIC. THAT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO USE WITH NOKIA'S UNLIMITED MUSIC SUBSCRIPTION FOR 6 MONTHS. YOU DOWNLOAD WHATEVER YOU WANT AND ARCHIVE IT IN THE CLOUD.
      
      4) THE FACEBOOK APP BY MS SUCKS. I DON'T SEE NOTIFICATIONS FOR MESSAGES OR FRIEND REQUESTS. OTHER FACEBOOK APPS ARE EQUALLY BAD.
      
      5) THERE'S NO QUORA APP (YET).
      
      6) CONTACT SYNC WITH GMAIL DOESN'T WORK. I CAN ONLY SEE EMPTY PROFILES OF GMAIL CONTACTS (NO PHONE NUMBERS OR EMAIL IDS).
      
      7) NO TEMPLE RUN. NO INSTAGRAM.
      
      8) FREQUENT CRASHES.
      
      
      FURTHER, THIS PHONE SUFFERS FROM HIGHER THAN NORMAL RETURN RATES.
      
      
      I MYSELF RECEIVED A DEFECTIVE PIECE. IT WORKED FOR A WEEK BUT WITH BATTERY PROBLEMS. BATTERY WOULD DRAIN OUT EXTREMELY QUICKLY - 100% TO 25% IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. SUDDENLY, YESTERDAY THE PHONE WOULDN'T TURN ON. I TRIED CHARGING IT FOR HALF-HOUR BUT IT STILL WOULDN'T TURN ON. I CALLED FLIPKART ABOUT THIS AND ALSO TOLD THEM ABOUT HOW IT COULD BE A FAULTY BATTERY.
      
      
      THEY ASKED ME TO CONFIRM THIS FROM A NOKIA CARE CENTER AND GET A DOA TO GET A REPLACEMENT. I'VE BEEN TO THREE NOKIA CARES AND PRIORITY CENTERS AND NOBODY WOULD GIVE ME A DOA CERTIFICATE. WHEN I INFORMED FLIPKART ABOUT THIS, THEY TOLD ME THEY ESCALATED THE ISSUE TO SOME HIGHER DEPARTMENT AND I SHOULD EXPECT TO RECEIVE A CALL FROM THEM IN A DAY. CALLED THEM TODAY AND THEY ASK ME TO WAIT ANOTHER 24 HRS.
      
      
      THE SAD THING IS THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GIFT TO MY MOM. I REALLY HOPE FLIPKART RESOLVES THIS SOMEHOW."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"HOW MANY APPS CAN BE INSTALLED IN 512 MB RAM OF LUMIA SERIES PHONES? ARE THERE ANY RESTRICTIONS AS SUCH THAT AFTER INSTALLING A NUMBER OF APPS IT WILL REFUSE TO INSTALL NEW APPS OR SIMPLY THE PHONE'S SPEED WILL COME DOWN DRASTICALLY? IT HAPPENS IN MY ANDROID, SO I WANT TO CLARIFY BEFORE INVESTING IN THIS PHONE! ANYONE?"
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"I BOUGHT NOKIA LUMIA 620 TODAY , BUT HAS SOME DISAPPOINTMENT WHILE USING THE PHONE, WHEN I AM USING THE PHONE IT IS GETTING STUCK-UP IN BETWEEN AND NO RESPONSE EVEN WHEN I TRY TO SWITCH OFF THE MOBILE USING THE POWER BUTTON AND I NEED TO REMOVE THE BATTERY TO RESTORE IT TO WORKING CONDITION."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2 MONTHS BACK, INITIALLY IT WAS WORKING WELL AND GUD, BUT SUDDENLY I FACED A PROBLEM. IT WILL SUDDENLY START VIBRATING AND WILL NOT STOP EVEN IF U SWITCH IT OFF. I GOT THAT PROBLEM 1 MONTH BACK, BUT IGNORED BECAUSE IT DDNT HPN FREQUENTLY, BUT AFTER 15 DAYS AGAIN I STARTED SEEING IT HPNING SO GAVE IT FOR REPAIR. GIVING IT 3 START FOR CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY, HERE DRIVE AND FOR GUD ENF SPEED WITH 512 MB RAM AND 1GH PROCESSOR."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AS A PRESENT FOR MY WIFE. IT'S A NICE LOOKING PHONE, HOWEVER SHE DOES NOT LIKE IT AND HAS REVERTED BACK TO HER 4 YEAR OLD QWERTY PAD PHONE. SO NOW I HAVE RS15K OF PHONE LYING IN A DRAWER. THIS PHONE IS NOT PARTICULARLY USER FRIENDLY- KEEPS SWITCHING OFF AND DISPLAYING A SD CARD ERROR. AND ITS JUST 2 WEEKS OLD."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE 3 DAYS BACK AND FOUND THAT THE PHONE IS A SHIT!!
      
      NO DOUBT THIS IS A GOOD PACKAGE EXCEPT  THAT THE BATTERY NEVER LASTED MORE THAN 3 HOURS WHEN I USE THE INTERNET. WHAT DOES A SMARTPHONE MEANS WITHOUT INTERNET? AND WHEN MY INTERNET IS ON MY BATTERY COMPLETELY DRAINS IN JUST 3 HOURS. SO THINK BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"I PURCHASED LUMIA 620 FROM FLIPKART ABOUT 3 MONTHS BACK . FOR LAST  2  WEEKS , WE HAVE BEEN FACING SOME BIZZARE PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE. IT REBOOTS AFTER EVERY 2 MINUTES. I HAVE VISITED NOKIA CARE CENTRE TWICE AND STILL NO SOLUTION. I WILL BEAR THE LOSS MYSELF AS NOKIA DOES NOT CARE ONCE THEY HAVE RECEIVED PAYMENT. YOU CANNOT EVEN SWITCH ON IT. THERE HAS BEEN ALWAYS OVER HEATING PROBLEM WITH PHONE AS IT HAS PATHETIC BATTERY. BUY AT YOUR RISK! THERE ARE MANY GOOD ANDROID PHONES WHICH WILL BE A BETTER CHOICE."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE IN THE MONTH OF APRIL. EVER SINCE THEN, I HAVE BEEN VISITING NOKIA CARE CENTER EVERY WEEKEND DUE TO SOME OR OTHER ISSUES. THEY UPDATED MY PHONE MANY TIMES. EVEN THEN, SINCE THE ISSUES WERE NOT FIXED COMPLETELY, THEY SENT IT TO CHENNAI AND AFTER 12 DAYS, GAVE ME A REPLACEMENT. THEN IN THE NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE INTERNET SHARING WAS NOT WORKING. I WAS NOT ABLE TO SHARE THE INTERNET WITH MY LAPTOP. THEY SAID THEY HAVE TO SEND IT TO CHENNAI(HEAD OFFICE) AGAIN TO FIX IT. I HAVE TO SURRENDER MY PHONE AGAIN @NOKIA CARE AND WAIT TILL IT COMES BACK FROM CHENNAI. I WOULD NOT SAY LUMIA 620 IS A BAD ONE. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS NOT A GREAT PHONE EITHER. THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE...FED UP OF VISITING NOKIA CARE CENTER EVERY WEEKEND. IF YOU ARE LUCKY YOU WILL GET A GOOD ONE. OTHERWISE, VISING NOKIA CARE CENTER WOULD BE YOUR WEEKEND ROUTINE....:)
      
      
      THE COMMON DRAWBACKS OF THIS PHONE ARE:
      
      1. PHOTOS TAKEN AT LOW LIGHT ARE NOT SO GOOD. IF FLASH IS USED, THE PICTURES BECOME WHITISH.
      
      2. THE PHONE HAS GOT DOLBY SOUND SYSTEM. BUT THE EAR PHONES NOKIA HAS GIVEN ARE CHEAP QUALITY ONES. WHAT IS THE POINT OF PROVIDING DOLBY SOUND SYSTEM WITH A BELOW AVERAGE EARPHONES? YOU HAVE TO SPEND AGAIN ON GOOD EAR PHONES."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"IT HAS SOME GOOD FEATURES, BUT FORGOTTEN BASIC FEATURES LIKE THERE IS NO FM, NO FILE MANAGER, NO TASK MANAGER, WHEN A MEDIA VOLUME IS INCREASED IT AUTOMATICALLY ASSINGED RING VOLUME. THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN MANY MORE BASIC FEATURES. I HAVE SOLD OUT AFTER ONE MONTH"
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"LET ME ASSURE YOU, I ENJOYED THE WINDOWS EXPERIENCE.. EVERYTHING FROM THE TOUCH TO THE PROCESSING SPEED TO THE MUSIC QUALITY, SCREEN, PHOTO QUALITY.
      
      
      NOW CONSIDER THIS... WHAT GOOD IS A PHONE IF ITS BATTERY LASTS JUST 1/2 A DAY ??
      
      
      THAT TOO WITHOUT PLAYING ANY GAMES OR VIDEOS, JUST WHTSAPP AND TWITTER.
      
      
      IT HAS DISAPPOINTED ME TO THE MAGNITUDE THAT I CAN NEVER CONSIDER GOING BACK TO WINDOWS EVER AGAIN"
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"MY REVIEW WAS DELETED FROM FLIPKART BECAUSE SOMEONE COPY/PASTED MY REVIEW ON ANOTHER POPULAR MOBILE SITE... SO HERE IS MY REVIEW AGAIN AND I HAVE EDITED A BIT.
      
      
      I , LIKE ANY OTHER INDIAN WAITING 3 LONG MONTHS FOR THIS MOBILE AND WAS IT WORTH IT??? LETS FIND OUT....
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. DECENT CAMERA
      
      2. SUPER SMOOTH AND SENSITIVE TOUCH COMPARABLE TO ANY OTHER HIGH END PHONE IN THE MARKET.
      
      3. GOOD RESOLUTION.
      
      4. AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDING IS REALLY GOOD, TOP CLASS.
      
      
      CONS: ITS A LONG LIST AND MOST OF THE CONS ARE WP8 CENTRIC...SO HERE WE GO AND I WILL BE VERY HONEST..!
      
      1. MULI TASKING IS A COMPLETE JOKE ON THIS PHONE. ALL THE APPS ARE SUSPENDED IN THE BACKGROUND I.E THEY ARE NOT WORKING BUT JUST WAITING . SO IF YOU ARE DOWNLOADING A FILE AND WANT TO READ A PDF DOC SIMULTANEOUSLY... DONT EXPECT THIS PHONE TO KEEP DOWNLOADING THE FILE IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE YOU READ HAPPILY!! HOW ANNOYING IS DAT??
      
      
      2. INSTALLING APPS IS A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS... YOU HAVE TO LOG IN TO YOUR HOTMAIL ID TO INSTALL APPS.. DAT IS FINE BUT EVEN IF YOU HAV SAVED THE XPS (INSTALLATION FILE) ON YOUR MICRO SD CARD.. YOU NEED TO CONNECT TO YOUR WINDOWS LIVE ACCOUNT TO INSTALL IT..!! SO BASICALLY YOU CANNOT INSTALL AN APP OR GAME OFFLINE EVER!
      
      
      3. IE 10 CANNOT DOWNLOAD AN MP3 FILE ...IT CAN ONLY STREAM IT!!! SO THERE IS NO WAY FOR YOU TO DOWNLOAD ANY MP3 FROM YOUR FAVOURITE MUSIC SITE...LEGAL OR ILLEGAL..! IT CANNOT EVEN SAVE A MP3 IF IT HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO A MAIL IN YOUR INBOX!! YOU CANT DOWNLOAD ANY OTHER FILE FORMAT LIKE AVI, UTUBE VDOS , RAR, ETC ""WOW""""
      
      ( DOWNLOAD A BROWSER CALLED UC BROWSER, IT ALLOWS US TO DOWNLOAD MP3 FILES AND SAVE THEM IN THE MUSIC FOLDER )
      
      
      4. YOU CANNOT RENAME YOUR PICS, YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD
      
      ""PICTURE INFO"" FROM THE STORE TO VIEW FILE DETAILS LIKE SIZE, RESOLUTION, ETC
      
      5. CANNOT SEND VIDEO FILE BY BLUETOOTH...
      
      7. WHATSAPP IS THERE AND INSTALLED BUT ITS STILL A REDUCED VERSION OF THE ANDROID ... THERE ARE NO SMILEYS!!
      
      
      8. NOKIA MUSIC ALLOWS YOU TO DOWNLOAD LATEST BOLLYWOOD SONGS FOR FREE(LEGAL) WOOOWWWW.... BUT THAT IS A HALF TRUTH.... THE SONGS WHICH ARE DOWNLOADED ARE COMPRESSED (A 5-6 MB SONG IS COMPRESSED TO 1.5 MB) AND SO THE QUALITY SUCKS..!!
      
      
      9. THERE IS NO SIGN OF A FILE MANAGER. SO BASICALLY YOU CANNOT VIEW OR KNOW WHERE ALL YOUR FILES ARE ON THE PHONE. SO IF YOU RECIEVE A FILE VIA BLUETOOTH FROM A FRIEND WHICH IS NOT A MP3 OR A VIDEO.... THOSE FILES GET TOTALLY LOST IN SUM MYSTERIOUS PLACE ON YOUR PHONE! THEY EAT UP SPACE AND U CANT EVEN SEARCH FOR THEM AND DELETE THEM.!
      
      
      10. YOU CANNOT EDIT ANY IMAGE ON YOUR PHONE.. THERE ARE APPS AVAILABLE THAT CAN EDIT BUT U NEED TO STAY CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET, UPLOAD YOUR PICS, EDIT THEM ONLINE AND THEN DOWNLOAD THEM AGAIN..!! (WHO HAS THE TIME FOR SUCH NONSENSE??)
      
      
      11. BATTERY LIFE IS BELOW PAR, AS OF NOW IT GIVES ME A BACKUP FOR ONLY A LITTLE MORE THAN 4 HOURS IF I AM ALWAYS CONNECTED THRU INTERNET . AND THIS FIGURE DOES NOT INCLUDE GAMING, PHONE CALLS, ETC..
      
      
      THESE ARE SOME OF THE BUGS THAT I CAN REMEMBER ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD..!! I HAVENT YET EVEN TESTED THE VERY FAMOUS MULTI TOUCH ISSUE..!! DONT GET ME WRONG... I REALLY WANT TO LIKE WP8 BUT BELIEVE ME MICROSOFT HAVE SCREWED UP BIG TIME.! I AM NOT EVEN BLAMING NOKIA FOR THE MESS!!
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS DUMB.. EVEN MY OLD 6600 SYMBIAN PHONE DAT I BOUGHT WAY BACK IN 2006 WAS WAY SMARTER THAN THIS MOBILE. YES IT DID NOT HAVE STEREO SOUND, BIG FAT RAM, 5 MP CAM OR A GIANT PROCESSOR.... BUT IT WAS SMART. IT WS INTUITIVE AND DID NOT FORCE ME TO DO THINGS A CERTAIN WAY..!! IT NEVER FORCED ME TO STAY CONNECTED TO INSTALL A SIMPLE APP ON MY PHONE!!
      
      IT HAD APPS THAT ALLOWED ME TO CREATE PLAYLISTS ON MY PHONE ITSELF...(REMEMBER POWERMP3 ??)  THE POINT IS.. IF YOU ARE SPENDING 15K ON A PHONE... IT SHOULD BE WORTH IT!! I CANNOT FORCE ANYBODY TO NOT BUY THIS PHONE BUT ATLEAST I CAN WARN PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE GETTING INTO. THE REVIEW MIGHT SOUND HARSH BUT THOSE THINGS HAVE ANNOYED ME.!!
      
      THANK YOU :)"
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"PHONE IS VERY GOOD , BUT WINDOW OS NOT AS PAR . MAY BE WINDOW HAS THEIR OWN FUTURE PLAN , THEY WILL BUILD THEIR OWN WINDOW MICROSOFT PHONE PLATEFORM IN FUTURE

      HARDWARE
      
      ======
      
      AMAZING PHONE AS FAR AS HARDWARE IS CONCERN, AND WHY NOT ITS NOKIA.
      
      
      1. CAMERA AMAZING.
      
      2. MUSIC AMAZING, I HAVE USED APPLE EAR PIECE AND ENABLED DOLBY; IT IS SO COOL.
      
      3. LOOK WISE VERY GOOD.
      
      
      SOFTWARE/WINDOW PHONE 8 OS
      
      ===================
      
      ITS A GOOD OS BUT MICROSOFT SHIT THEMSELF, BY NEGLECTING VERY BASIC APPLICATION NEED OF A MOBILE USERS
      
      
      1. MUSIC: YOU CANNOT CREATE PLAYLIST... SHIT ARE YOU SERIOUS, -- YES I AM.
      
      2. NO FILE EXPLORER, I HAVE TRANSFERRED FEW ""PDF"" FILES USING BLUETOOTH, AND STILL SEARCHING WHERE THEY ARE GONE.
      
      3. MICROSOFT PDF READER APP IS UNABLE TO READ PDF, STILL NOT ABLE TO FIND A SIMPLE PDF OR BOOK READER THAT CAN FIND PDF FROM MY PHONE MEMORY OR FROM SD CARD, ALSO THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FIND MY PDFS TRANSFERRED USING BLUETOOTH.
      
      4. IT NOTHING COMPARE TO ANDROID.
      
      
      FINALLY -- NOKIA 5 STAR, MICROSOFT 0, WAITING FOR NOKIA TO LEAVE WINDOWS AND COME UP WITH ANDROID OR UBUNTU MOBILE OS."
Nokia Lumia 620,2,"THIS PHONE HAS EXCELLENT FEATURES LIKE SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS, CLARITY, GOOD CAMERA. IN FACT IT IS BETTER THAN MOST ANDROID PHONES. HOWEVER, WHAT GOOD IS A PHONE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHARGED EVERY 8 HRS! ITS FRUSTRATING."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"1) WHEN I PURCHASED IT FIRST TIME I CAME UP SPEAKER ISSUE (FAULTY HARDWARE), THANKS TO FLIPKART THEY HAVE ARRANGED THE REPLACEMENT.
      
      
      2) NOW AFTER RECEIVING THE REPLACEMENT FIRST ISSUE IS OF NOKIA MUSIC (UNLIMITED DOWNLOAD) WHICH NOW SHOWS ACTIVATION ERROR, AFTER SEVERAL COMPLAINTS, NOKIA CUSTOMER CARE IS STILL WORKING ON SAME (MORE THAN A WEEK)
      
      
      3) PHONE HANGS WHENEVER I USE BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY.
      
      
      4) NOW I M FEELING SAD TO COMPLAIN TO FLIPKART REGARDING THE SAME ISSUE. (BECAUSE THERE IS NO FAULT OF WEB SELLER) ITS A MANUFACTURING FAULT WHICH COMPANY NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OR AFTER SALES DEPARTMENT."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"1)WINDOWS PHONE DOSENT HAV A FILE MANAGER
      
      2)U NEVER RECIEVE NOTIFICATIONS PROPERLY
      
      3)CANT SEND PICS THROUGHT FACEBOOK APP ,IT DOSENT HAVE F.B MESSANGER APP -.-
      
      4)THE APP STORE COMPLETLY SUCKS
      
      U CANT DOWNLOAD VIDEO COZ IT IDK WHERE IT IS SAVED IN MEMORY CARD
      
      5) THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK IS ITS MAX SCREEN TIME OUT IS ONLY FOR 5 MINUTES AND WHEN U LOCK THE SCREEN THE DOWNLOADS GETS STOPPED I.E YOU CANT KEEP THE DOWNLOADS GOING YOU NEED TO AGAIN AND AGAIN TAP THE SCREEN
      
      6)THERE ARE ALSO SERIOUS NETWORK ISSUES IN THIS PHONE U NEED TO CUT THE SIM CARD TO INSERT IT -.-
      
      DONT GET FOOLED MY ITS SPECIFICATIONS THIS PHONE COMPLETLY SUCKS INFACT ALL WINDOWS PHONES SUCKS !!! I WASTED MY MONEY AND BROUGHT THIS AND AFTER ONE WEEK I SOLD THAT OUT"
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"AS MUCH GREAT OS AND HARDWARE IMPROVEMENTS WERE MADE TO THE NOKIA PHONE RECENTLY,
      
      THE NOKIA AFTER-SALES SERVICE SEEMS AS BAD AS IT WAS EARLIER.
      
      
      VOICEING OUT MY EXPERINCE SINCE MANY MAY EXPERINCE THE SAME SOON.
      
      
      THEY 'WILL' COAX YOU INTO GETTING AN EXTENDED WARRANTY!
      
      .ALTHOUGH IT MAY SEEM A GOOD IDEA TO GET  THE EXTENDED WARRANTY,
      
      NEVER OPT FOR IT  UNTILL YOU ARE VERY SURE OR UNTIL THE WARRANTY EXPIRES.
      
      
      THE SERVICE  GUYS ARE INCOMPETENT TO WORK WITH THE LATEST OS OR HARDWARE.

Nokia Lumia 620,1,"CAMERA IS GOOD..BUT APPS ARE NOT AVAILABLE..NOKIA LUMIA 620 IS INCOMPLETE SMARTPHONE BY ITS FEATURES AND SPECS. I M USING FRM 15 DAYS. MY FRNDS R LAUGHING ON ME TO BUY IT........

AHAAAKEYBOARD SUGETIONS NOT FOR EVERYWHERE.I BOUGHT A NOKIA LUMIA 620 FEW DAYS BACK AND IT HANGED"
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"DONT GO FOR THIS PHONE. IT HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS.
      
      FIRST, HAVE TO CUT MY SIM FOR THIS SH*T. THEN AFTER MERE 2 MONTHS MICROPHONE WENT BAD. IT WILL WORK FOR 2 HRS. AND THEN WILL SUDDENLY STOP WORKING... I COULDN'T CALL SOMEONE OR RECEIVE ANY CALLS...
      
      MOREOVER WENT TO NOKIA CARE EVERY WEEK FOR A MONTH BUT THEY COULDN'T IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM. GAVE MY MOBILE FOR 9 DAYS TO NOKIA CARE STILL PROBLEM PERSISTS...
      
      
      IT'S A RETARDED PHONE. THE ONLY RESPONSE I AM GETTING NOW IS THAT I DONT HAVE MICRO SIM AND BECAUSE OF THAT I AM HAVING PROBLEM BUT THIS THEORY IS ALSO NOT TRUE AS I HAVE USED MY SIM ON FRIEND'S MOBILE AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY FINE... NOW I CANT USE MY SIM TOO AS IT IS CUT TO FIT THESE SH*TTY PHONE....
      
      
      WORST IS THAT, WENT TO NOKIA CARE AND FOUND FRIEND THERE WHO HAS LUMIA 720 WITH CAMERA NOT WORKING... FOR HIM ALSO NOKIA CARE COULDN'T IDENTIFY PROBLEM.
      
      
      SO REQUESTING TO STICK WITH ANDROID BASED PHONES.... DONT BUY ANY LUMIA AT LEAST... AS NOKIA CARE IS ALWAYS FULL WITH LUMIA PHONES (SEEN EVERYTIME I VISITED THE SHOP).....
      
      
      WINDOWS HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS AND NOKIA HAS LONG LEFT MANUFACTURING QUALITY PRODUCT.... TOTALLY LET DOWN BY NOKIA AND WINDOWS."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"HI ALL,
      
      LET ME TELL ONE THING CLEARLY. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT BCOZ OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS GIVEN IN FP. MOST OF THEM WHO GAVE + REVIEW HAVE USED THE MOBILE ONLY FOR FEW DAYS.I ALSO THOUGHT TO WRITE A POSITIVE REVIEW INITIALLY BUT WAITED TO PUT A VALID REVIEW AFTER USING THE MOBILE FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
      
      YOU WILL FEEL HAPPY ONLY FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS. THE TOUCH WILL ATTRACT U INITIALLY.THERE WILL NOT BE ANY LAG OR HANGS.
      
      AFTER USING THE MOBILE FOR AROUND 2 MONTHS LET ME GIVE MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE PHONE.
      
      *THE PHONE LAGS AND HANGS A LOT. SOMETIMES IT RESTARTS BY ITSELF WITHOUT REASON. WHEN THE PHONE HANGS YOU CANT RESTART IT THROUGH BUTTONS. THERE IS NO REACTION FROM THE PHONE WHEN U GIVE LONG PRESS FOR THE POWER BUTTON. THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD RECOVER FROM THE HANG IS TO REMOVE THE BATTERY AND PUT IT AGAIN.THE PHONE WILL HANG WHEN THE NET IS ON AND YOU PLAY GAMES. EVEN LAGS WILL BE THERE WHEN TEXTING SMS. THESE PROBLEMS NOT FOUND INITIALLY.
      
      * THERE IS NO CONTROL OF VOLUME THROUGH S/W. YOU CAN MANAGE ONLY THROUGH VOLUME UP AND DOWN BUTTON. NOW MY VOLUME UP BUTTON GONE &AMP; I AM NOT ABLE TO INCREASE THE VOLUME.(NOKIA CARE IS ASKING RS.850 TO REPAIR THIS SAYING THAT PHYSICAL DAMAGES NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY).
      
      * WORST BATTERY BACKUP. AM CHARGING MY MOBILE TWICE A DAY. NO LONG CALLS. I USED TO SWITCH ON THE INTERNET WHENEVER NEEDED AND SWITCH IT OFF WHEN NOT IN USE. ALL OTHER STUFFS LIKE BLUETOOTH, WI-FI ETC WILL ALWAYS BE OFF. I HAVE ALSO BLOCKED ALL APPS THAT COULD RUN IN THE BACKGROUND. I HAVE ALSO SET TO SYNCHRONIZE THE MAILS MANUALLY. I PLAY GAMES A LITTLE. SO THE BATTERY SHOULD COME AT LEAST FOR 1DAY BUT BATTERY BACKUP COMES HARDLY FOR 12HOURS.THE MOBILE HAS TO BE PLUGGED IN ALWAYS TO USE IT CONTINUOUSLY.
      
      * THE SCREEN BACK BUTTON IS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. WHEN I PRESS IT, THE SCREEN GOES INSIDE. THESE PROBLEMS WERE NOT THERE INITIALLY.I HAVE TO SWITCH OFF THE SCREEN AND ON IT TO RECOVER.
      
      *THE PHONE GOT RESTARTED WHEN I DROPPED IT OVER A PILLOW WHICH MEANS THAT THE HARDWARE IS NOT STURDY.
      
      * LACK OF FILE MANAGER.AM NOT ABLE TO LOCATE THE PHOTOS SENT BY MY FRIEND THROUGH BLUETOOTH. THIS IS HOW SOFTWARE MANAGES FOR THE FILES US.
      
      * IN ALL THE APPLICATIONS, SELECT OPTION IS GIVEN BUT NOWHERE SELECT ALL OPTION IS GIVEN. WHEN I WANT TO SELECT ALL THE FILES TO DELETE I CANT DO IN SINGLE SHOT.
      
      * WHILE LISTENING TO SONGS, 'ADD TO NOW PLAYING' OPTION HAS BEEN GIVEN BUT WHEN I SELECT SONGS AND GIVE ADD TO NOW PLAYING THEN IT IS NOT GETTING ADDED TO THE PLAYLIST NOR THE SELECTED SONG IS PLAYED.
      
      * MUTE OPTION IS NOT GIVEN EITHER IN THE MUSIC PLAYER OR IN VIDEO PLAYER.
      
      * MAKING CALLS IS NOT USER FRIENDLY. YOU NEED TO HAVE ""RAPDIALER"" APP TO MAKE CALLS EASILY. CALL DURATION IS ALSO NOT PROVIDED WITH THE CALLER IN THE MOBILE.
      
      * IE IS OK BUT NOT THE BEST. POP-UP BLOCKER HAS BEEN ENABLED AND NO CONTROL IS GIVEN TO DISABLE IT. NO FORWARD BUTTON.SCREEN BACK BUTTON WORKS AS BACK BUTTON FOR IE. TABBED BROWSING IS NOT PROPER. IF YOU WANT TO OPEN ANOTHER WINDOW, YOU NEED TO MINIMIZE THE CURRENT WINDOW AND OPEN A NEW ONE. WHEN U GO BACK TO THE FIRST WINDOW THE PAGE REFRESHES AGAIN. WEBSITES WITH FLASH CONTENT IS NOT LOADING PROPERLY. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD FILES THROUGH IE. EVEN UC BROWSER IS NOT GOOD. NOT ABLE EXPORT FILES DOWNLOADED THROUGH UC.
      
      * THERE IS NO INBUILT PDF READER. YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT FROM THE STORE WHICH IS FREE.
      
      * GOOD APPS AND GAMES ARE PAID.YOU NEED WI-FI TO DOWNLOAD SOME GOOD APPS/GAMES.
      
      * THE PHONE HEATS UP LIKE ANYTHING WHEN PLAYING GAMES OR USING NET.
      
      *  HEADSET IS OF AVERAGE QUALITY.
      
      * IF YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH A LIST YOU HAVE TO SCROLL A LOT. OFCOURSE SEARCH OPTION IS GIVEN. ONE PAIN POINT I EXPERIENCED IS THAT WHEN BROWSING I WANTED TO SELECT A VALUE FROM A BIG DROP DOWN LIST WHICH HAD SOME HUNDREDS OF VALUE,I HAD TO SCROLL FOR SOME MINUTES. BUT IN ANDROID YOU CAN HOLD UR FINGER AND GO THROUGH A LIST EASILY.
      
      * YOU NEED ""RINGTONE MAKER"" TO SET A CUSTOM RINGTONE FOR YOUR PHONE. OTHERWISE IT IS NOT EASY TO SET.
      
      * TOUCH WAS BUTTER SMOOTH ONLY FOR FEW DAYS.
      
      * INBUILT GAMES PROVIDED ARE OF WASTE.
      
      * AS IN ANDROID, YOU CANNOT SWIPE AND OPEN BLUETOOTH, WI-FI, MUSIC PLAYER ETC FROM THE TOP OF THE MAIN SCREEN WHEN IT IS RUNNING.
      
      * ON SCREEN PATTERN LOCKING MECHANISM IS NOT PROVIDED(SECURITY FEATURE).
      
      * EVEN THOUGH FRONT CAMERA IS THERE, VIDEO CALL OPTION IS NOT PROVIDED. I THINK WE NEED TO DEPEND ON SKYPE FOR THIS. NOT YET TRIED IT.
      
      * CAMERA, MAP AND SCREEN QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      STILL MANY BASIC FEATURES ARE MISSING WHICH I MIGHT HAVE FORGOT WHILE WRITING THIS REVIEW.
      
      THE ONLY THING I FIND MORE USEFUL ABOUT THE PHONE IS THE OUTLOOK.I USED TO CHECK OFFICE MAILS WHICH AM FINDING IT EASY.
      
      INITIALLY I HAD MANY POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS PHONE WHICH ALL TURNED INTO NEGATIVE AFTER USAGE OF 2MONTHS.
      
      THIS MOBILE IS NOT WORTH FOR 14K.I FEEL WORRIED THAT I HAD SPEND THIS MUCH MONEY ON THIS FAILURE MODEL.THE MOBILE IS WORTH ONLY FOR 8K.
      
      I WONT RECOMMEND THIS MODEL FOR ANYONE. MAY BE GO FOR LUMIA 520 WHICH YOU COULD GET IT FOR 9K."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"HI ALL,

      2:- GREAT TOUCH AND CLARITY
      
      3:- EASY FOR OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS WITH OFFICE 2013"
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"HI GUYS,
      
      
      THE IMEI NUMBER OF MY NOKIA LUMIA IS 354636059043482.NOW IT'S UP TO THE PEOPLE WHETHER THEY BELIEVE THAT I HAVE A NOKIA LUMIA OR NOT.:) SINCE SO CALLED MR.ANKUR BELIEVES THAT I DON'T HAVE A NOKIA LUMIA.JUST NOW I CAME FROM NOKIA CARE CENTER AND THEY HAVE AGREED TO CHANGE THE SOFTWARE. PHONE IS LAUNCHED IN INDIA IN MARCH SO NOT MANY PEOPLE HAS GOT ANY HANDS ON ON IT.
      
      
      THESE ARE THE FLAWS OF NOKIA LUMIA :
      
      
      1)IT DOESN'T HAVE WIFI HOTSPOT ,EVEN 6000 RS GALAXY Y HAS WIFI HOTSPOT SUPPORT.
      
      3)CANNOT TRANSFER VIDEO VIA BLUETOOTH.
      
      4)NO FILE MANAGER.
      
      5)SD CARD HOLDER IS VERY POOR WHILE MOST OF THE PHONE HAS THE SLOT FOR SD CARD OUTSIDE NOW.
      
      6)BATTERY BACKUP IS TOO POOR.CAN'T EXPECT THIS FROM NOKIA.
      
      7)NOKIA MAP DOES NOT MATCH WITH GOOGLE MAP AND MOREOVER YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD 700MB OF MAP.
      
      8)SOUND QUALITY IF YOU HEAR VIA SPEAKER IS TOO POOR.
      
      9)THE HEADPHONE PROVIDED BY NOKIA WITH THIS HANDSET IS USELESS.
      
      10)WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING ANY VIDEO IF YOU LOCK THE THE SCREEN VIDEO STOPS ..FUNNY ISN.T IT....LOOKS LIKE NOKIA HAS NOT DONE PROPER TESTING BEFORE LAUNCHING THIS IN THE MARKET.
      
      
      OTHERS ,,THOSE WHO ARE BUYING NOKIA LUMIA CAN FIND IT OUT.ALL THE BEST :)"
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"HI,
      
      NOKIA PHONES LAG BEHIND ANDROID PHONES AND LUMIA IS ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE FOR THAT.
      
      HERE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS I AM FACING
      
      1. THE PHONE HANGS SUDDENLY AND EVEN POWER BUTTON DOESNT WORK THAT TIME. U NEED TO REMOVE AND KEEP THE BATTERY AGAIN TO RESTART.
      
      2. NO PROPER FILE MANAGER. IT IS REALLY A BIG PROBLEM AS U CANT FIND WHERE THE FILES TRANSFERRED THROUGH BLUETOOTH ARE GOING.
      
      3. NO PROPER PDF READER. ANDROID IS GIVING ACROBAT READER AND WINDOWS PHONES ARE GIVING A READER WHICH CANT EVEN DETECT THE FILES FROM SD CARD.
      
      4. NO PROPER MESSENGERS ALSO. THERE IS NO PROPER GOOGLE CHAT, FACEBOOK CHAT OR YAHOO MESSENGER APPLICATIONS TO CHAT WITH YOUR FRIENDS. ALL THE APPS AVAILABLE NOW ARE VERY SLOW AND HALF THE TIME THEY HAVE PROBLEM WITH CONNECTING TO INTERNET.
      
      5. EVEN THE CAMERA. EVEN TOUGH ITS PROVIDING LED  FLASH, PHOTO CLARITY IS NOT SO GREAT.
      
      6. PERSONALIZATION. YOU CANT HAVE A WALL PAPER AND THERE IS ONLY SCOPE FOR THE BORING WHITE AND BLACK BACKGROUND.
      
      BORING PHONE AND NOT SO GREAT PROS TO DISCUSS. XPERIA, GALAXY AND DESIRE OF HTC ARE BETTER OPTIONS FOR SURE."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I AM USING NOKIA LUMIA 620 AND I FOUND THESE MANY FAULTS IN THIS OS:-
      
      1. ITS NOT PROPERLY ORGANISED I.E. VIDEOS ARE NOT SAVED IN VIDEOS FOLDER NOR WE CAN MOVE ANY VIDEOS FILE OR ANY OTHER FILE FROM ONE LOCATION TO OTHER(FOLDER).
      
      2. THERE ARE VERY FEW APPS FOR WINDOWS PHONE AS COMPARE TO ANDROID PHONE.
      
      3. WE CAN'T SEND VIDEOS FILE USING WATAPPS, HIKE ETC. NOR WE CAN USE VIBER FOR FREE CALLING
      
      4. YOU CAN'T ABLE TO SEE FILES(LIKE SOFTWARE) WHICH IS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM ONE PHONE TO WINDOWS PHONE.
      
      5. HEADPHONE QUALITY IS BAD I.E. YOU CAN'T HEAR THE SONGS WHILE TRAVELLING.
      
      
      ONLY ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT WINDOWS PHONE IS GUI . IT'S APPEAR ATTRACTIVE TO USE.
      
      
      AT-LAST I WANT TO CONCLUDE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SMARTPHONE I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO GO WITH ANY OTHER PHONE OTHER THAN WINDOWS PHONE COZ WE ARE USING SMARTPHONE FOR PLAYING GOOD GAMES , MORE APPS, LISTENING MUSIC ETC. THIS ALL FEATURES ARE NOT PRESENT IN WINDOWS PHONE. SO PLEASE DON'T BUY IT ."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I BOUGHT MY NOKIA LUMIA 620 FROM FLIPKART. AFTER EXTREMELY LONG DELAY, WHEN I RECEIVED IT, I FOUND THAT IT WAS A DEFECTIVE PIECE WITH BLACK PATCH ON THE DISPLAY. I FILED THE COMPLAINT WITH FLIPKART NEARLY 4 DAYS BACK..STILL THERE IS NO RESPONSE FROM FLIPKART...VERY UNFORTUNATE TO SAY THAT THIS IS EXTREMELY UNFAIR AND UNPROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM FLIPKART...I AM A LONG STANDING CUSTOMER OF FLIPKART AND I DONT THINK I DESERVE THIS KIND OF TREATMENT....I FEAR THAT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS FALLING AT AN ALARMING PACE WITH FLIPKART....REQUEST TO SOLVE MY COMPLAINT AT THE EARLIEST...."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ABOUT 1.5 MONTHS AGO, I HAVE ALREADY SOLD IT, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PHONE, IT HANGS AT TIMES, SOMETIMES WHEN YOU ARE PICKING UP A CALL, THERE IS NO ANSWER ICON ON THE SCREEN TO ANSWER THE CALL! THERE WAS A LOUDSPEAKER PROBLEM AND A EARPIECE PROBLEM WITH ME NOT EVEN USING THIS PHONE FOR A MONTH!
      
      
      AND THE BATTERY OF THIS PHONE IS VERY VERY POOR, I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM A AUTHORIZED NOKIA SHOWROOM IN A MALL! I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HUGELY DISAPPOINTED WITH A PHONE IN MY LIFE, THE ONLY GOOD THING I POSSIBLY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS PHONE IS NOKIA DRIVE, IT HAS POSSIBLY THE BEST NAVIGATION SYSTEM I HAVE SEEN IN A PHONE, YOU CAN EVEN DOWNLOAD THE MAPS OF THE WHOLE OF INDIA IN A 600MB DOWNLOAD SO THAT YOU DON'T NEED ANY 3G CONNECTION TO RUN THE NAVIGATION, IT'S WAY BETTER THAN GOOGLE MAPS, TRUST ME ON THAT ONE.
      
      
      SO FOR THAT, I SUGGEST INSTEAD OF INVESTING MONEY ON A GPS FOR A CAR, GO AHEAD AND GET A NOKIA LUMIA 520, THAT ALSO HAS THE SAME NAVIGATION SYSTEM. SO BASICALLY THIS PHONE IS JUST A GPS AND A FAIRLY OK BROWSER. EVERYTHING ELSE SUCKS ABOUT THIS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE SO THAT I CAN EXPERIENCE WINDOWS 8 . ITS GOOD. THE PHONE HOWEVER IS A DISAPPOINTMENT AS THE PHONE FREEZES WHEN PICKING CALLS. I HAVE BEEN USING THE PHONE FOR PAST 2 DAYS AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE INSTANCES WHERE I WAS UNABLE TO PICK CALLS - THE TOUCH SCREEN DOESNT RESPOND :) . YOU CAN GOOGLE THE SAME 'NOKIA LUMIA FREEZING' FOR MORE USER EXPERIENCES. THE PHONE IS NOT A PHONE UNLESS YOU CAN PICK CALLS, PLEASE DO YOUR BIT OF RND BEFORE BUYING."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I HAVE BEEN USING TOUCH SCREEN FOR LAST 7 YEARS &AMP; FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SCREEN BROKE OF LUMIA 620. THE SERVICE CENTER IN NOIDA SEC. 2 WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE TOUCH SCREEN AND HAD NO ANSWER AS TO WHEN PART WILL BE AVAILABLE. THEY ARE EVEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE A STAND-BY. THE CENTER MANAGER IS UNAVAILABLE &AMP; DOES NOT BOTHER TO REVERT CALLS. NOIKA CUSTOMER CARE JUSTIFIES ALL THE ACTION I.E UNAVAILABILITY OF PARTS, STAND-BY &AMP; MANAGER. NO DOUBT THE BRAND HAS TAKEN A HUGE BEATING &AMP; WILL PERHAPS NOT BE ABLE TO REVIVE THE SAME."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I JUS BOUGHT MY NEW NOKIA LUMIA 620 COUPLE OF DAYS BACK AND ITS SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT.. I'M FACING CONSTANT PROBLEM WITH THE INTERNET N NOT ABLE TO DOWNLOAD ANY APP.. THE CAMERA QUALITY IS JUS MEDIOCRE, THERE IS NO OPTION OF CONNECTING A HANDSFREE, I CANT CONNECT THE PHONE TO MY CAR'S AUX WIRE N MAKE CALLS SINCE AS PER NOKIA CENTRE ITS IS ""ONLY FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC"" I'VE BEEN A NOKIA USER FOR LAST 10 YEARS AND I HAD HUGE EXPECTATIONS WITH THE NEW PHONE BUT SADLY LUMIA HAS ONLY BEEN A SOURCE OF DISAPPOINTMENT &AMP; IRRITATION SINCE I'VE PURCHASED IT.. I'M STUCK WITH THIS PHONE SINCE I'VE SPENT A BOMB ON IT BUT WOUDNT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I JUST BOUGHT LUMIA 620 MODEL MOBILE ON LAST MONTH 19TH IN THE MOBILE STORE, ELEPHANT BHAVAN, AMEERPET, HYDERABAD. THE NEXT DAY I WENT MY HOMETOWN VISAKHAPATNAM, WHEN I REACH MY HOME, MY PHONE INBUILT SPEAKER IS NOT WORKING, ONLY WORKING SPEAKER PHONE.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE MOBILE SHOP.  HE SAID ""ITS A MINOR PROBLEM, SWITCH OFF AND SWITCH ON THE PHOHE THEN THE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVE"" BUT IT COULDN'T THEN AGAIN I CALLED UP THE SHOP
      
      HE SAID NOTHING TO WORRY, WHEN U COME HYDERABAD COME TO SHOP, I WILL FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT
      
      NOTHING HAPPEN, I MET NOKIA CARE PEOPLE, THEY TOLD ME THIS IS NEW VERSION  WE DONT HAVE SPEAKERS, IT TAKES 10 DAYS TO COME, TO BE HONEST I FELT VERY BAD, BECAUSE ITS BRAND NEW, AND THE BASIC SPECIFICATIONS FAILED.  I RECOMMEND TO EVERYBODY, PLEASE DONT BUY THESE MODELS."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I NEVER FELT SO CHEATED EARLIER. I ORDERED MY PRODUCT ON 20THMAY FOR LIME GREEN AT RS13500 AND THEN ON 28THMAY I RECEIVED CALL FROM FLIPKART THAT THIS LIME GREEN COLOR IS NOT AVAILABLE AND THEY ASKED ME CANCEL THIS ORDER. NOW JUST AFTER 1 DAY THIS THING IS AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEBSITE BUT NOW THEY WONT HONOUR THERE EARLIER COMMITMENT.
      
      THIS IS REALLY A GRAVE MISMANAGEMENT AT FLIPKART WHERE THEY TAKE MORE THAN 8 DAYS TO KNOW THAT PARTICULAR ITEM IS NOT AVAILABLE BUT AFTER 1 DAY THE ITEM IS AGAIN AVAILABLE BUT AT A HIGHER PRICE."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I OWN A LUMIA 620 AND I ALSO KNOW THE EXPERIENCE OF WINDOW 8 ON 620,720,520,920 AND 820 IS MORE OR LIKE SAME..JUST EXCEPTIONS OF 1GB RAM COMPATIBLE GAMES...I LIKE TO VIEW VIDEOS IN MY PHONE VERY MUCH AND MY HOPES WERE SHATTERED WHEN I CAME TO KNOW THIS DEVICE CANNOT PLAY MKV FORMAT..I.E JUST PATHETIC ON THE PART OF MICROSOFT AND NOKIA...AS ALL THE  90% OF VIDEOS ARE IN MKV FORMAT TODAY..
      
      
      PLEASE TELL ME IF THERE IS ANY WAY TO   PLAY ALL KIND OF VIDEOS (MKV, FLV, AVI ETC)
      
      I THINK THAT ANDROID IS THE TRULY KING OF SMARTPHONES OS..AS WE HAVE MX PLAYER TO RUN ALL TYPES OF VIDEOS..THIS IS A REALLY REALLY DISAPPOINTMENT.
      
      I DONT WANNA GET INTO THE CONVERTING SHIT."
Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I OWN A LUMIA 620 THINKING THAT NEW OS WP8 WOULD BE SUPER SMART..
      
      BUT IT AIN'T GOT ANY FILE MANAGER IN IT.
      
      THE FILES RECIEVED THROUGH BLUETOOTH GOES NO WHERE..
      
      YOU CANT MANAGE IT. THE PHONE MANAGES YOU ,OFCOURSE NOT IN YOUR WAY.
      
      IT  GOT SOME HARDWARE ISSUES TOO. AFTER 2 WEEKS OF BUYING THE LOUD SPEAKER SEEMS TO BE NOT WORKING..
      
      YOU CANNOT COPY DATA FROM SD CARD TO YOUR PHONE..

Nokia Lumia 620,1,"I USED THIS  PHONE FOR A WEEK,I JUST FOUND THAT THE UI IS STUNNING.EVERYTHING ELSE LOOKS FINE.
      
      BUT THE PROBLEM IS -
      
      1)VERY LESS APPS,GAMES
      
      2)QUALITY APPS ,MISSING EVEN YOUTUBE DOWNLOADER(HAVE TO PAY 55 RS TO GET IT),
      
      3)POPULAR GAMES PRESENT ON ANDROID PLATFORM HARDLY PRESENT ON WINDOWS 8(TEMPLE RUN ,SUBWAY SURF,CUT FRUIT ETC).IF PRESENT ,YOU HAVE TO BUY IT (TEMPLE RUN 1 APPEAR ON WINDOWS A WEEK BACK FOR 55 RS,BUT TEMPLE RUN 1 &AMP; 2 ALREADY PRESENT ON ANDROID FOR FREE)
      
      4) IMPORTANT THING IS YOU CAN'T SEND VIDEO FILES TO OTHER WINDOWS AND ANDROID DEVICES.YOU CAN RECEIVE THEM ,BUT CANT SEND THEM.
      
      5) IN WHATAPP ,YOU CANT DOWNLOAD VIDEOS TO YOUR GALLERY,ALSO CANT ATTACH IT.BUT YOU CAN FORWARD IT. (WHATSAPP PROBLEM)
      
      
      CONCLUSION IS - WINDOWS 8 NEEDS SOME TIME TO STABILIZE IN TERMS OF APP AND GAME.
      
      ALSO ,WINDOWS 8.1 UPDATE IS IN PROCESS ,IT WILL RELEASE BY END OF THIS YEAR.MY ADVICE IS TO AVOID WINDOWS 8 UNTIL END OF THIS YEAR.GO FOR ANDROID JELLY BEAN 4.1.X .ENJOY APSS AND GAMES FOR FREE.IN WINDOWS 8 EVEN IF YOU GET AFTER SOMETIME ,YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR QUALITY APPS AND GAMES.
      
      IF AT ALL YOU BUY WINDOWS 8 ,MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS HIGHER SPECIFICATION ,SO THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE 8.1 UPDATE .GO FOR SONY/HTC IN ANDROID SEGMENT .THEIR BUILD QUALITY IS SUPERIOR.
      
      THEY PROMISE BETTER ANDROID UPDATE,"

IF ONLY ONE HAS THE SIGHT TO LOOK BEYOND NOKIA. BESIDES, THERE ARE STILL SOME THINGS A WINDOWS PHONE CANNOT DO. SO IF U ARE REALLY JUST LOOKING TO THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY, GO GET A NOKIA."

HAD VISITED NOKIA STORE AND CARE AND TO MY ASTONISHMENT THEY BOTH AGREED THAT NOKIA LUMIA 510 AND 610 HAS PROBLEMS AND THEY CANNOT DO NOT ANYTHING BUT TO FORMAT THE PHONE AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT 520 OR 620 WILL NOT HAVE PROBLEMS.

      I FEEL TOP COMPANIES DESIGN SUCH PHONES SO THAT THE CONSUMERS ARE ALWAYS TRAPPED AND THEIR QUESTS OF A PRACTICAL PHONE NEVER GETS FULFILLED SO THAT THE SALES NEVER STOP. OR MAY THE HIGH RANGE OF THEIR PRODUCTS NEVER MEETS COMPETITION FROM THE LOW RANGE. IT FEELS ALL THE STRATEGIES ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE MONEY NOT FULFILLING CONSUMER NEEDS!

Nokia Lumia 720,5,"AFTER BEING A NERDY CHILD AND TEENAGER, I RECENTLY DECIDED TO OPT FOR A COOL MAKEOVER OF MY PERSONALITY AND ATTITUDE. ONCE THAT WAS COMPLETE, I BEGAN THE ACCESSORIZING PHASE AND WAS LOOKING FOR A SUITABLE SMARTPHONE THAT WOULD CONVEY THE SAME VIBRANT PERSONALITY THAT I POSSESSED. ONE LOOK AT THE NEW NOKIA LUMIA 720 AND I KNEW IT WAS THE PHONE I WANTED TO HAVE. SPORTING A CHUNKY RECTANGULAR SHAPE WITH A SLIM UNIBODY DESIGN, MY LUMIA 720 CAME IN A BRIGHT RED COLOUR, ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVOURITES. FROM THE CONVENIENCE POINT OF VIEW, IT IS VERY EASY TO CHARGE MY LUMIA 720 AS IT COMES WITH WIRELESS CHARGING SHELLS THAT SPORT DIFFERENT COLOURS AND LOOK EQUALLY COOL.
      
      
      THE DISPLAY OF MY LUMIA 720 IS A LARGE 4.3-INCH IPS PANEL THAT IS VERY SENSITIVE AND RESPONDS WITH EAGERNESS TO MY TOUCH. I CAN EVEN ACCESS IT WITH MY LONG FINGERNAILS OR WHEN I AM WEARING GLOVES, SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN?T BEEN ABLE TO ON A LOT OF OTHER PHONES. WITH CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY, MY LUMIA 720 PROVIDES DEEPER CONTRASTS FOR GREAT VIEWING. I CAN EASILY PREVIEW IMAGES, WATCH MOVIES AND BROWSE THE WEB WITH CRYSTAL CLEAR CLARITY EVEN UNDER DIRECT SUNLIGHT. THE TRUECOLOUR DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY INJECTS LIFELIKE COLOURS INTO MY SCREEN.
      
      
      BEING AN AVID PHOTOGRAPHER, I ALWAYS RUE THE MOMENTS WHEN I MISS OUT ON CARRYING MY CAMERA AND SEE BEAUTIFUL VISTAS THAT CAN BE CAPTURED. THE 6.7 MP CAMERA AT THE BACK OF THE CAMERA IS A GREAT SHOOTER AND LETS ME CAPTURE BEAUTIFUL IMAGES. IT COMES WITH SMARTSHOOT THAT ALLOWS ME TO COMPOSE PERFECT GROUP SHOTS BY EDITING A SERIES OF SNAPS CLICKED OF THE SAME SUBJECT. ALSO INCLUDED IS AN ERASE FEATURE THAT HELPS ELIMINATE ANY ARTEFACTS OR UNWANTED OBJECTS IN SNAPS. THE FRONT CAMERA IS A FIRST IN TERMS OF SMARTPHONES ? IT IS A WIDE-ANGLED HD CAMERA THAT LETS ME CREATE COOL SELF PORTRAITS AND CLICK GROUP PICS WITHOUT CUTTING OUT ANY OF MY PALS. THE GLAM ME APP FOR THE FRONT CAMERA LETS ME ADD DAZZLING SPECIAL EFFECTS TO MY PORTRAIT SHOTS TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A TRUE DIVA! UPLOADING THESE SNAPS TO FACEBOOK AND OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES IS A BREEZE WITH THE DEEP SNS INTEGRATION ON MY LUMIA 720.
      
      
      ONE OF THE REASONS I OPTED FOR THE LUMIA 720 WAS ITS STATE-OF-THE-ART, CLUTTER-BREAKING WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM. IT PROVIDES SUCH A CONVENIENT AND UP-FRONT INTERFACE THAT MAKES NAVIGATION CHILD?S PLAY. ALL THAT I NEED FREQUENTLY INCLUDING MY CONTACTS, APPS, GAMES AND ANYTHING ELSE IS UP ON MY HOME SCREEN. THE HERE MAPS WITH LIVESIGHT LETS ME TRAVEL TO ANY DESTINATION I WANT WITHOUT GETTING LOST BY PROVIDING ME WITH ACCURATE DIRECTIONS. TO ENJOY SOME REALLY GOOD MUSIC, THE NOKIA MIX RADIO COMES IN HANDY AS IT LETS ME STREAM ALL MY FAVOURITE TUNES WITHOUT ANY CHARGES! THE NOKIA GIG FINDER APP IS A LITTLE GEM AS I CAN FIND OUT PLACES TO VISIT, EVENTS THAT HAPPEN, CONCERTS TO BE ORGANISED OR ANYTHING ELSE EASILY."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"AFTER ITS BRAVE ATTEMPTS TO LAUNCH SO CALLED ""SMARTPHONE"" LIKE NOKIA ASHA, NOKIA HAS FINALLY DISCOVERED AND HAS ENDED THE MYTH OF WINDOWS OS PHONE. THE BEST PHONE TO GO FOR EASY TO HANDLE AND HAS A HIGHEST BATTERY LIFE.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUSY THIS DON'T THINK MUCH AND GO FOR  NOKIA LUMNIA 720.
      
      BECAUSE YOU WORTH IT."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"AN EXCELLENT PHONE WITH EXCELLENT FEATURES... GOOD FINISH, BUTTERY SMOOTH TOUCH...JUST LOVE IT.. WINDOWS 8 IS A VERY GOOD OS AND NOKIA HAS DONE A DECENT JOB IN MAKING 720 LOOK SEXY ...:) THE ONLY CONS THAT I COULD FIND IS THE 512MB RAM. BUT THIS AMOUNT OF RAM IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO RUN THE WINDOWS 8 OS SMOOTHLY... NO LAGS, GOOD RESPONSE.. I ALSO OWN A GALAXY TAB 2.0 . TO BE FRANK, I'M GETTING FED UP WITH THE CLICHE ANDROID OS. NOW WITH THE VERSION 4.1.2  BATTERY DRAIN ISSUES.. ITS SEEMS TO BE LIKE HELL.. ALSO HEARD THAT ANDROID HAS NOT FIXED THE BATTERY DRAIN ISSUE WITH THE LATEST PATCH OF JELLY BEAN 4.2.2 . LUMIA 720 HAS AN EXCELLENT BATTERY LIFE. THANKS TO THE LIGHT WEIGHT OS. ITS GIVING  ME ALMOST A 2 DAYS BACKUP FOR MY USE, WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAVE USED ANDROID PHONES.
      
      ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS TO GO FOR IT GUYS...

      --- LUMIA 720 REVIEW --
      
      
      1.WP8 UI
      
      AWESOME METRO UI (GOOD RESPITE FROM THAT BORING IOS AND ANDROID UIS) + APPS HAVE THE SAME METRO UI
      
      CLEAN AND SIMPLISTIC APPROACH TO SORT YOUR APPS (ALPHABETICALLY INDEXED)
      
      LIVE TILES (THIS IS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE IN WP8) WHICH GIVE U LIVE FEEDS FOR ALL UR PINNED APPS
      
      
      2.DISPLAY
      
      SHARP IS THE FIRST ADJECTIVE WHICH I'LL USE :P
      
      NICE COLORS + ADAPTIVE BRIGHTNESS (DISPLAY IS GOOD EVEN WHEN U R UNDER SUN)
      
      
      3.NOKIA LUMIA TOUCH IS ITS USP - IT IS THE SMOOTHEST FONE I HAVE EVER USED AND MIND IT M COMPARING IT WITH LIKES OF I PHONE 5 AND GALAXY S3
      
      
      4. X BOX GAMES - THIS NOT A MAJOR PLUS AS MOST OF THE GOOD GAMES ARE NOT FOR FREE
      
      
      5. HERE MAPS, DRIVE, AND CITY LENS ARE THE BEST NAVIGATION APPS U WUD EVER SEE...AWESOME TRANSLATION OF AUGMENT REALITY. STILL A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT I'M SATISFIED.
      
      
      6. PEOPLE HUB - THIS INTEGRATES ALL YOUR TWITTER, FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN ACCOUNTS AND WILL GIVE U UPDATES IN A SINGLE PLACE. PEOPLE GROUPS ADD TO ITS AWESOMNESS - WHEN YOU WANT TO CHECK THE UPDATES FROM CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE, JUST ADD THEM TO A CUSTOMIZED GROUP.
      
      
      7. LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST ----- NOKIA CAMERA ----- M LUVING IT. PEOPLE WHO ARE AMATEURS INTO PHOTOGRAPHY, PROS WHO CAN'T CARRY THEIR HEAVY GEAR EVERYTIME AND DON'T WANT TO MISS ANY PHOTO OPPURTUNITY - NOKIA LUMIA IS THE GADGET U'RE LOOKING FOR. INSTALL FREE APP CAMERA 360, USE SMART SHOOT, PANAROMA AND CREATE AN AMAZING NEW WORLD (PHOTO :P).
      
      
      CONS: WINDOW MARKET IS NOT CROWDED WITH ALL THOSE APPS WHICH U FIND ON ANDROID, THERE IS A DECENT COLLECTION OF APPS AND GAMES WHICH SUFFICE MY REQUIREMENTS ATLEAST. MEANWHILE, THEY SAY WP IS CATCHING UP WITH ANDROID AND IOS IN TERMS OF APPS.

JUST GET THIS AMAZINGLY CRAFTED UNIBODY DEVICE AND FEEL THE NOKIA LUMIA MAGIK (MAGIC).."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"BORED OF THE STEREOTYPICAL ANDROID AND IOS PHONES, I MADE A MOVE TOWARDS THE WINDOWS 8 PLATFORM AVAILABLE FROM THE MOST RELIABLE OF BRANDS ? NOKIA, BY OPTING FOR THE LUMIA 720! IT IS A PERFECT MIX OF THE PROS OF LUMIA 620 AND THE 820. THOUGH I HAD TO WAIT FOR MINE AS I WAS LOW ON MY BUDGET, IT WAS WORTH IT. THE PHONE ADDS A DASH OF STYLE AND PERSONA TO ME. IT?S JUST LIKE ME?COLOURFUL AND VIBRANT!
      
      
      MY LUMIA 720?S MONOLITHIC DESIGN IS SEAMLESS AND EXTREMELY ELEGANT WHICH MAKES A LOT OF HEADS TURN. THE SNAP-ON COVERS THAT I PURCHASED AS AN ADD-ON ARE, I THINK, THE BEST FEATURE OF MY PHONE AS I CAN CHANGE THEM ACCORDING TO MY MOOD AND ACCORDING TO WHAT ATTIRE IT WILL GO WITH. IT FEELS LIKE HAVING AN ENTIRELY NEW PHONE EVERY TIME I CHANGE THE COVER. APART FROM THE AESTHETICS, THE COVERS ALSO ALLOWS ME CHARGE MY LUMIA 720 WIRELESSLY, WHICH SAVES ME THE HASSLES OF CARRYING THE MESSY WIRED CHARGER EVERYWHERE, AND LETS ME CHARGE ON THE GO.
      
      
      THE 4.3-INCH DISPLAY OF MY LUMIA 720 IS HUMONGOUS AND CLASSY. THE TRUECOLOR DISPLAY MAKES MY PICTURES AND VIDEOS LIFE-LIKE. THE PHONE IS EXTREMELY PROMPT AND RESPONSIVE. IT WORKS WONDERS WITH A MERE SWIPE. I AM A ROUGH AND A KIND OF CARELESS USER WHO KEEPS DROPPING AND BUMPING MY PHONE EVERYWHERE, BUT MY LUMIA 720 HAS A SOLUTION TO IT; ITS CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION KEEPS THE SCREEN INTACT AND DISTORT FREE.
      
      
      LUMIA PHONES ARE FAMED FOR THEIR CAMERAS AND MY LUMIA 720 IS NO EXCEPTION TO IT, AS IT CARRIES FORWARD THIS LEGACY. ITS ABILITY TO CLICK PICTURES IN LOW LIGHT IS JUST AMAZING. THE 6.7 MP WIDE-ANGLE CAMERA MAKES SURE TO CAPTURE EVERY MINUTE DETAIL WITH EASE. THE NEW SMART SHOOT LENS WITH ITS ERASE FEATURE LETS ME GET RID OF THOSE IRRITATING PHOTO BOMBERS AND PASSER-BYS KEEN ON SPOILING THE SNAP. EVEN THE FRONT CAMERA RENDERS TERRIFIC QUALITY AND COMES WITH ADD-ONS TO EDIT MY PHOTOGRAPHS WITH EFFECTS LIKE TEETH WHITENING AND VARYING SKIN TONES. I NOW CLICK PHOTOS AND DIRECTLY UPLOAD THEM ON FACEBOOK IN A WINK.
      
      
      THE WINDOWS 8 OS IS JUST AWESOME. WITH FEATURES LIKE LIVE TILES, HIGH-QUALITY DISPLAY AND VISUALS, I JUST CAN?T GET ENOUGH OF MY LUMIA 720. THE PHONE CAME PRELOADED WITH LOTS OF USEFUL APPS LIKE HERE MAPS WITH LIVESIGHT, NOKIA MIX RADIO, AND NOKIA GIG FINDER TO MAKE MY DAY EASIER AND A LOT MORE FUN THAN USUAL. I CAN CUSTOMISE MY PHONE?S DISPLAY IN A MILLION WAYS TO SUIT MY REQUIREMENTS, HENCE MAKING IT VERY FLEXIBLE AND USER-FRIENDLY.
      
      
      MY LUMIA 720 HAS NOW BECOME A PART AND PARCEL OF ME AND I JUST CAN?T STAY AWAY FROM IT. IT?S A GREAT PHONE AND A MUST BUY TOO. SO IF YOU WANT A REAL ?SMARTPHONE? WITHOUT BURNING A HOLE IN YOUR POCKET, LET YOUR SEARCH END AT THE NOKIA LUMIA 720!"

Nokia Lumia 720,5,"FINALLY I GOT A PHONE THAT IS INDEED VERY EXCEPTIONAL AND ONE OF ITS KIND! I AM TALKING ABOUT THE NEW AND UPGRADED NOKIA LUMIA 720, WHICH I LATELY PURCHASED. THIS SMARTPHONE IS POSITIONED FLAWLESSLY BETWEEN LUMIA 620 AND 820. INITIALLY I WAS A BIT HESITANT ABOUT PUTTING MY MONEY ON A NON-ANDROID PHONE, BUT TRUST ME I STILL HAVEN?T GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. WITH A POWER-PACKED DUAL CORE 1 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR, MY PHONE GIVES ME AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE EVERY TIME.

Nokia Lumia 720,5,"GOT A RED LUMIA 720  YESTERDAY. I USUALLY NEVER PREFER WRITING REVIEWS BUT FLIPKART FOR THEIR AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE REALLY NEEDS A STANDING OVATION, IF NOT, THEN AT LEAST FEW WORDS OF APPRECIATION - FLIPKART TEAM YOU ROCK !!!!
      
      1) I AM LOCATED IN BANGALORE WHERE THE BIG MULTI BRAND MOBILE STORES ARE UNIVERCELL AND SANGEETHA. BOTH THESE STORES AND SOME OTHERS QUOTE LUMIA 720 FOR APPX. 18300/- THAT TOO WITH LIMITED COLOR OPTIONS WHERE AS ON FLIPKART LUMIA 720 IS AVAILABE FOR APPX. 17000/-
      
      2) COMING OVER TO THE PHONE IF BELOW REQUIREMENTS MATCHES WITH YOURS THEN LOOK NOWHERE AROUND AND GO FOR LUMIA 720

      - LIGHT, SLEEK AND JAW DROPPING LOOKS
      
      - NOT A HEAVY GAMER
      
      - OPEN MINDED AND READY TO EXPERIENCE BEFORE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS TOWARDS WP8
      
      - GOT BORED WITH ANDROID AND LOOKING FOR A REFRESHING OS
      
      - EXCELLENT CAMERA IS ON YOUR TOP THREE REQUIREMENT
      
      
      SOME VERY BASIC ADVANTAGES WHICH YOU WON'T FIND IN OTHER MOBILES IN THIS RANGE

Nokia Lumia 720,5,"GOT IT YESTERDAY...!! WHAT A PHONE.. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID DON'T GO FOR WINDOWS PHONE AS IT  DOES'T HAVE ""APPS""...

Nokia Lumia 720,5,"HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 3.5MONTHS...
      
      
      PROS:
      
      - SLIM AND COMPACT DESIGN - VERY CLASSY
      
      - BATTERY LIFE IS AMAZING..., STAYS FOR 2 FULL DAYS ON DAY-TO-DAY REGULAR USAGE.. {1HOUR CALLS, FULL TIME WIFI, 20-30MINS GAMING EVERYDAY}
      
      - HERE MAPS/DRIVE - AWESOME.. BEST MAPS APP AVAILABLE.. OFFLINE MAP FEATURE HELPS A LOT AS IT DOESNT REQUIRE DATA CONNECTION DURING TRAVEL.
      
      - CAMERA QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD EVEN N LOW LIGHT
      
      - CLEAR AND CRISP AUDIO OUTPUT IN CROWDED AREA.. (COULD CLEARLY HEAR AND TALK WHILE IN RAILWAY STATION WITH A TRAIN APPROACHING SOUND IN THE BACKGROUND)
      
      - BEAUTIFUL, AND EASY TO USE INTERFACE... NEVER GET BORED
      
      
      CONS:
      
      - A BIT SLIPPERY FOR THE HANDS
      
      - NOT MANY GAMES TO PLAY..
      
      - GOT STUCK TWO-THREE TIME {WHICH GOT RESOLVED A SOFT RESTART} - IGNORABLE
      
      
      WOULD RATE IT 5/5 AS IT'S HARD TO FIND ANY NEGATIVES FOR A REGULAR USER. I HAVE USED GALAXY S2 BEFORE, AND THIS ONE IS LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF ANDROID 2.3 PHONES.. IN USABILITY.."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"HEY GUYS, I BOUGHT LUMIA 720 LAST WEEK AND I'M SHARING MY EXPERIENCES WITH YOU.
      
      
      FIRST OF ALL, I ORDERED MY PHONE ON 16-TH AND RECEIVED IT ON 17-TH WITH GREAT PACKAGING. NOBODY DOES IT BETTER THAN FLIPKART.
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PHONE, THIS IS THE BEST PHONE IN THE MARKET WITHIN 20K RANGE. I HAVE EXPLORED A LOT OF PHONE BEFORE BUYING IT AND 720 HAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN LOT MANY ASPECTS.
      
      THESE ARE SOME OF THEM (ACCORDING TO MY EXPIRENCE):
      
      
      1) TOUCH: THE SUPER SENSITIVE TOUCH IS THE BEST. THIS PHONE REDEFINES FEATHER TOUCH (WITH GLOVES ALSO WORKS GREAT).
      
      2) DISPLAY AND DESIGN: AMOLED SCREEN WITH GORILLA GLASS 2 GIVES A SUPERB LOOK WITH HIGH CONTRAST DISPLAY. BETTER THAN ANY PHONE IN THIS RANGE. WITH SLIM DESIGN, IT GIVES A VERY PREMIUM FEEL.
      
      3) OS: WINDOWS 8 IS TRULY REFRESHING WITH A GREAT UI AND WORKS FLAWLESSLY WHILE DOING MULTITASKING. I RAN 8 APPS IN THE BACKGROUND, WORKED WITHOUT A GLITCH. IT IS SIMPLE BUT VERY EFFICIENT.
      
      4) RAM: LOTS OF PEOPLE R WONDERING ABOUT 512 MB RAM BUT LET ME TELL YOU GUYS, IT IS NOT AN ISSUE. I HAVE INSTALLED HEAVY GAMES, DONE MANY SIMULTANEOUS TASKS BUT NEVER FELT ANY MEMORY PROBLEM. TRULY SPEAKING 512 MB OF WP RAM IS EQUAL TO 1 GB IN ANDROID PHONE.
      
      5) BATTERY: WITH EXTENSIVE USE (WI-FI, GAMING, BT) IT LASTS A DAY. ALTHOUGH IF YOU SWITCH OFF YOUR WI-FI OR IN A BATTERY SAVER MODE IT EASILY LASTS 2 DAYS.
      
      6) AUDIO: IT IS ALSO VERY GOOD THOUGH THE HEADSET IS NOT SO GOOD. YOU MIGHT GO FOR A GOOD QUALITY HEADSET IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE A GREAT QUALITY AUDIO.
      
      7) CAMERA: JUST ONE WORD? WOW!! AWESOME CLARITY. IT IS SIMILAR TO LUMIA 920. LOW LIGHT PICTURES ARE AMAZING. WITH A LITTLE EFFORT YOU CAN GO PRO. VIDEO QUALITY IS ALSO VERY NICE.
      
      8) APPS: NOT A CON. THERE ARE LOT OF APPS FOR DAILY USE THAT SOLVES ALMOST 85% OF YOUR NEEDS. FEW OF THEM YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR BUT THAT COSTS YOU A NOT MORE THAN A TOP UP.
      
      
      THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS I STILL NEED TO EXPLORE BUT WITH MY 1 WEEK EXPERIENCE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS THE BEST PHONE IN THIS RANGE AND YOU WILL LOVE IT."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"HI FRIENDS
      
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE RECENTLY AND IT IS AN AMAZING PHONE.
      
      FEATURES ARE A LOT COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER MOBILE WITH THE SAME PRICE RANGE AND IS MORE SLEEK AND TRENDY.
      
      
      REALLY LIKED THE PHONE ON THE USER INTERFACE, SIMPLE AND TRENDY.
      
      
      LOVED THE WAY WINDOWS 8 IS AND ALSO THE WAY IT PRESENTS EACH AND EVERY APP TO YOU.
      
      
      PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT ANDROID PHONES ARE BEST BUT SERIOUSLY LUMIA IS MUCH BETTER THAN AN ANDROID PHONES AS IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ANDROID INTERFACE.
      
      
      INITIALLY I ALSO WAS IN A DOUBT THAT Y THIS PHONE IS RATED 4.5/5 BUT NOW I AM VERY MUCH SATISFIED.
      
      
      THANKS NOKIA AND WINDOWS 8 FOR THIS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I AM COMING FROM GALAXY S2 TO LUMIA 720
      
      USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST 2 WEEKS NOW. WELL ANDRIOD IS ANDRIOD AND WP IS WP. CANT COMPARE APPLES TO ORANGES.
      
      PROS.
      
      AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME DESIGN, FEELS SO SEXY TO HOLD IT
      
      I AM USING PROSHOT AS THE CAMERA APP AND ITS SUPERB
      
      NOKIA MUSIC ROCKS
      
      REALLY NICE BATTERY LIFE
      
      AND MANY MORE
      
      
      CONS
      
      NOTHING IS RELATED TO PHONE, BUT THE OS, SADLY IT IS NOT AS CUSTOMIZABLE AS ANDRIOD
      
      BUT IT IS QUICK
      
      CREATING/CHANGING PLAYLIST IS A PAIN, HAVE TO DO IT VIA PC
      
      UPDATES FOR APPS OR NOKIA DOESNT NECCESSARILY SHOW, THEY ARE PRESENT BUT YOU DONT KNW
      
      I FOUND VIBRATION ON THE LOW SIDE, IT WAS ON MY OFFICE DESK, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME BUT I COULDNT NOTICE IT
      
      
      BUT, I LIKE THIS PHONE WITH ITS FAULTS FOR ITS SHEER BEAUTY
      
      
      THANKS FLIPKART AND WS RETAIL FOR QUICK DELIVERY"
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I AM NOT GOING TO COMPARE NOKIA LUMIA 720 WITH OTHER PHONES, AS I DON?T HAVE EXPERIENCE. I AM JUST GIVING MY EXPERIENCE ON THIS PHONE AS A REGULAR USER. I AM NOT GOING TO REVIEW FLIPKART?S SERVICE AS THE EXPERIENCE IS GREAT AS USUAL.
      
      
      I ORDERED TWO 720S, ONE FOR MY WIFE AND ONE FOR MYSELF.  WE ARE USING THE PHONE FOR PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. FOLLOWING IS OUR EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      1.	WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, WE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE LOOKS OF THIS PHONE AT THE FIRST SIGHT. IT LOOKS SO ELEGANT AND WELL BUILT. IT IS DEFIANTLY ONE OF THE GREAT LOOKING HANDSETS. MY WIFE HAVING USED SAMSUNG GALAXY ACE BEFORE, THE BUILD QUALITY FELT GREAT FOR HER.
      
      2.	I HAVE KEPT MY PHONE FOR FIRST CHARGE FOR 5 TO 6 HOURS OVER NIGHT. SINCE THEN PHONE PROVIDED BATTERY LIFE FOR PAST 2 FULL DAYS. STILL AROUND 40% OF BATTERY LEFT AS I TYPE THIS REVIEW. I MUST ADMIT THAT I AM NOT A POWER USER. I HAVE USED WIFI NOW AND THEN TO DOWNLOAD APPS. I HAVE USED 3G NOW AND THEN WHEN I WAS IN OFFICE. GPS IS TURNED OFF EXCEPT FOR 10 MINUTES OR SO. I HAVEN?T PLAYED ANY VIDEOS SO FAR. FEW PHONE CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGES HERE AND THERE. THIS WAS MY USAGE PATTERN FOR PAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND THIS WOULD BE MY DAY-TO-DAY USAGE. AT THIS RATE, I AM IMPRESSED WITH THE BATTERY LIFE. POWER USERS AND HEAVY GAMERS WOULD GET LESS TIME BETWEEN BATTERY CHARGES, BUT I BELIEVE IT WOULD SERVE ANYWHERE BETWEEN A DAY AND TWO ON A SINGLE CHARGE.
      
      3.	TODAY I HAD TO TAKE OUT MY PHONE IN OUTDOOR DAYLIGHT. DAYLIGHT SCREEN VISIBILITY IS GREAT.
      
      4.	I GOT ALL MY NECESSARY APPS FROM MARKET PLACE. LIKE ? SKYPE, ACROBAT READER, TODO MANAGER, HDFC APP, CRICINFO, UC BROWSER, AND NOKIA STUFFS LIKE CITY LENS, HERE DRIVE, ETC. I DON?T HAVE ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT AVAILABILITY OF MY KIND OF APPS. I HAVEN?T DOWNLOADED ANY GAMES YET. ANGRY BIRDS COST RS. 55 HERE WHICH I BELIEVE FREE IN GOOGLE PLAY.
      
      5.	MYSELF AND MY BETTER HALF LOVE PHOTOGRAPHY. WE ARE NOT GOOD PHOTOGRAPHERS, THOUGH. FOR A LONG TIME WE DIDN?T HAVE A DECENT PHOTOGRAPHY DEVICE. POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA WHICH WE HAVE IS A CRAP, WHICH MADE GALAXY ACE?S CAMERA SEEMS BETTER. WE ARE REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE CAMERA OF 720S. LOW LIGHT PHOTOS CAME REALLY WELL AND CLEAR. WE KIND-OF EXPLORING THE ?LENSES? (PLUGIN KIND) AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS PHONE. THEY ARE GREAT. NOW WE ARE HOLDING A GOOD (IF NOT GREAT) PHOTOGRAPHY DEVICE.
      
      6.	WE ARE FB ADDICTS. BUT, I MUST ADMIT THAT, I HAVEN?T TRIED FACEBOOK IN 720. AS OTHERS REVIEWED, IT SHOULD BE A GREAT EXPERIENCE AS WELL.
      
      
      TO SUMMARIZE ? WE LOVE OUR NOKIA LUMIA 720."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I AM SURE ANDROID USERS MUST BE HATING THIS ONE, SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS PHONE IS A KILLER. BATTERY BACKUP IS IMMENSE, BELIEVE ME. I WATCHED 2 HD 1080 MOVIES ON THIS BACK TO BACK AND LOST JUST 20 % OF BATTERY IN A WHOLE DAY.
      
      
      NOT ONLY THAT ITS A FASTER OS THAN ANDROID. SO ITS RIGHTLY SAID THAT IT HAS A BETTER QUALITY WITH AWESOME TOUCH. I WENT TO BUY THE NOKIA 520 BUT INSTANTLY BOUGHT THIS ONE, FELL IN LOVE WITH ITS LOOKS. BOY IT LOOKS AMAZING. THE CAMERA IS AWESOME, NEED TO SAY THAT?
      
      
      I WILL SAY ITS A STEP AHEAD, ITS A COMPLETE PHONE, ITS GOES LONG, HAS ABILITY TO PLAY 1080 HD VIDEOS AND GIVES YOU OUTSTANDING GPS SUPPORT WITH PERSONALIZED MAPS FROM NOKIA.
      
      
      BUY THIS. I WAS HATING NOKIA FOR THE ASHA SERIES. NOW THEY GOT MY LOYALTY BACK."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM THE PAST 2 WEEKS AND IT HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. DISPLAY, GAMING, MUSIC, CAMERA, TOUCH EVERYTHING IS JUST PERFECT.....  I LOVE MY LUMIA 720.
      
      
      GO FOR THIS PHONE IF YOU ARE WILLING TO BUY A GOOD SMART PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I AM WONDERING WHETHER IT'S YOUR PHONE WHICH IS CRAZY OR YOU YOURSELF ARE. HOW CAN SO MANY CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN TO A SINGLE PERSON. I THINK NOKIA &AMP; MICROSOFT IS TAKING SOME KIND OF REVENGE FROM YOU.
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE 3 WEEKS TOO AND I AM PROUD TO OWN IT. NO SINGLE PROBLEM TILL NOW. IN FACT I FEEL THAT NO OTHER MANUFACTURER WHO CAN PROVIDE SUCH A WONDERFUL PHONE AT SUCH A  PRICE.
      
      
      I HAVE NOTICED THAT CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN TO CRAZY PEOPLE. GUD LUCK BINU...HA HA HA HA..LOLZ"
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I BOUGHT THIS BROUGHT 2MONTHS BACK. STILL I CANT EVEN BE WITHOUT MY MOBILE FOR A SINGLE DAY. ENJOYING EACH AND EVERY SECOND.
      
      
      ADVANTAGES:
      
      
      * BEST CAMERA QUALITY.
      
      * EASILY ACCESS YOUR FB, TWITTER IN WINDOWS ACCOUNT FROM PHOTOS AND CONTACTS
      
      * FASTER OS (NOW WINDOWS ANNOUNCED WINDOWS 8 MOBILE OS CAN BE UPGRADABLE TO WINDOWS BLUE MOBILE OS IN FUTURE)
      
      * AWESOME PERFORMACE (DONT THINK THAT 512 RAM IS NOT ENOUGH. WINDOWS 8 IS VERY LIGHT WEIGHT OS THAN ANDROID AND IOS. I HAVE INSTALLED MORE THAN 50 APPS IN MY MOBILE. STILL MY MOBILE FASTER LIKE I BOUGHT)
      
      * MOST OF THE APPS WILL GET IN WINDOWS LIKE ANDROID
      
      
      DISADVANTAGES:
      
      
      * WE CANT SHARE VIDEO FILES THROUGH BLUETOOTH
      
      * NOONE KNOWS WHERE THE VIDEO FILES ARE GETTING SAVE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM OTHER MOBILES THROUGH BLUETOOTH. I HAVE SEARCHED BY CONNECTING WITH PC. NO USE :(
      
      * SOME TIMES MOBILE GETS HANG. INTHAT CASE WE HAVE TO LONG PRESS POWER KEY + VOLUME TO RESTART ( DONT WORRY GUYS, IT WONT HAPPEN OFTEN. FOR ME IT HAPPENED ONLY ONCE IN LAST 2MONTHS)
      
      * WE CANT TAKE OFF BACK PANEL FROM MOBILE
      
      
      IN A FUTURE, WINDOWS OS WILL RULE IN SMARTPHONES WORLD. ALLOVER ITS WORTH OF 18K."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I BOUGHT THIS FONE FRM NOKIA PRIORITY DEALER , THAT WAS A BIT COSTLY THAN FLIPKART BUT I REALLY WANTED TO FEEL THIS PHONE BEFORE BUYING,
      
      AS IM USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST TWO MONTHS , ALL I CAN SAY THAT NOKIA HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB ,GREAT DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY ,AWESOME CAMERA,FANTASTIC BATTERY ,FEATHER TOUCH N MOREOVER SMOOTH N REFRESHING WINDOWS 8 IS UNBEATABLE COMBINATION.

      WINDOWS APP STORE IS GETTING BETTER DAY BY DAY,INCLUSION OF FAMOUS GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN ,FREE FLOW N MANY MORE .
      
      ALL IN ALL THIS IS BEST LUMIA DEVICE EVER . A COMPLETE PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK. I AM LOVING THIS PHONE.
      
      
      BUT WHEN MY PHONE FELL DOWNON THE FLOOR MY GORILLA GLASS BROKEN INTO PIECES. I SPENT 6K TO GET A NEW TOUCH SCREEN. I ADVICE WHOEVER BUYS THIS TO PUT A CASE!
      
      
      OTHERWISE THIS PHONE IS AWESOME"
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I BROUGHT THIS PHONE FROM A LOCAL STORE. (WHITE COLOUR) EVERYTHING IS GREAT ABOUT THIS CELL PHONE. ESPECIALLY ITS SLEEK LOOKS AND CAMERA. BUT I GOT A PROBLEM. WHEN I TALK FOR SOME TIME, SUDDENLY MY VOICE BECOMES INAUDIBLE VIA MICRO PHONE AND THE PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LINE CAN'T LISTEN TO MY VOICE. IS IT MY PROBLEM ONLY OR DOES IT HAPPEN WITH ALL OF YOU ? PLEASE HELP ME."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I CAN SAY THAT LUMIA 720 IS THE BEST MIDRANGE WP ONE CAN BUY, WINDOWS OS IS SMOOTH AND BUTTERY, AND LUMIA 720 IS SLIM AND SEXY....SOUND QUALITY,DISPLAY, CAMERA ALL ARE VERY GOOD AND OVERALL ITS VALUE FOR MONEY, ONE CAN ADD A MICRO SD WHI ARE CONCERNED FOR INTERNAL MEMORY IT OFFERS OUT OF THE BOX SO NO SPACE CONSTRAINTS.. OVERALL A NICE PHONE TO HAVE."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I DID TAKE THE DECESSION AFTER LONG RESEARCH.. I HAD SAMSUNG S2 AND NOW I OWN THE LUMIA 720. AS OF NOW I DO NOT HAVE ANY DISAPPOINMENT FOR ANDRIOD.
      
      I ORDERD THE PHONE LAST FRIDDAY EVENING AND RECEIVED ON THE NEXT DAY EVENING. - THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR EXCELLENT SERVICE.
      
      THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD COMPARED TO OTHER IN THIS RANGE. AS  OF NOW I AM NOT FACING ANY ISSUES. THE DISPLAY AND TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY GOOD .. I LOVE THIS. THE CAMERA IS ALSO VERY GOOD. ONE THING THAT I HAVE NOT DISCOVERED YET TO CONTROL THE VOLUME WHILE LISTENING MUSIC. I COULD NOT FIND ANY OPTION AS OF NOW. BUT DEFINITELY WILL GET IT.
      
      
      OVER ALL RATING IS 5 OUT OF 5."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I GUESS THERE IS NO OTHER PHONE ON THIS EARTH WHICH PROVIDES SUCH A NICE UI, MAKE &AMP; DESIGN AT THIS PRICE CATEGORY.
      
      
      I AM NOT A GAMER AND NOT A HOPELESS APP HUNGRY. SO MY LUMIA 720 PROVIDES ME WITH ALL I NEED. INDEED I WOULD SAY I GOT MORE THEN WHAT I NEED. OFFICE SUITE IS EXTRAORDINARY. I NEVER THOUGHT, EDITING AN EXCEL FILE WOULD BE SO MUCH EASY ON A MOBILE FILE. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T DO ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN DO ON A DESKTOP, STILL YOU CAN DO ALL THE BASIC OFFICE FILE EDITING WHEN YOU ARE MOVING OR YOU ARE NOT IN OFFICE.
      
      
      EMAIL SETUP IS GREAT. I SET UP 2 ACCOUNTS AND I GET EMAILS SIMULTANEOUSLY ON BOTH THE ACCOUNTS. ALSO IT'S VERY EASY TO SAVE THE ATTACHMENT FILES TO SKY-DRIVE OR ATTACH A FILE FROM SKY-DRIVE OR INTERNAL MEMORY DIRECTLY WITH SO EASE. THIS PHONE COMPLETES ME IN ALL THE WAY. JUST A GREAT PHONE. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO PEOPLE WHO USE PHONE FOR WORK PURPOSE AND NOT FOR GAMING."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR PAST TWO WEEKS AND I MUST TELL, IT S PLEASURE TO MEET THE BEST! I WAS LOOKING FOR A TOUCH PHONE WITH GOOD BATTERY LIFE. I HAVE GOT A BONUS OF COOL CAMERA, AWESOME TOUCH AND A BIGGER DISPLAY. FOR A MODERATE USE, THIS PHONE STAYS FOR 36 HRS ( I CHARGE IT AFTER THAT) WITH AROUND 20- 25% REMAINING WHICH WOULD AGAIN LAST FOR  ANOTHER 8 MORE HRS. YOU LL GET ALL THOSE APPS THAT YOU USE ON DAILY BASIS IN WINDOWS PHONE AS WELL, FOR FREE AND THEREFORE COMPARING IT WITH ANDROID FOR LESSER AVAILABILITY OF APPS DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PHONE IS JUST AMAZING. THE MEMORY UTILIZATION IS GREAT. EVEN 512 MB RAM IS NOT CAUSING THE PHONE TO SLOW DOWN. I AGREE THAT YOU CANNOT INSTALL HIGH END GAMES AND APPS INTO IT DUE THE RAM , BUT IT SUPPORTS ALL THE ESSENTIAL APPS AND GAMES REQUIRED. NOKIA HAS PUT ALL ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THIS PHONE. THE FEATURE OF CITY LENS IS JUST AMAZING. ALL TOGETHER IT IS A GREAT PHONE AT A GREAT PRICE."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I LOVE THE SYMBIAN SIMPLICITY.........AND I ALSO LOVE HOW WINDOWS IS WORKING HARD TO BE AS SIMPLE AS A SYMBIAN PHONE.....BUT WITH THE CAPACITY TO DO A VARIETY OF TASKS ....THAT I WOULDNT EVEN DREAM OF DOING WITH A SYMBIAN PHONE.
      
      
      I HAD INCORPORATED DAVID ALLENS GTD SYSTEM IN NOKIA X2.  IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY..IT TOOK TIME TO FIND OUT HOW TO ...BUT I HAD DONE IT IN THE END.
      
      
      I STILL  USE MY OLD NOKIA X2( NOT AS A PHONE ..BUT AS A FILE MANAGER..) ALONG  WITH THE NEW LUMIA 720.
      
      
      SINCE I OWN A 720 NOW.....I'LL SEE HOW DO I MAKE IT WORK AS MY GTD SYSTEM.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL I AM LOVING THE BIG SCREEN.......THE CAMERA QUALITY.
      
      THE UI OF WINDOWS IS TRULY ' TOUCHING'....WITH LIVE TILES.

Nokia Lumia 720,5,"I WANT TO GIVE YOU(THE BUYER) THE REAL FACTS ABOUT THE PHONE AND WHAT TO EXPECT.
      
      I KNOW FOR SOME PEOPLE ITS A BIG GAMBLE TO SWITCH TO LUMIA IF YOU ARE AN ANDROID USER.BUT TRUST ME,THIS IS A PHONE YOU WANT TO GET!!
      
      NOW,I TOOK THIS GAMBLE &AMP; HIT A JACKPOT!
      
      ITS SUCH A REFRESHING PHONE!! ITS STANDS OUT FROM THE CROWD WITH ITS WONDERFUL OS AND ITS VIBRANT COLOURS.
      
      1.} THE OS ~ THE OS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS PHONE.
      
      NOKIA HAS GIVEN TONS OF PRE INSTALLED APP(NOT WHATSAPP) WHICH ARE EXTREMLEY USEFUL IN DAY TO DAY LIFE.
      
      2.} APPS ~ NOW I AM NOT SUCH A BIG GAMER AS SUCH BUT I DO LIKE TO PASS TIME BUY PLAYING ONE &AMP; THIS PHONE FULFILLS THAT NEED PERFECTLY.BUT IF YOU'RE A HARDCORE GAMER......I SUGGEST YOU LOOK FOR AN ANOTHER PHONE.BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR APPS,YOU WILL NOT HAVE A PROBLEM.
      
      3.} CAMERA ~ THE SHOOTER ON THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT POINT BECAUSE OF ITS 6.7 MP CAMERA &AMP; CARL ZEISS LENS.
      
      4.} DESIGN ~ THE DESIGN IS BEAUTIFUL.ITS QUITE BIG IN YOUR HAND AND ITS LIGHT WEIGHT.
      
      
      THE VERDICT - WHATS BETTER THAN A WINDOWS 8 OS PHONE FROM OUR TRUST WORTHY FRIEND &AMP; PAL N O K I A."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,I WOULD HAVE TO RATE IT AS A GREAT PHONE IN THIS RANGE. CAMERA IS SIMPLY SUPERB AND ALSO THE UNLIMITED MUSIC DOWNLOAD IN NOKIA MUSIC IS QUITE AN UNIQUE FEATURE. OVERALL THE APPS FOR CAMERA IS ALSO EXCELLENT. VERY HAPPY THAT I PICKED THIS PHONE..
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"IF YOU ARE CONFUSED WHICH PHONE TO BUY IN 15-18K RANGE, THEN WITHOUT HESITATION GO FOR LUMIA 720, U WON'T REGRET IT AT ALL. THE BEST ANDROID PHONE I FOUND IN THIS RANGE WAS XPERIA L THAT I ALMOST FINALIZED. BUT WHEN I HAD A LOOK AT XPERIA L AND LUMIA 720 IN CHROMA I MUST SAY NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS THE PHONE YOU WANT TO HAVE IN YOUR HAND ! EVERYTHING FROM THE SLEEK, SHARP, GLOSSY, BUTTERY AND REFRESHING LOOKS TO THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS OF THIS PHONE ARE AMAZING. DISPLAY AND TOUCH ARE SO SO GOOD THAT I KEEP ON UNLOCKING THE PHONE AGAIN AND AGAIN WITHOUT A REASON, AND I SCROLL UP AND DOWN AND SIDEWAYS AND THEN AGAIN LOCK IT :P.
      
      
      THE 6.7 MP CAMERA IS OUTSTANDING IN DAY OR EVEN NIGHT. FRONT CAMERA IS ALSO GOOD. TOUCH IS SUPER BUTTERY, NO LAGS IN THE PHONE, GREAT BATTERY. I HEARD THAT GAMING MAY BE A PROBLEM IN THIS PHONE, BUT ITS NOTHING LIKE THAT. GAMES ARE RUNNING VERY SMOOTH.
      
      
      IF WE TALK OF APPS THEN I FOUND ALL THE IMPORTANT APPS THAT ONE NEEDS ARE PRESENT IN THE STORE FREE OF COST. NOKIA MAPS ARE AGAIN AN ADVANTAGE, U CAN USE IT OFFLINE AS WELL AND IS VERY GOOD.
      
      
      MANY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RAM BEING 512 MB. WELL WINDOWS PHONE DON'T NEED MUCH HIGHER RAMS. 1 GB AND ABOVE ARE GOOD FOR ANDROID PHONES.
      
      
      FEW PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PHONE, THAT IT GOES DEAD AFTER 1-2 DAYS OF USAGE AND I WAS ONE OF THEM !! :P. THAT IS TRUE. MY PHONE ALSO WENT DEAD AND WAS NOT RESPONDING TO ANY OF THE KEYS. NOTHING HAPPENED, IT WAS NUMB. THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE PHONE HAS TO BE CHARGED COMPLETELY BEFORE FIRST USAGE, EVEN IF IT HAS 70 - 80% BATTERY OUT OF THE BOX (AS TOLD BY NOKIA CARE). PHONE GOES INTO SLEEP MODE IF NOT INITIALLY CHARGED PROPERLY. THEY PROVIDED ME A SOLUTION FOR THIS WHICH IS PRESS THE VOLUME DOWN KEY BUTTON AND THE POWER BUTTON SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR 10 SECONDS. THE PHONE WILL START AGAIN AND ONCE CHARGED COMPLETELY IT SHOULD BE ALL PERFECT !! I AM NOT FACING ANY PROBLEMS SINCE MY FIRST COMPLETE CHARGE :D. HOPE THIS WILL GIVE RELIEF TO A LOT OF LUMIA 720 BUYERS !!
      
      
      AT THE END I WOULD JUST SAY GO FOR THE PHONE, ITS COMPLETELY WORTH IT AND IS MUCH BETTER THEN GETTING A 40K PHONE WHICH WILL AGAIN REDUCE TO 25K IN 3-4 MONTHS WITH ANOTHER NEW VERSION OF  ANDROID FOR 45K !!"
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"IF YOU'V GOT 18,000 AND DONT NO WHICH SMARTPHONE TO GO FOR.. THIS SHOULD BE IT... ITS JUST BEEN 2 WEEKS SINCE I USED IT AND ITS AMAZING.. REALLY GOOD IMPORTANT APPS .. AND ALSO HIGH GRAPHIC DETAILED GAMES..  AND YEAH THIS PHONE STAYS AHEAD OF  THE ENTIRE LUMIA RANGE OF PHONES BY..
      
      
      1. SLEEKEST LUMIA YET.
      
      
      2. LONGEST AND BEST BATTERY AMONGST THE LUMIA'S (I CHARGE IT ONLY ONCE IN 2 DAYS)
      
      
      3.BEST LOW LIGHT IMAGING CAMERA APERTURE,WHICH IS NOT SEEN IN ANY OTHER SMARTPHONE YET.
      
      
      4.BEST EVER BUILT LUMIA, AS IT IS UNIBODY DESIGN
      
      
      5.HAS SCULPTED CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 WITH IPS DISPLAY FOR ULTIMATE VIEWING ANGLES .. WHICH IS THERE ONLY IN LUMIA 920, AND NO OTHER    LUMIA..
      
      
      6.HD FRONT FACING CAMERA.. ONLY IN 720 AND 920..
      
      
      7. INVISIBLE SENORS ON THE PHONE ..(GYROSCOPES , PROXIMITY SENSORS , DIGITAL COMPASS, GEO TAGGING.)
      
      
      THESE ARE NOT JUST REVIEWS BUT FACTS THAT ARE PUT UP IN CNET.COM REVIEWS..
      
      
      WINDOWS PLATFORM IS THE BEST THAT I'V EVER USED IN MY LIFE..
      
      
      ( I'V USED ANDROID AND IOS ..  THEY SUCK AS THEY HAVE THIER OWN DISADVANTAGE"
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"IN SHORT, THE BEST EVER WINDOWS PHONE, YOU'LL FORGET ANDROID. NOKIA AND WINDOWS 8 (NOT 7, MIND YOU) IS A GREAT COMBINATION AND THE HARDWARE AND FORM FACTOR OF LUMIA 720 IS POSSIBLY THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY, I'D SAY BETTER THAN 820 AS WELL AS 920 !!!
      
      
      FINALLY - BEST PRICE ON FLIPKART, AND BSET DELIVERY - POSSIBLY NO ONE CAN BEAT THIS."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"IN SOME WAYS, THE LUMIA 720 IS EVERYTHING WE?VE ASKED FOR FROM NOKIA. IT?S SLICKLY DESIGNED AND HAS SUPERLATIVE BATTERY LIFE, THE CAMERA OUT-PERFORMS RIVALS IN THE SAME PRICE BRACKET, AND THE SCREEN ? THOUGH LOWER RESOLUTION THAN WE LIKE ? IS A NICE COMPROMISE OF SIZE, OUTDOOR USABILITY, AND GENERAL CLARITY.
      
      IF YOU WANT A CHEAP LUMIA THAT DOES THE JOB A WINDOWS PHONE 8 SMARTPHONE SHOULD, THEN YOU CAN?T GO WRONG WITH THE LUMIA 720.IF YOU?RE AFTER AN AFFORDABLE WINDOWS PHONE 8 HANDSET THAT PERFORMS WELL, THE NOKIA LUMIA 720 SHOULD NOT BE RULED OUT.
      
      YOU GET A LOT FOR YOUR CASH, AND IT?S WORTH CHECKING OUT IF YOU?VE ONLY BEEN CONSIDERING YET ANOTHER ANDROID HANDSET."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"IT WAS A WARM (AND FLUID) WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF WINDOWS PHONE 8 AND IT WAS A RELIEF FROM THE FROZEN COLD UTOPIA OF ANDROID. (PUN INTENDED)
      
      WELL, I'M NOT SAYING ANDROID SUCKS, BUT THAT WINDOWS IS WAY BETTER.
      
      
      SPEED: LIGHT YEARS (AS IN DISTANCE) AHEAD OF ANDROID. I REMEMBER DOING THE SAME THINGS LIKE WEB BROWSING, SOCIAL NETWORKING, WHATSAPP-ING, NAVIGATION, ETC. ON A COUPLE OF ANDROIDS AND I LIKED THE FLUIDITY WITH WHICH WINDOWS OPERATES.
      
      
      LOOKS AND BUILD: OH WHAT CAN I SAY... AT 9MM, THE PHONE LOOKS SEXY, AND THE CURVED GLASS EDGES AND GORILLA CORNING GLASS AT THAT, GIVES IT A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED FEEL. BEING A UNIBODY DESIGN, THE PHONE FEELS SOLID IN YOUR HAND, AND AT THE SAME TIME, SITS COMFORTABLY IN YOUR POCKET. IF YOU USE A NORMAL SIM, JUST WALK TO ANY OF THE NOKIA CARE CENTRES AND THEY'LL CUT THE SIM FOR YOU FOR FREE. THE PHYSICAL BUTTONS ARE OF A GOOD QUALITY TOO!
      
      
      EFFICIENCY: NO CRASHES. THE OS IS ROCK SOLID.
      
      
      USER INTERFACE: IT IS JUST A DELIGHT TO WATCH THE TILES FLIP. AND THE NOTIFICATIONS, OF COURSE WOULD TAKE A WHILE FOR YOU TO GET USED TO IF YOU'RE SWITCHING FROM ANDROID. THE LIVE TILES MAKE YOUR LIFE EASY.
      
      
      DISPLAY: CLEARBLACK IS AWESOME! IT IS AS GOOD AS AMOLED, BUT THE COLOURS DON'T SEEM DRY - CAN IT GET ANY BETTER?
      
      
      APPS: YES, THE NUMBER IS A MAJOR PULL DOWN FOR AN APP FREAK. FACEBOOK INTEGRATION IS PERFECT AND EVERYTHING IS SYNCED TO THE CLOUD. MOST OF THE MAJOR (BRANDED) APPS AVAILABLE ON ANDROID ARE AVAILABLE IN WINDOWS TOO, AND NOKIA (AS USUAL) HAS DONE A GOOD JOB AT THINGS LIKE MAPS, NAVIGATION (OF COURSE, THEY'RE THE PIONEERS OF NAVIGATION ON PHONE!), SOCIAL NETWORK INTEGRATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
      
      
      AUDIO: UNFORTUNATELY, NOKIA DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO SONY IN THAT DEPARTMENT. SINCE I HAVE A WALKMAN, I DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT MUSIC ON MY PHONE. HOWEVER, IF YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY WITH THE EQUALISER, YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BE UNHAPPY. BUY YOURSELF A PAIR OF SONY OR SENNHEISER EARPHONES, THOUGH.
      
      
      CAMERA: OH YES! HOW CAN SOMEONE MISS THAT! LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY IS JUST AWESOME - I MEAN COMPARATIVELY. OF COURSE YOU CANNOT COMPARE THE QUALITY TO THAT OF A DSLR, BUT FOR A CELL PHONE CAMERA, THE QUALITY IS GREAT!
      
      
      SUMMING IT UP, MICROSOFT TOOK A GOOD DECISION OF SPECIFYING THE HARDWARE FOR WINDOWS PHONE 8, NOKIA, ON THE OTHER HAND HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AT CREATING AN AWESOME SET OF PHONES WITH ITS TRADEMARK QUALITY FACTOR. OVERALL, IF YOU'RE THINKING OF GETTING A PHONE THAT TAKES CARE OF NAVIGATION, COMMUNICATION, BASIC PHOTOGRAPHY, SOCIALISATION; AND BATTERY, SPEED AND EFFICIENCY BEING VERY IMPORTANT THINGS, GO FOR LUMIA 720!
      
      
      OF COURSE, IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER FIVE GRAND EXTRA, YOU CAN GO FOR AN 820, BUT 720 IS SIMPLY GREAT - NO BIG DEAL OF A DIFFERENCE ON THE PERFORMANCE END - JUST AN AMOLED SCREEN AND A GIG OF RAM ON THE HARDWARE SIDE. BOTTOM LINE, THE BEST PHONE UNDER 20 GRAND - JUST THE BEST."

Nokia Lumia 720,5,LAKHS OF PEOPLE ARE HAPPILY USING LUMIAS WITH ONLY FEW DISAPPOINTMENTS WHICH IS BUT OBVIOUS WITH ELECTRONICS. I THINK YOUR AMAZON FOOLED YOU WITH A DUPLICATE CHINESE LUMIA 720. GO TO YOUR AMAZON FORUM AND WRITE HOW THE AMAZONES FOOLED YOU. DON'T EVER COME HERE AND WRITE ALL THE BULSHITS. SHAME ON YOU.
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"MANY PPL ARE BAFFLED TO CHOOSE MOBILE PHONES.
      
      SAMSUNG LEADING ITS MARKET ONLY COZ OF ITS CHEAP MARKETING TACTICS. ALTHOUGH THEY WILL BE RELEASING PHONE EVERY DAY AND NEVER TEST THE PHONE COMPLETELY. IF YOU USE SAMSUNG PHONE FOR MORE THAN 1 YR YOU WILL SEE MORE ISSUES INDEED.
      
      
      LG - WORTH FOR MONEY
      
      HTC - GOOD IN DESIGN
      
      IPHONE - MORE EXPENSIVE
      
      SAMSUNG - COPYING SOME ONE'S DESIGN

THE PHONE IS ALSO UPBEAT WITH ALL THE LATEST APPS PRE-INSTALLED LIKE WHATSAPP AND STYLESAINT.
      
      
      I WAS ALWAYS VARY OF USING TOUCHSCREEN PHONES BECAUSE OF THE VULNERABLE DISPLAY. BUT I DON?T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT ANYMORE WITH MY NOKIA LUMIA 720. IT HAS A LARGE 4.3-INCH DISPLAY FEATURING SCULPTED GLASS THAT LOOKS GREAT AND ITS CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION KEEPS ME WORRY-FREE OF ANY HARM TO MY SUPER-SENSITIVE TOUCH SCREEN. WHEN OUT WITH FRIENDS, VIEWING FACEBOOK PICTURES IS ALWAYS DONE BY ALL ON MY PHONE! THAT?S BECAUSE IT FEATURES THE TRUECOLOR DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY THAT LETS IMAGES, VIDEOS AND ALL COME ALIVE ON MY SCREEN.

MY NOKIA LUMIA 720 KEEPS GOING FOR A LONG TIME WITH A POWERFUL 2000 MAH BATTERY."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"MY NEW NOKIA LUMIA 720 HAS BECOME MY NEW ACQUIRED LOVE THESE DAYS. BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT, I HAD WANTED TO BUY A BUDGET LEVEL PHONE AND I WAS ADVISED TO CHECK OUT THE LUMIA 720 BY A FRIEND. I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE REFRESHING LOOKS OF THE LUMIA SERIES AND THE LUMIA 720 IN PARTICULAR HAD EVERYTHING TO OFFER THAT I HAD IN MIND. IT HAS GELLED WITH MY LIFESTYLE EFFORTLESSLY AND NEVER LETS ME OUT FROM MAKING A STYLE STATEMENT.
      
      
      THE UNIBODY DESIGN MEANS MY LUMIA 720 HAS A SOLID CONSTRUCTION GIVING IT A REASSURING PRESENCE IN THE HAND. THIS HOWEVER IS NOT ALL, I HAVE ALSO BROUGHT SOME SNAP-ON COVERS THAT COMPLEMENT MY MOOD AND PERSONA WHEN I AM OUT THERE PARTYING OR DOING SERIOUS WORK. AT 128G, THE LUMIA 720 IS A DECENT WEIGHT AND IT?S A WELL-BALANCED HANDSET IN TERMS OF DIMENSIONS. ONE IMPORTANT FEATURE APART FROM ITS APPEALING LOOKS IS ITS OPTION TO CHARGE IT WIRELESSLY, THUS SAVING ME THE PAIN OF CARRYING CHARGERS AND MESSY WIRES.
      
      
      THE 4.3-INCH IPS LCD CAPACITIVE TOUCHSCREEN IS A CLASSY BIT WITH A PIXEL DENSITY OF 217PPI. ITS CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION SUBDUES MY FEAR OF SCRATCHING MY PHONE?S SCREEN. THE SUPER RESPONSIVE SCREEN EVEN RESPONDS TO THE MERE BRUSH OF MY FINGERS AND IT ALSO ALLOWS ME TO USE IT WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES ON. THAT?S A HUGE CATCH FOR ME. THE SCREEN DONS CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY, THAT BRINGS IT TO LIFE WITH HIGH-CONTRAST AND ENHANCED DISPLAY PROVIDING THE USER SEAMLESSLY UNPARALLELED READABILITY AND VIEWING ANGLES EVEN IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT.
      
      
      MY LUMIA 720 HAS INHERITED ITS CAMERA QUALITIES FROM IT ANCESTORS AND BOASTS OF A 6.7 MP PRIMARY CAMERA THAT HAS A LARGE F/1.9 LENS AND CARL ZEISS OPTICS GIVING ME HIGH-END CAMERA PERFORMANCE AND PRISTINE IMAGES EVEN IN LOW-LIGHT CONDITIONS. THE SMARTSHOOT FEATURE IS AMAZING WITH ITS ABILITY TO TAKE A STREAM OF PICS WITH A SINGLE CLICK AND THEN LATER ON INTEGRATING THE BEST PART OF EACH ONE TO MAKE A PERFECT SHOT. THE ERASE FEATURE ALLOWS ME TO DELETE THE SPOILERS FROM MY PICS. MY SMARTPHONE ALSO HAS A 1.3 MP CAMERA WITH WIDE ANGLE LENS ON THE FRONT AND WITH FEATURES LIKE GLAM ME LETS ME TAKE SELF-PORTRAITS AND EDIT THEM WITH OPTIONS LIKE TEETH WHITENING AND SKIN TAN. I NEVER LOSE OUT ON THE FB COMMENTS AND LIKES NOWADAYS.
      
      
      MY LUMIA 720 IS POWERED BY A 1 GHZ DUAL-CORE QUALCOMM MSM8227 PROCESSOR PAIRED WITH 512 MB OF RAM WHICH RUNS THE WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM. IT HAS HAD ME AMAZED RIGHT FROM ITS LAUNCH. SOME SETS OF COOL APPS MAKE THE PHONE STAND OUT FROM ITS COMPETITORS. HERE MAPS AND LIVESIGHT NEVER LET ME MISS OUT ON EATING JOINTS, SHOPPING CENTRES OR MOVIE THEATRES WHEN I AM OUT TRAVELLING. NOKIA MIX RADIO LETS ME STREAM MY FAVOURITE SONGS ANYWHERE, ANYTIME FOR FREE. THE HEALTHY 2000 MAH BATTERY OFFERS A 3G STANDBY TIME OF UP TO 520 HOURS, LEAVING NOTHING MORE TO ASK FOR."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS THE BEST PHONE WE CAN GET WITH IN 20K. I WONDER HOW SOME GUYS ARE HAVING BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS GREAT PHONE. IN ONE SENTENCE, NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS BEAUTY CLUBBED WITH PERFORMANCE. I'LL PUT HERE WHY I CHOOSE THIS PHONE OVER OTHER MODELS.
      
      1. BATTERY LIFE, 2 DAYS AT MODERATE USE IS UNBELIEVABLE!!
      
      2. WINDOWS PHONE IS VERY SWIFT, LITERALLY NO LAG AT ALL.
      
      3. CAMERA. NOW I DON'T MISS TO CAPTURE ANY OF THOSE NICE MOMENTS IN LIFE, IRRESPECTIVE OF IT BEING HAPPENING IN DAY/NIGHT.
      
      4. DESIGN, AS I SAID THIS IS ONE EYE CATCHY PIECE.
      
      5. NAVIGATION, THE BEST PART IN NOKIA, OFFLINE MAP IS THE ICING ON THE CAKE.
      
      6. BUILD QUALITY. I NEED A STURDY PHONE WHICH WILL WITHSTAND SOME ROUGH USE(I AM USUALLY CAREFUL, BUT I DROP MY PHONE EVERY NOW AND THEN :P)
      
      7. SOCIAL NETWORKING. PEOPLE HUB IS AWESOME, IT GOES BEYOND MY REQUIREMENT.
      
      8. ANDROID HAS BECOME VERY COMMON, AND THE LEADER OF THE PACK SAMSUNG IS MAKING EVERY MODEL IN THE SAME SHAPE( ONLY THICKNESS AND SCREEN SIZE VARY). IT MAY BE MY BAD, BUT I CAN'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE NUMEROUS GALAXIES, IT ALL LOOKS SAME TO ME.
      
      
      NOW, FLIPKART WAS VERY NICE TO OFFER AN UNBEATABLE PRICE OF 15,569/-, BUT IT WAS ALL RUINED WHEN THE E-KART LOGISTICS DELIVERED IT TO ANOTHER GUY WITH MY SAME NAME IN DIFFERENT ADDRESS :(. REMEMBER IT WAS A PREPAID ORDER, AND SINCE THE GUY WHO RECEIVED IT WAS GOOD AT HEART HE GAVE IT BACK TO ME(HE CONTACTED ME ON THE ADDRESS WRITTEN ON THE PACKAGE!! :O)
      
      NOW WHEN I CONTACTED FLIPKART I WAS TOLD THE MOBILE CAN BE TRACKED, OKAY IT CAN BE, BUT WHAT IF IT WAS A COSTLY CAMERA OR LAPTOP, IT WOULD HAVE GONE FOR EVER :(. PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR DELIVERING SERVICE FLIPKART."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"PROS:

Nokia Lumia 720,5,"RESPECTED CRITICS..
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN READING ALL THE REVIEWS YOU SENT. YOU KEPT ME IN A CONFUSED STATE FOR SO LONG. ALL THE CRITICISM ABOUT THE NEW OS AND PAID APPS KEPT ME AWAY FROM THIS HANDSET WHENEVER I WENT TO THE STORES WITH MULTIPLE BRANDS ALTHOUGH ITS LOOK ALWAYS ATTRACTED ME. LAST WEEK I FINALLY WENT WITH AN INTENT TO DECIDE WHAT WILL I GO FOR. FORTUNATELY I ASKED FOR THE LUMIA BENEFITS TO THE SALESMAN WHO ALONG WITH ALL THE AMAZING HARDWARE SPECS TOLD ME ABT THE 1.5 LACS FREE APPS WHICH WILL INCREASE IN NEAR FUTURE. AND EVEN THE PRICE HAS GONE DOWN TO 16999. SO ALONG WITH THE AMAZING BUILD QUALITY OF NOKIA, THE GLIMPSE OF AMAZING MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT CLEARED MY THOUGHT PROCESS. I AM SO HAPPY THAT I GOT A SOLID REASON TO NOT GO FOR THE CHEAP BUILT AND MOST COMMON SAMSUNG OR HTC.
      
      
      I M BUYING THIS WITH MY NEXT SALARY. :P"
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"SIMPLY AWESOME. THIS IS A VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT. ANDRIOD IS A OVERRATED CONCEPT. PEOPLE SHOULD USE WINDOWS PHONE AND THEN DECIDE AND I AM SURE THEY WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. JUST BECAUSE ANDROID IS FAMOUS, DOESN'T MEAN ITS THE BEST . FAMOUS TO POONAM PANDEY BHI  HAI :)."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"SINCE BUYING THE NOKIA LUMIA 720, THERE HAS BEEN A NOTICEABLE INCREASE IN MY STYLE QUOTIENT. INHERITING ALL THE ADVANTAGEOUS POINTS OF THE FAMOUS LUMIA SERIES, MY LUMIA 720 IS AN EYEBALL GRABBER FOR SURE, WITH ITS VIBRANT AND BRIGHT OUTER SHELLS. I CAN EVEN CHOOSE A WIRELESS CHARGING SHELL TO GET RID OF THAT MESSY CHARGER. THE SLIM UNIBODY DESIGN IS BEAUTIFUL. ON IT RESTS THE 4.3-INCH IPS TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY MADE FROM SCULPTED GLASS. IMBIBING CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION, IT HAS WEATHERED MY ROUGH HANDLING WITH EASE WITHOUT EVER SHOWING A SCRATCH.
      
      
      ENTERTAINMENT WISE, MY LUMIA 720 IS A CHAMP AS IT COMES WITH XBOX LIVE SUPPORT THAT LETS ME ENGAGE IN SOME OF THE BEST GAMING TITLES FOR THE MICROSOFT GAMING CONSOLE. WITH NOKIA MUSIC AND NOKIA MIX RADIO, I CAN LISTEN TO SOME OF THE BEST TRACKS OUT THERE IN THE MARKET. THE HD 6.7 MP REAR CAMERA IN COMBINATION WITH THE FRONT HD WIDE-ANGLED CAMERA DELIVERS STUNNING PHOTOGRAPHIC RESULTS. THE DIGITAL LENSES LIKE SMARTSHOOT, GLAM ME AND CINEMAGRAPH MAKE CLICKING PICTURES EVEN MORE FUN. I CAN EVEN RECORD 720P HD VIDEOS FROM MY LUMIA 720. THE HERE MAPS, DRIVE AND CITY LENS ARE HANDY APPS WHENEVER I AM TRAVELLING TO A NEW DESTINATION."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"SUCH A STYLISH PHONE FROM NOKIA.. FEELS PREMIUM WHEN YOU USE IT, TOUCH INTERFACE IS AWESOME. ITS LOT BETTER THAN NOKIA 520/620. JUST SPEND FEW MORE THOUSANDS AND AM SURE YOU WILL LOVE IT.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      YOU CANT REMOVE THE BATTERY. PHONE IS COMPLETELY SEALED. IF THE PHONE HANGS, YOU CANT REMOVE THE BATTERY AND RESTART IT. YOU NEED HOLD POWER + VOLUME + CAMERA BUTTON TO RESTART. IT HANGS VERY RARELY.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      SMOOTH INTERFACE
      
      FACEBOOK INTEGRATION( IT IS INTEGRATED WITH NOOK AND CORNER OF THE PHONE, U LL KNOW WHEN U USE IT)

Nokia Lumia 720,5,"THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I HAD ACCEPTED THAT THERE WAS NO BEATING SAMSUNG AT THEIR A GAME ? SMARTPHONES. BUT, I WAS FORCED TO RE-EVALUATE THIS BELIEF OF MINE AFTER THE LAUNCH OF THE LUMIA SERIES OF SMARTPHONES FROM NOKIA. NOW THAT I OWN A LUMIA 720 ALL FOR MYSELF, I HAVE COME TO ACCEPT THAT NOKIA IS SURPASSING SAMSUNG IN TERMS OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY.
      
      
      MY NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS A SLIM UNIBODY SLAB OF HIGH-TECH MACHINERY THAT CHURNS OUT INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE. ON THE OUTSIDE IT SPORTS A COLOURFUL AND VIBRANT SKIN, WHILE ON THE INSIDE IT HOUSES POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY LIKE THE DUAL-CORE 1 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR, 512 MB RAM AND AN ADRENO GPU. THIS POTENT COMBINATION POWERS ALL MY TASKS, BE IT APP EXECUTION, GAMING, MULTITASKING OR WEB BROWSING. THE S4 PROCESSOR ALSO PROVIDES BAFFLING BATTERY EFFICIENCY THAT IS A RARITY WHEN IT COMES TODAY?S SMARTPHONES.
      
      
      OVER THE POWERFUL HARDWARE BED, MY LUMIA 720 RUNS THE CUTTING-EDGE WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS SLOWLY BUT SURELY BECOMING THE CYNOSURE OF ALL EYES. AND, THERE ARE VALID REASONS FOR IT. MICROSOFT HAS CORRECTLY TAPPED THE END USER?S EXPECTATIONS AND DESIGNED AN OS THAT PROVIDES UNMATCHED CONVENIENCE AND SIMPLE NAVIGATION. I LOVE THE WAY ALL MY FREQUENTLY USED APPS RESIDE ON MY HOME SCREEN IN THE FORM OF TILES. WITH LIVE TILES, EVERYTHING IS UPDATED DYNAMICALLY AND I GET NOTIFICATIONS DIRECTLY. WITH THE INTEGRATED MS OFFICE SUPPORT, I CAN VIEW AND EDIT MS WORD, EXCEL AND POWERPOINT DOCUMENTS, WHILE ALSO MANAGING MY EMAIL ACCOUNT VIA OUTLOOK. I HAVEN?T SEEN THIS KIND OF DEEP EMBEDDED DOCUMENT EDITING SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER SMARTPHONE. I CAN EVEN SYNC THE DOCUMENTS TO MY PC.
      
      
      THE 6.7 MP REAR CAMERA OF MY LUMIA 720 IS A SURE CANDIDATE FOR THE BEST-IN-CLASS AWARD. IT COMES WITH A CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS AND IS SUPPLEMENTED BY AN LED FLASH. DIGITAL LENSES LIKE SMARTSHOOT WITH ERASE AND CINEMAGRAPH MAKE PHOTOGRAPHY TOTALLY ENJOYABLE. MY LUMIA 720 HAS A FRONT HD WIDE ANGLED CAMERA THAT IS IDEALLY SUITED FOR VIDEO CALLING AS WELL AS TAKING GUIDED GROUP SHOTS WITHOUT LEAVING ANYONE OUT. IT EVEN COMES WITH ITS OWN GLAM ME DIGITAL LENS. I CAN RECORD 720P VIDEOS FROM BOTH, THE FRONT AND REAR CAMERAS.
      
      
      MY NOKIA LUMIA 720 COMES WITH 8 GB OF ONBOARD MEMORY TO GO ALONG WITH 7 GB OF SKYDRIVE STORAGE. THE EXTENDED SUPPORT FOR MICROSD EXPANSION UP TO 64 GB IS IDEAL FOR A DATA HOARDER LIKE ME. I HAVE MY ENTIRE DATA AND MOVIE COLLECTION ON MY PHONE. THE 4.3-INCH IPS TOUCHSCREEN PANEL OF MY LUMIA 720 IS A BOON FOR GAMERS LIKE ME, AND THE INTEGRATED XBOX LIVE SUPPORT IS THE ICING ON THE CAKE. BESIDES THIS, THE SCREEN IS MADE FROM SCULPTED GLASS AND FEATURES CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION. IT COMES WITH TRUECOLOUR AND CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAKE ALL MY VISUALS COME TO LIFE WITH BRIGHTER COLOURS AND DEEPER CONTRASTS. VISIBILITY UNDER DIRECT SUNLIGHT IS ALSO MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER PHONES."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"THIS IS A COMPLETE MEAN MACHINE. MACHO, STYLED TO SUIT, THIS PHONE HAS WHAT EVER IT TAKE FOR A PHONE TO BE SMART. THE SPECIFICATIONS. THE EXPERIENCE, THE LOOKS, SIMPLY ASTONISHING. A MUST BUY IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THOSE NO-SO-SMART PHONES TO BUY IN THE SAME BUDGET."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW WITHOUT ANY BIASED, SINCE I HAVE SPENT 16K OF MY HARD EARN MONEY!
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS FOR THOSE WHO LOOKING FOR A TRUE COMMUNICATION DEVICE, NOT FOR THOSE WHO SELECT PHONE BASED ON #OF APPS IN THE APP STORE. BUT YES YOU WILL GET MORE THAN ENOUGH APPS U REQUIRED!
      
      
      KILLER APPS THAT CAN GIVE ANY APPLE &AMP; ANDROID PHONES RUN FOR THEIR MONEY:
      
      
      - PEOPLE HUB: SINGLE POINT WHERE YOU CAN COMMUNICATE USING FACEBOOK, EMAIL, SKYPE, CALL, SMS ETC, GET STATUS UPDATE. JUST AWESOME!
      
      
      - HERE DRIVE/HERE MAP/HERE CITY LENSES: KILLER APP THAT ANY DAY CAN CHALLENGE ANY NAVIGATION SW. MUCH CLEAR, ACCURATE THAN GOOGLE MAP, WITH GPS NAVIGATION!
      
      
      -LIVE TILES: PIN-UP YOUR FAVOURITE APPS, LIKE FB, PHOTO ETC ON HOME SCREEN AND KEEP GETTING LIVE UPDATES.
      
      
      -NOKIA MUSIC: UNLIMITED DOWNLOAD FOR 6 MONTHS.
      
      
      -SETTING, GIVES YOU ENOUGH CONTROL OVER YOUR PHONE TO CUSTOMIZE. BUT YES I GOT DISAPPOINTED WITH LIMITED CHOICE OF COLOUR THEMES. HOPE MICROSOFT WILL GIVE MORE CONTROL TO USER IN FUTURE VERSIONS.
      
      
      ITS NOT MESSY LIKE MOST ANDROID BASED PHONE. ITS CLEAN, FAST, FLUID WITH TIGHTLY INTEGRATED S/W &AMP; H/W. 1GHZ/500MB RAM MORE THAN ENOUGH TO DELIVER WHAT U WANT!
      
      
      -EXCELLENT CAMERA WITH CARL ZEISS LENSES, TAKES AWESOME PICS EVEN IN LOWLIGHT!
      
      
      -SUPER SENSITIVE GORILA GLASS, SCREEN WITH ENHANCED BLACK, EVEN EXCELLENT VISIBILITY IN DAYLIGHT.
      
      
      FINALLY NOKIA LUMIA IS LIKE RISE OF THE FONIX FROM THE ASHES OF SYMBIAN!
      
      
      VERDICT: JUST GO FOR IT IF YOU ARE LOOKING ANY PHONE BETWEEN 15-18K, YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT &AMP; WILL GET THE BEST PHONE EXPERIENCE TILL DATE...I HAVE USED BOTH APPLE AND ANDROID BUT NOKIA LUMIA SERIES IS JUST AWESOME!"
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"THIS IS THE BEST AVAILABLE PHONE UNDER 20K RANGE. I AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE BEST WINDOW'S PHONE... I AM SAYING THE BEST AMONG ALL AVAILABLE MOBILE OS : ANDROID, IOS, BADA, ETC.
      
      AND IN WINDOWS PHONE 8 OS, NO ONE CAN BEAT NOKIA. NOKIA... .. IS A TRUE CHAMPION.
      
      THE APPS DEVELOPED BY THE NOKIA'S DEVELOPER FOR WINDOWS 8 MOBILE PLATFORM ARE TRULY AMAZING. AND ICING ON THE CAKE, THE NOKIA FULLY RENOVATED MUSIC STORE, HERE MAPS AND ETC ETC.. FOR WINDOWS 8 PHONE.
      
      
      PROS : WELL EVERYONE HAS ALREADY MENTIONED EVERYTHING. SO, I WON'T MENTION THE SAME THING AGAIN. ITS AWESOME.
      
      
      CONS : YES, THE THING WHICH IRRITATES ME A LOT SPECIFICALLY IN 720 IS -
      
      ""BUZZ"" EFFECT : THE BUZZ EFFECT OR THE ""HAPTIC FEEDBACK"" FOR THE THREE CAPACITIVE BUTTONS - HOME, BACK AND SEARCH. TRUST ME.. ITS VERY ANNOYING, GIVES YOU THE FEELING OF A CHEAP PHONE, WHICH IT IS NOT.
      
      AFTER THE PURCHASE OF THIS, I THOUGHT I CAN DISABLE IT THROUGH THE PHONE SETTINGS. BUT, DIDN'T GET ANY OPTION FOR THAT. LATER, WINDOW'S DEVELOPER HAD MENTIONED THAT, THIS IS NOT THE WINDOWS OS PROBLEM. ITS SPECIFIC TO THE OEMS. OEMS ARE FREE TO MODIFY AS PER THEIR NEEDS. AND LATER IT GOT CONFIRMED, AS THIS BEHAVIOR YOU CAN'T FIND OR WILL BE VERY LESS IN LUMIA 820, 920 OR ABOVE MODELS.
      
      
      IF, NOKIA LL GIVE SOME UPDATE TO OVERCOME THIS, WILL BE APPRECIATED.
      
      BUT.. STILL THIS BUG/ISSUE WON'T STOP ME IN GIVING IT FULL 5 ;-). BECAUSE I LOVED IT."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"THIS IS THE BEST MID-RANGE WINDOWS PHONE YOU CAN BUY. IT IS A SORT OF MINI LUMIA 920. IT IS LIGHTER AND BETTER DESIGNED THAN 920. CAMERA PERFORMS VERY WELL, THE LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE IS BETTER THAN SOME ANDROID MOBILES WITH MORE THAN 8MP FROM INDIAN BRANDS LIKE MICROMAX AND KARBONN. YOU CAN BUY THIS SMARTPHONE FOR ITS CAMERA.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      512 MB RAM."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I EVER HAD !
      
      I AM REALLY LOVING IT...
      
      
      GORILLA GLASS TOUCH SCREEN IS SUPER SENSITIVE AND SCRATCH RESISTANT. I AM USING IT WITHOUT SCREENGUARD :)
      
      
      SCREEN CLARITY IS AWESOME EVEN WHEN VIEWING IN THE SUNLIGHT (THANKS TO CLEAR BLACK LCD DISPLAY)
      
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS TRADEMARK NOKIA STYLE ! :P (CAN EASILY USE IT FOR 2 DAYS WITH WIFI ON WITHOUT RECHARGING)
      
      
      WINDOWS 8 OS IS REALLY AS FAST AS THEY CLAIM IT IN ADS (TWICE FASTER THAN ALL ANDROIDS I'VE EVER USED)
      
      
      I GOT ALL THE APPS AND GAMES FROM WINDOWS STORE WHICH WE REQUIRE IN A PHONE
      
      
      YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ANY MUSIC FROM NOKIA STORE FREE OF CHARGE OR CAN EASILY TRANSFER VIA BLUETOOTH, PC (WITHOUT ZUNE)
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS REALLY SLIM AND LIGHTWEIGHT. MAYBE THE BEST LOOKING PHONE :)
      
      
      6.7MP CAMERA IS TOO GOOD ( CLARITY OF PHOTOS IN DAYLIGHT AND LOW LIGHT IS VERY VERY NICE. NO NEED TO OWN A DIGICAM)
      
      
      LIVE TILES ARE REALLY COOL AND THE PEOPLES APP IS MOST USEFUL FRO ANY USER. YOU CAN TWEET, SEND A MESSAGE THROUGH FACEBOOK, CALL OR SMS TO ANY PERSON BY A SINGLE TOUCH !
      
      
      HERE MAPS, HERE DRIVE AND HERE CITY LENS ARE REALLY USEFUL WHILE TRAVELLING. PROBABLY THE BEST !
      
      
      CONS (ACTUALLY THEY ARE IN OS SO I THINK THEY MIGHT VANISH IN OS UPDATE)
      
      
      IF YOU LOWER THE VOLUME WHILE LISTENING MUSIC, THE VOLUME LEVEL STAYS SAME FOR RINGTONES AND ALARMS (THIS IS PRETTY DUMB)
      
      
      NO SHORTCUTS FOR WIFI AND BLUETOOTH BY DEFAULT.
      
      
      MY PHONE WENT BLANK ONCE BUT I RESTARTED IT AND IT STARTED WORKING PROPERLY. I THINK MY PHONE HUNG (WHICH IS COMMON IN ANDROIDS :P). THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE TO MICROSOFT BUT IT HAPPENED ONLY ONCE.
      
      
      VERDICT :
      
      JUST GO FOR NOKIA LUMIA 720 AND YOU WON'T EVER REGRET ..."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"THIS IS THE BEST PHONE THAT I HAVE EVER USED.
      
      5 STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO RATE IT.
      
      TO START OFF, THE LOOK AND FEEL IS REALLY AWESOME AND IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE BORING ANDROID PHONES.
      
      THE CAMERA IS EXCELLENT AND LOW LIGHT IMAGING IS AWESOME.
      
      NOKIA HAS THE BEST CAMERA IN THE MARKET.
      
      REST OF THE APPS ARE ALSO GOOD. THIS PHONE IS PRETTY FAST IN RESPONDING.
      
      
      FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO DITCHED THIS PHONE SAYING THAT TEMPLE RUN WAS NOT AVAILABLE, WE HAVE THE ANSWER NOW. NOW THERE IS TEMPLE RUN FOR LUMIA 720.
      
      
      AT THIS RANGE, THIS IS THE BEST PHONE TO BUY."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BOUGHT A WINDOWS SMARTPHONE &AMP; IT IS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTING. THERE ARE A FEW FLAWS BUT SOFTWARE FLAWS CAN ALWAYS BE RECTIFIED. AS FOR THE BRAND, I HAVE ALWAYS TRUSTED NOKIA &AMP; WILL CONTINUE DOING SO. LET ME LIST OUT FEW OF THE PROS &AMP; CONS:
      
      PROS:
      
      1. FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE TAG(BOUGHT IT FOR 15.7K FROM FLIPKART),IT HAS ALMOST ALL THE FEATURES OF A SMARTPHONE.
      
      2. THE DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD &AMP; SO IS THE QUALITY(BOUGHT A WHITE ONE,LOOKS ROYAL)
      
      3. THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD BUT WONT SATISFY AN AUDIOPHILIAC.
      
      4. FOR A 6.7MP CAMERA,THE QUALITY OF THE PHOTOS IS VERY GOOD. ITS DEFINITELY NOT DISAPPOINTING.
      
      5. BOUGHT A 32GB SANDISK CLASS 10 SD CARD &AMP; IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. THE WINDOWS SOFTWARE IS STILL NOT PERFECT BUT NEITHER IS ANY NEW OS.
      
      2. LESS APPS,SOME ARE UNSTABLE TOO,BUT MS IS WORKING HARD ON IMPROVING THE APP STORE.
      
      3. NO OPTION FOR INSTALLING THE APPS ON SD CARD &AMP; WITH INTERNAL MEMORY OF ONLY 8GB, YOU CAN NOT INSTALL ALL THE APPS. HOWEVER,RECENTLY MS HAS LAUNCHED A STORAGE CHECK APP WHICH CLEANS SOME OF THE TEMPORARY FILES &AMP; IS WORKING ON PORTING THE APPS TO SD CARD.
      
      4. WHILE USING 3G,BATTERY DRAINS PRETTY QUICKLY,BUT THIS WILL MOST PROBABLY GET FIXED IN THE NEXT MAJOR UPDATE.
      
      
      CHECK OUT THE COMPLETE REVIEW ON PHONEARENA.COM,GSMARENA.COM. DESPITE THE FEW FLAWS, I AM VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH 720 &AMP; THE WINDOWS OS FEELS LIKE A PREMIUM AS THE MARKET IS ALREADY FILLED WITH ANDROID &AMP; APPLE SMARTPHONES. HOPE THIS REVIEW CLEARS SOME OF THE BASIC DOUBTS REGARDING THE LUMIA 720."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"TO CREATE A PLAYLIST., FIRST PLAY A SONG, THEN GO BACK TO ALBUMS OR SONGS, PRESS AND HOLD UR FAVORITE SONGS OR ALBUMS., U WILL GET OPTIONS AS ""ADD TO NOW PLAYING"" SELECT IT. LIKEWISE DO FOR ALL YOUR FAVORITE ALBUMS/SONGS. AFTER SELECTING, JUMP TO NOW PLAYING SONG., SELECT OPTION., U WILL SEE""SAVE AS PLAYLIST"". THATS IT., UR PLAYLIST IS SAVED.

      MANY FEATURES ARE HIDDEN IN WP. SO DONT BLAME THE OS. IF U DONT KNOW WHETHER A FEATURE IS AVAILABLE, GOOGLE IT.., U WILL FIND A SOLUTION."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"WAT SHALL I SAY ON THIS PHONE.... THIS IS THE BEST LUMIA MOBILE FROM NOKIA..... THE DESIGN,CAMERA AND I SHOULD NOT FORGET THE OS (WP8) TRULY STUNNING AND FANTASTIC. I GOT THE MOBILE FOR RS.15674 AND GOT THE MOBILE WITHIN 24HRS. A COMPLETE SALUTE FOR FLIPKART.
      
      NOKIA AND MICROSOFT U ROCK...."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"WELL, I AM A TECHIE AND A MOBILE ENTHUSIAST WHO HAS BEEN REVIEWING MOBILES AND OSES FOR QUITE A LONG TIME NOW.
      
      TECHNICAL ASPECTS ASIDE, THIS PHONE IS STILL GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY. IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, THE PRIMARY REASON WHY IS BECAUSE OF THE WINDOWS OS ""WHICH LACKS APPS"".
      
      TO BE HONEST, YOU DONT BUY A PHONE SO THAT YOU CAN USE APPS, YOU BUY A PHONE AND THEN LOOK IF THERE ARE GOOD APPS FOR IT. ALL THE BASIC NECESSARY ONES ARE ALL THERE. AND FOR A PERSON LIKE, IT MAKES NO SENSE TO BUY A PHONE BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS A LOT OF GAMES (MY DESKTOP SERVES THE SAME PURPOSE).
      
      COMING TO THE PROS AND CONS OF IT :-
      
      PROS
      
      1) SUNLIGHT READABILITY IS GREAT. AND GOOD PPI DENSITY OR NOT, TEXTS AND FONTS ARE CLEAR AND PLEASING TO THE EYES. EVEN MY GRANDMOTHER WITH LIMITED VISION FINDS IT VERY EASY TO HER EYES TO READ
      
      2) THE CURVED GLASS MAKES THE ENTIRE TOUCH EXPERIENCE HEAVENLY. IT SEEMS THE SCREEN FLOATS ON THE SURFACE!
      
      3) WINDOWS UI IS VERY SLICK AND FAST. I LOVE THE LIVE TILES AND SURFING THROUGH PAGES AND WINDOWS.
      
      4) BATTERY LIFE IS EXCELLENT FOR A BIG PHONE.
      
      5) LOUDSPEAKER IS BALLISTIC, HEADPHONES ARE DECENT AND THERE ARE EQUALISERS NATIVE TO THE PHONE. SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT AND BEATS BEATS AUDIO HANDS DOWN.
      
      6) CAMERA HAS AN ODD MEGAPIXEL FIGURE BUT REGARDLESS OF IT, IT CLICKS GREAT PICTURES. NO OTHER PHONE COMES CLOSE TO THAT QUALITY. THE CLOSEST IS SONY XPERIA S WHICH IS A GOOD 7K COSTLIER AND STILL LAGS IN LOW LIGHT IMAGING.
      
      7) ENTIRE MICROSOFT OFFICE SUITE IS FREE AND HANDY.
      
      
      CONS -
      
      NOT MANY CONS EXPERIENCED SO FAR, HOWEVER I GUESS OTHERS WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS PHONE SHOULD KNOW A FEW THINGS WHICH I THINK ONE MIGHT MISS OUT ON
      
      1) ACCESSORIES FOR LUMIAS ARE PRETTY COSTLY - FLIP COVER COSTS 500 BUCKS, A HARD CASE BACK COVER COSTS 500 BUCKS, SCREEN GUARDS ARE DOUBLE THE PRICE OF OTHERS.
      
      2) THE PHONE DOES NOT COME WITH A SCREEN GUARD IN-BOX.
      
      3) BLUETOOTH, WIFI AND OTHER THINGS CANNOT BE TOGGLED IN ONE SWITCH. YOU HAVE TO REACH TO THE SETTINGS MENU TO TURN THEM ON/OFF.
      
      4) KILLING TASKS AND APPLICATIONS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT - THE BACK BUTTON HAS TO BE DOUBLE TAPPED IN ORDER TO END THE TASK, ELSE IT REMAINS SUSPENDED IN THE BACKGROUND.
      
      
      BUT THESE NIGGLES ARE VERY SMALL FOR THE VALUE IT RETAINS AND STILL BY AND FAR IS THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY PHONE YOU CAN BUY IN THE PRICE RANGE. I AM CENT PERCENT SATISFIED WITH IT :-)"
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"WHAT DO U ACTUALLY EXPECT IN A PHONE PRICED AT 17K? THIS PHONE GOES BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE 2 MONTHS AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE. LETS GET DOWN TO THE DETAILS
      
      
      1) GOOD CALL QUALITY : NEEDLESS TO SAY, NOKIA HARDWARE HAS AND ALWAYS HAD GOOD SIGNAL RECEPTION AND CALL QUALITY. I HAVE USED A SONY ERICSSON XPERIA PHONE EARLIER AND THIS PHONE IS MUCH BETTER.
      
      
      2) CAMERA : CAMERA SENSOR IS GOOD CONSIDERING THE PRICE RANGE. IT TAKES GOOD PHOTOS IN WELL LIGHTED PLACES. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY, SHUTTER SPEED IS LESS, SO YOU WILL NEED TO KEEP THE CAMERA STILL LONGER TO GET GOOD PHOTOS. I HAVE COMPARED THE SAMSUNG S3 CAMERA, I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THIS CAMERA BEATS S3 HANDS DOWN. THE FRONT FACING CAMERA IS NOT BAD EITHER. MY FRIEND HAS A 28K HTC PHONE, THE FRONT FACING CAMERA IS NOT EVEN A GOOD AS THE THE 720'S FRONT CAMERA.
      
      THERE ARE SOME FILTERS FOR THE PHOTOS. YOU WILL USE THEM INTIALLY, AFTER THAT THEY ARE QUITE USELESS.
      
      
      3) BATTERY : BATTERY LASTS FOR 2 DAYS WITH NORMAL USAGE (3-4 CALLS DAY, GMAIL AND FACEBOOK USAGE FOR FEW MINUTES EACH, NEWSPAPER APPS FOR ABOUT 15 MIN IN THE MORNING, ALARM AND SOMETIMES YOUTUBE). IF YOU USE JUST FOR CALLS, IT COULD LAST FOR 4 DAYS.
      
      
      4) MUSIC : NOTHING EXTRA-ORDINARY WITH MUSIC, BUT IT MEETS EXPECTATION. IT HAS SOME SOUND ENHANCEMENTS FEATURES LIKE SURROUND SOUND WHICH DEFINITELY MAKES THE SOUND BETTER WHILE USING EAR PHONES OR WHEN CONNECTED TO BIGGER SPEAKERS.
      
      
      5) MAPS : YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MAP DATA AND USE WITHOUT DATA CONNECTION. THIS IS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE OVER GOOGLE MAPS ON ANDROID PHONES. THE OTHER ADVANTAGE IS YOU CAN SELECT THE ACCENT OF THE VOICE THAT GUIDES NAVIGATION AND UK ACCENT IS BETTER UNDERSTANDABLE FOR US. WITH GOOGLE MAPS, YOU ARE FORCED TO USE US ACCENT WHICH I FOUND COMPARITIVELY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. I FEEL NOKIA MAPS ARE BETTER IN TERMS OF USABILITY, BUT THIS MIGHT BE SUBJECTIVE.
      
      
      6) RAM AND PROCESSOR : SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED SEEING 512 MB RAM. BUT WINDOWS OS IS OPTIMIZED ENOUGH AND I DON'T SEE ANY LAGS EVEN WHEN USING MULTIPLE APPS TOGETHER. A FRIEND SHOWED ME HIS SAMSUNG S3 MEMORY USAGE, WHICH SHOWED AROUND 850MB OF THE TOTAL 1 GB RAM BEING USED BY BACKGROUND PROCESSES ALONE AND THERE WAS NO EASY TO BLOCK THESE PROCESSES, YOU JUST HAVE TO KILL THEM PERIODICALLY. IN WINDOWS, YOU CAN GO TO THE SETTINGS AND JUST BLOCK APPS FROM RUNNING IN BACKGROUND.
      
      
      7)  RESOLUTION &AMP; CLEAR BLACK DISPLAY : AT 217 PIXELS PER INCH, THE PIXEL DENSITY IS COMPARITIVELY LESS. BUT WHILE VIEWING THE VIDEOS AND PHOTOS, NO WHERE WILL YOU FEEL LET DOWN. INFACT I HAVE AN IPOD TOUCH WHOSE RESOLUTION IS HIGHER, BUT VIDEO AND IMAGE CLARITY SEEMS TO BE BETTER IN NOKIA LUMIA 720. CLEAR BLACK DEFINITELY INCREASES THE CONTRAST AND MAKES THE DISPLAY CRISP AND CLEAR.
      
      
      8) TOUCH SENSITIVITY: GREAT SENSITIVITY. INFACT WITH 'NORMAL' SENSITIVITY ITSELF, THE PHONE IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. WITH 'HIGH' SENSITIVITY YOU CAN TOUCH WITH GLOVES ON.
      
      
      9) OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPS : WINDOWS 8 OS IS THE BEST MOBILE OS AROUND AND THERE CAN BE NO DISPUTE ABOUT THIS. UNLESS YOU USE IT, YOU CAN'T APPRECIATE HOW SMOOTH AND RESPONSIVE THE UI IS. ALSO, THE OS UNLIKE ANDROID IS NOT CENTERED AROUND INDIVIDUAL APPS WHICH ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER AND HAVE THEIR OWN THEME. WINDOWS HAS ONE THEME CUTTING ACROSS APPS. SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES LIKE FACEBOOK ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE OS, MAKING FACEBOOK ACCESS AND UPDATES VERY QUICK. YOUR  MESSAGE, GMAIL, HOTMAIL INBOXES ALL HAVE THE SAME THEME. HOWEVER I MUST SAY THIS, SOME APPS ON THE ANDROID ARE STILL NOT AVAILABLE ON WINDOWS. I MISS PLAYERPRO MUSIC PLAYER FROM MY EARLIER ANDROID PHONE VERY MUCH. BUT MOST OF THE APPS THAT YOU REALLY NEED ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE IN WINDOWS.
      
      
      10) LOOKS : LOOKS ARE STUNNING, ESP THE BLACK ONE. PHONE IS LIGHT WEIGHT. INFACT SOME FRIENDS WHO OWN COSTLY SAMSUNG PHONES (READ AS S3 AND NOTE) WERE SURPRISED WHEN THE HEARD THE PRICE OF THE PHONE.
      
      
      NEGATIVES
      
      1) DOESN'T SUPPORT LINUX OS. SO YOU CAN'T COPY FILES FROM LINUX.
      
      2) APPS. ALTHOUGH NOT A SERIOUS LIMITATION ANYMORE AS MOST OF THE IMPORTANT APPS ARE AVAILABLE, THE FACT THAT MANY APPS ON ANDROID ARE STILL NOT AVAILABLE IS A LIMITATION."
Nokia Lumia 720,5,"WRITING AFTER 15 DAYS HANDLING THE PHONE. SHIFTED FROM SAMSUNG( PLASTICSUNG !) S DUOS.
      
      FIRST OF ALL NO SPECS NO PROS NO CONS.. WE ALL KNOW THAT. JUST A BIT OF MY EXPERIENCES WITH NOKIA LUMIA THE MOST AMAZING SMARTPHONE EVER.
      
      *USER INTERFACE IS REALLY A BREEZE FROM THE BORING ANDROID/IOS. LIVE TILES ARE REALLY AMAZING. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CREATION THESE ARE.
      
      THE PHONE IS VERY SMOOTH, NO LAGS LIKE THE LAGDROIDS ONE ( EVEN I HAVE SEEN THE SSG SIII ALSO LAGS SOMETIME.), TEMPLE RUN RUNS PRETTY SMOOTH. THE ANGRY BIRDS SHOULD BE FREE IN THIS PLATFORM.
      
      *BATTERY LIFE IS SIMPLY SUPERB. ON MOD TO HEAVY USES IT LASTED MORE THAN 30 HOURS FOR ME.
      
      *SCREEN IS REALLY SCRATCH RESISTANT WITH PROBABLY THE SMOOTHEST TOUCH IN THE WORLD.
      
      *THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF THE NOKIA LUMIA IS THE HERE MAPS AND  HERE DRIVE AND HERE CITY LENS. I THINK IT IS THE WORLDS BEST OFFLINE MAPS AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM. BELIEVE ME OR NOT I JUST CAUGHT MY TAXI DRIVER CHEATING AND SHOWED HIM THE SHORTEST DRIVEWAY.
      
      
      AND SOME MYTHS...........
      
      1) FILE MANAGER-  TO SOME POEPLE IT IS THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK. BUT THE REASON MICROSOFT DIDNT PUT THE PROVISION OF FILE MANAGER IS THEY WANT TO MAKE THE OS ROCKSOLID AND TAMPERPROOF AND OBVIOUSLY PIRACY FREE. C'MMON GUYS WHY DO WE NEED A FILE MANAGER EXCEPT TO INSTALL SOME PIRATED APPS ???? TO HAVE ACCESS TO OUR SONGS,MOVIES,VIDEOS,PICTURES .. RIGHT ???? WELL YOU CAN MANAGE ALL THOSE THINGS IN THIS OS PRETTY WELL WITHOUT A FILE MANAGER.
      
      2) ANTIVIRUS AND FIREWALL- NO YOU DONT NEED THAT. BECAUSE MICROSOFT SCREENS THE APPS BEFORE PERMITTING THEM IN THE STORE AND ALL THE APPS ARE SANDBOXED IN THE OS. THEY CAN;T INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. SO DNT WORRY ABOUT ANY VIRAL MALFUNCTIONING. AND AGAIN THIS IS A ADVANTAGE OF NOT HAVING A FILE MANAGER.
      
      3) APPS- THERE ARE ALL THE  APPS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKER WHICH ARE NECESSARY DAILY. DONT CRY FOR APPS.I WONDER HOW MANY APPS A PEOPLE NEED IN HIS DAILY MOBILE EXPERIENCE ????  1000000 ???? THATS INSANE MAN !!!!!
      
      4) GUYS PLEASE DONT CRY FOR EXTRA RAM. YOU WONT BE SATISFIED WITH ANY AMOUNT OF RAMS AND CPU CORES. HAD IT BEEN RELEASED WITH 1GB RAM I AM SURE PEOPLE WOULD SCREAM THAT 720, 820, 920 ALL HAVE 1 GB RAM WITH DIFFRENT PRICE TAGS AND NOKIA HAD GONE CRAZYY ETC BLAH BLAH...... IF YOU WANT 1GB RAM THEN DONT BUY 720. COUGH OUT EXTRA BUCKS AND BUY 820 BUT DONT CRY FOR 1 GB IN 720.
      
      **REMEMBER GUYS ONCE UPON A TIME NOKIA WAS THE ONLY COMPANY TO PRODUCE ANY SMARTPHONES.EVERY PHONE NOKIA MANUFACTURED IS A MASTERPIECE. GUYS CAN YOU NAME 5 PHONES OF SAMSUNG/SONY/HTC FROM PAST 10 YEARS ??? ANS IS NO. BUT EVEN THE GREATEST NOKIA HATER WILL ALSO NAME 10 NOKIA MASTERPIECE FROM LAST 10 YEARS.
      
      IF YOU CANT BE LOYAL TO ONE COMAPANY THEN AT LEAST PAY RESPECT TO THE PAST SERVICES RENDERED.
      
      NO BODY IS FORCING YOU TO BUY A NOKIA. ITS YOUR CHOICE. BUT DONT BLAME IT.
      
      5) LASTLY SOME ARE WRITING THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS BUT BLAMING THE COMPANY.I CANT UNDERSTAND WHY ARE THEY DOING SO ????
      
      ANY ELECTRONIC GOODS CAN BECOME FAULTY. THATS WHY COMPANY ARE GIVING MANUFACTURING WARRANTY. ITS COMPLETELY YOUR BADLUCK TO GET A FAULTY PIECE. I HAVE SEEN HTC ONE TO BECOME DEAD WITHIN A WEEK.
      
      
      FINAL WORDS--FLIPKART SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF 6 OUT OF 5.(LOL) TO ME ITS THE MOST AMAZING SMARTPHONE EVER IN THIS WORLD TILL DATE. I OWN THE WORLD'S GREATEST CAMERA PHONE NOKIA 808 PUREVIEW. AND NOW I OWN THE GREATEST SMARTPHONE IN THE WORLD. I WISH I HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY THE NOKIA LUMIA 920. :-(
      
      AND FOR THE OTHER  GUYS - PLEASE DONT BLAME THIS BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED MASTERPIECE. USE IT AND YOU WILL DEFINITELY LOVE IT.
      
      (PS- I THINK IT PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT I AM A DIE HARD NOKIAN. :P )"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"A FIRST FOR ME, FLIPKART GOOFED UP MY ORDER FOR THE LUMIA 720.  SEEMS THEY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE COURIER GUYS.  MY ORDER REMAINED UNTRACEABLE FOR 4-5 DAYS, BEFORE I ESCALATED.  AFTER ESCALATION, THE PRODUCT REACHED ME THE NEXT DAY.
      
      
      AS FOR THE PHONE, AM QUITE HAPPY WITH IT.  LOOKS GOOD FOR A BUDGET PHONE FOR MY PURPOSE (EMAILS, SOCIAL NETWORK AND BROWSING).  MY 7 YEAR OLD SON THOUGH, COMPLAINS ABOUT THE LACK OF GAMES."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"AFTER HAVING USED AN ANDROID PHONE FOR 2 YEARS, WHEN I DECIDED TO BUY A NEW PHONE FOR MYSELF, ALL THE PHONES IN THE ANDROID SECTION APPEARED MORE OR LESS THE SAME.....NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY WELL DESIGNED IN THE AREA OF LOOKS, BUT IS ALSO EXTREMELY SLIM........ APPLICATIONS LIKE, NOKIA GLAM ME AND SMART SHOOT ENHANCE THE CAMERA EXPERIENCE....THERE IS ALMOST NO WAY A PERSON CAN GET BORED WITH THIS PHONE.....INTERFACE IS PRETTY EASY....THOUGH WHATAPP NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED FOR WINDOWS 8, MEANWHILE, THAT CAN BE A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC. ALSO, IF YOU SWITCH THE PHONE OFF AND CHARGE IT, IT SWITCHES BACK ON.....THE PHONE IS PRETTY FAST BUT THE EARPHONES ARE NOT UPTO THE MARK. (NO BUTTONS FR ANSWERING OR DISCONNECTING A CALL ARE PROVIDED)"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"AT FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANKS FLIPKART FOR THERE PROMPT DELIVERY AND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE,TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN IT .I HAD ORDERED THE SAME PHONE ON A WEBSITE CALLED SNAPDEAL BUT THEIR CUSTOMER CALL CENTER SERVICE WAS PATHETIC AND  PRODUCT WASN'T SHIPPED WITHIN ESTIMATED SHIPMENT DATE,I HAD TO CALL 5-6 TIMES TO CANCEL MY ORDER
      
      LATER I PURCHASED THIS PHONE IN FLIPKART FOR 17,198,EVEN THOUGH I PAID LIKE 200 RS MORE THAN THAT SNAP DEAL I COULD TRUST FLIPKART!!!!!!
      
      HARDWARE
      
      BEST LOOKING PHONE WITH GREAT DISPLAY CALLED CLEAR BLACK DISPLAY
      
      AWESOME FEEL WHILE YOU HOLD IT
      
      YOU NEED NOT GET A CASE BECAUSE THE BUILD QUALITY IS NOT AS CHEAP AS SAMSUNG GRAND/QUATTRO.
      
      YOU CAN MAKE OUT THAT UNIBODY STRUCTURE MAKES THIS PHONE LIGHT.
      
      PHYSICAL BUTTONS ARE GREAT.
      
      DON'T GO BY 217PPI SPECS JUST USE THIS PHONE YOU CAN MAKE OUT WHY THIS DISPLAY IS BETTER.
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD.CARL ZEISS LENS HELPS YOU TAKE GREAT PICTURES.
      
      512MB RAM IS SUFICIENT,REMEMBER IPHONE 4S HAS SAME 512MB RAM. WINDOWS UNLIKE ANDROID IS NOT HARDWARE HUNGRY.
      
      SOFTWARE
      
      WINDOWS PHONE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SMOOTH SO FAR.
      
      VERY MINOR LAG SEEN HARDLY A SEC OR 2.,CAN BEAR WITH IT.
      
      APPS-IT HAS ALL THE APPS YOU NEED AND YOU USE IN REAL LIFE .I AGREE WHATSAPP HAS SOME ISSUES BUT WECHAT IN WINDOWS IS BETTER,IT HAS AWESOME INTERFACE
      
      THIS PHONE IS FOR A LIGHT GAMER AND FOR A PERSON WHO WANTS TO USE SMARTPHONE NOT A GAMING DEVICE WHICH DRAINS BATTERY.
      
      BATTERY FOR NORMAL  USAGE COMES FOR 1.5 DAYS ,WITH NORMAL I MEAN 1.5 HRS-CALL, 1HR-WIFI,1.5 HR-3G
      
      ITS ABOVE AVERAGE.
      
      MUSIC PLAYER OPTIONS ARE VERY LIMITED.
      
      FREE NOKIA MUSIC DOWNLOADS ARE AMAZINGLY FAST
      
      NOKIA OFFLINE MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE BETA AMAZES YOU .
      
      CONCLUSION
      
      ITS FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT WHEN THEY TAKE OUT THERE SMARTPHONE,NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE ENORMOUSLY HUGE PHONE WHICH DRAINS BATTERY AND WOULD LIKE TO SHOW OFF WITH 100 OF APPS WHICH THEY HARDLY USE"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"BEFORE U READ MY OPINION ABOUT THIS PHONE LET ME SHARE THAT I AM ALREADY A USER OF THIS PHONE LUMIA 720 SINCE ONE WEEK. AND I AM A TECH SAVVY.
      
      
      THIS PHONE NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS FAR FAR BETTER THAN ANY ANDROID.
      
      EXCEPT FOR A FEW THINGS :
      
      1) YOU CANNOT VIEW THE FOLDERS FROM UR EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD. U NEVER COME TO KNOW WHAT IS WHERE IN UR PHONE WHETHER IN PHONE MEMORY OR SD CARD MEMORY
      
      WHATEVER DATA U RECEIVE THRU BLUETOOTH THAT ALSO U NEVER KNOW WHERE IT GOES.
      
      2) THERE'S NO CALL RECORDER FACILITY AVAILABLE IN ANY WINDOWS PHONE, AND JUST FORGET AUTO CALL RECORDING.
      
      BUT THE WORST OF ALL IS THAT NO CALL RECORDING SOFTWARE OR APP HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY MICROSOFT FOR THEIR SO CALLED BEST OS WINDOWS 8. NO CALL RECORDING APP AVAILABLE THRU NOKIA STORE.
      
      I ENQUIRED WITH THE EXPERTS AND NONE HAD THE ANSWER.
      
      3) APPLICATIONS THAT U DOWNLOAD GET STORED ONLY ON THE MASS MEMORY (IE; INTERNAL MEMORY). LACS OF APPS AVAILABLE AND U CANT STORE ON SD CARD WHAT'S THE FUN ? 8 GB IS JUST NOTHING. MINE WAS FULL IN JUST 3 DAYS.  WHATS THE USE OF EXPANDABLE 64 GB ?
      
      THOSE WHO DONT FIND THESE FACTORS MORE IMP CAN GO FOR ONE.
      
      IF SOMEONE HAS THE ANSWER TO ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS PLS FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME ON VIVEKPKAPOTE@GMAIL.COM OR WRITE UR FEEDBACK ON FLIPCART.
      
      I HAVE RETURNED MY LUMIA 720 JUST TODAY AND IT WAS ACCEPTED BACK BY THE NOKIA PRIORITY DEALER. BUT IF SOMEONE HAS THE ANSWER TO MY REQUIREMENTS THEN I SHALL BUY AGAIN, TRUST ME."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"BOUGHT IT FROM CHANDIGARH @ 16900/- WITH BILL &AMP; WARRANTY, YELLOW COLOR WAS HARD TO FIND BUT I GOT THIS FROM SEC 22 CHANDIGARH AFTER CHECKING 3 SHOPS. OTHERWISE IN MUMBAI &AMP; DELHI THE PRICING IS CLOSE TO FLIPKART'S PRICING...."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR JUST THE LOOKS AND OS - BEST LOOKING WINDOWS PHONE IN MARKET ( MAYBE TILL LUMIA 925 IS RELEASED IN INDIA )
      
      WANTED TO TRY WINDOWS PHONE OS FOR QUITE SOME TIME, FOUND IT TO BE BETWEEN IOS AND ANDROID IN USER FRIENDLINESS (WITH IOS BEING MOST USER FRIENDLY)
      
      MISSED SOME FEATURES FROM ANDROID LIKE TOGGLE BUTTONS FOR BLUETOOTH, GPS, DATA TRANSFER ETC..
      
      WINDOW OS HAS A FRESH FEEL TO IT.
      
      LUMIA 720 WITH PUREBLACK DISPLAY FROM NOKIA LOOKS REALLY COOL?. BRIGHT SCREEN, THE LOWER RESOLUTION(WVGA) IS NOT AT ALL NOTICEABLE(MOSTLY TO DO WITH OS I THINK), OVERALL, FOUND THE DISPLAY TO BE REALLY NICE :)
      
      BUILD QUALITY IS EXCELLENT ? COMPARED TO THE SOME PLASTIC PHONES, THIS FEELS PREMIUM FINISH. CAMERA IS GOOD, MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS ADVERTISED AND HYPED, BUT GOOD.
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS SURPRISINGLY GOOD.
      
      
      CONCLUSION : VALUE FOR MONEY, THE BEST PHONE FOR USERS WHO ARE NEW TO TOUCH BASED PHONES AND WANT A SAFE BET WITH ?OLD AND TRUSTED NOKIA?
      
      AS ALWAYS FLIPKART IS EXCELLENT IN DELIVERY AND SERVICE .... LOVE THE TRACKING SYSTEM UPDATES. THANK YOU - ***** 5 STARS ***** FOR FLIPKART"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"CAN ANYBODY TELL ME DOES NOKIA LUMIA 520, 620 &AMP; 720 SUPPORTS BLUETOOTH FOR TRANSFERRING FILES SUCH AS MSGS, PICS, MEDIA FILES ETC... MY FRIENDS TOLD ME THAT FEW LUMIA DEVICES CAN ONLY TRANSFER MESSAGES AND CONTACTS..
      
      SINCE ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE ANDROID FREAKS SO I WANT MYSELF DIFFERENT STAND...
      
      SO GUYS PLZ HELP ME N MY BUDGET IS 13K TO 15K.."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"CONS:
      
      1. NOT ENOUGH APPS ON APP STORE. YOU'LL FIND THE LACK OF APPS FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES.
      
      2. NO FILE MANAGER.
      
      3. MUSIC APP UI IS NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY.
      
      4. WHATSAPP UI IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PLATFORM. AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY. THIS NEEDS A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT.
      
      5. YOUR FRIENDS WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU FOR BUYING A WINDOWS PRODUCT THAT DOES NOT HAVE CTRL+ALT+DEL KEYS. (ALTHOUGH THE DEVICE NEVER FREEZES)
      
      6. NOT MANY GAMES (NOT AN ISSUE FOR ME THOUGH)
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. SUPERB UI. LIVE TILES ARE GREAT!
      
      2. SMOOTH, FAST AND NEVER LAGS
      
      3. VIDEO AND SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT!
      
      4. HERE MAPS ARE AMAZING AND VERY ACCURATE.
      
      5. WP8 UI IS EXTENDED TO ALL APPS, MAKES THE APP EXPERIENCE SOOTH AS BUTTER AND TASTY TOO!
      
      6. GREAT CAMERA, SUPER PICS, NO SHUTTER LAG
      
      7. NOKIA MUSIC IS A BOON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PIRATE ANYMORE.
      
      8. BEST OFFICE EXPERIENCE EVER!
      
      
      TAKES A LITTLE GETTING USED TO, BUT ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT! I AM SATISFIED WITH THE TRANSITION FROM ANDROID TO WINDOWS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"DELIVERY OF THE PHONE WAS BEFORE THE EXPECTED DATE... FLIPKART ROCKS IN THAT.
      
      THE PHONE ..... ITS NOKIA ... SO IT CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED.
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY OF THE PHONE IS GREAT... ITS SLEEK, STYLISH AND THE GORILLA GLASS 2 MAKES THIS PHONE A PIECE OF ART.... THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE IS BETTER THAN ANDROID PHONES HAVING 512 MB RAM BUT IT WOULD HAVE ROCKED WITH A 1 GB RAM.... STILL YOU WOULDN'T FACE ANY PERFORMANCE ISSUES COZ IT STILL RUNS HEAVY GAMES, HD VIDEOS LIKE ANYTHING...
      
      
      COMING TO THE WIN8 OS.. THE INTERFACE IS SIMPLE...WITH GREAT SECURITY... YOU CANT INSTALL PIRATED APPS AND GAMES...YOU DON'T HAVE A FILE MANAGER... AND ONLY THE MEDIA FILES LIKE PHOTOS, VIDEOS AND MUSIC CAN BE STORED IN SD CARD... REST EVERYTHING IN PHONE MEMORY... SO YOU'LL HAVE TO CHOOSE WISELY BETWEEN HIGH MEMORY DEMANDING GAMES AND APPS
      
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS THE BEST IN ITS CLASS.... TAKES LOW LIGHT SNAPS VERY CLEARLY
      
      
      SOUND THROUGH SPEAKER IS ENOUGH... AND WITH HEADPHONES--- YOU WILL EXPERIENCE DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND WHICH IS AWESOME...
      
      
      OVERALL ITS A VERY NICE PHONE.... WORTH ITS PRICE....
      
      
      OVERALL RATING  =  4.5 / 5"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"EXPERIENCE WITH WINDOWS OS IS NICE.
      
      BUT STILL I FACED SOME PROBLEMS OF WHICH I AM MENTIONING SOME HERE
      
      1. SUDDENLY PHONE GOES INTO DEAD STATE WHERE YOU CAN?T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT RESTARTING (USE VOLUME DOWN + LOCK KEY). I FACED THIS WITHIN A WEEK OF PURCHASE.
      
      2. I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I CAME TO KNOW THAT I CAN'T SEE CALL DURATION IN THE CALL HISTORY.
      
      3. FELT VERY BAD THAT I AM UNABLE TO PLAY TEMPLE RUN.
      
      4. AVAILABILITY OF APPS IS LESS COMPARED TO ANDROID."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"FANTASTIC MOBILE..BROUGHT 10 DAYS BACK....BATTERY BACK UP IS SUPERB..SUPER SLIM..REALLY LOVED IT...
      
      I HAD A FEW PRBLMS.. IN D 1ST 2 DAYS PH BECAME DEAD..N BATTERY DRAINED..NOW WORKING FINE...IM USING..32GB MSD.."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"FIRST OF ALL.... THIS IS NOT ANDRIOD... SO ALL YOU ANDRIOD FREAKS THIS IS NOT FOR U PEPL. SECONDLY IT IS BEST OF ITS CLASS.
      
      WOULD NOT LIKE TO COMPARE IT WITH ANDRIOD, BUT IF U JUST WANT A KILLER SMARTPHONE GO FOR IT.
      
      AMAZING CAMERA, SMOOTH AS ICECREAM. THATS WHAT U CAN DEFINE IT.
      
      GREAT DELIVERY BY FLIPKART."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"FIRST THINGS FIRST... 10/10 TO FLIPKART FAST SERVICE AND QUICK DELIVERY. ORDERED PHONE ON LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND HAD MY LUMIA IN MY HAND ON TUESDAY. FIRST SHOPPING EXPERIENCE WITH FLIPKART AND IT WAS AWESOME.
      
      
      TO BE HONEST MY REVIEW IS LITTLE BIASED TOWARDS NOKIA. I AM ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED GUYS WHO STILL MISS THEIR OLD NOKIA 3310S, 1108S, 6600S OR 5800S. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST ONE WEEK AND NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS AN AMAZING PHONE. IT LOOKS GREAT AND HAS JUST THE PERFECT SCREEN SIZE FOR ME UNLIKE THOSE BIG SAMSUNG GALAXY'S WHICH DON'T EVEN FIT IN MY JEANS POCKETS.  IT HAS ALMOST ALL THE THINGS I EXPECT FROM NOKIA. CRISP AND CLEAR CALL QUALITY, LONG BATTERY BACKUP, BRIGHT SCREEN AND SOLID BUILD QUALITY.
      
      MOST IMPRESSED BY THE CAMERA IN LUMIA 720. IT ANYTIME BEATS MY FRIEND'S IPHONE CAMERA AND TO SOME EXTENT MY OLD CANON DIGICAM TOO IN PICTURE QUALITY. IT GET ME BEST INDOOR AND OUTSIDE PHOTOS. AND LOW LIGHT IMAGES ARE REALLY CRISP.
      
      THIS IS MY FIRST SMARTPHONE SO I AM STILL GETTING USED TO TOO MANY FEATURES IN WINDOWS PHONE 8 AND I AM LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BY WINDOWS FOR THEIR LACK OF BASIC FEATURES. I IS NOT TOO ANNOYING ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT. THEY EVEN MISS FEW GREAT THINGS FROM OLD NOKIA'S SYMBIAN. I HAVE NEVER USED ANY OTHER SMART PHONE SO DON'T KNOW IF OTHER PHONE OS HAVE THESE FEATURES OR NOT.
      
      SPENT ONE WHOLE DAY WONDERING HOW TO CLOSE AN APP. IT DOESN'T HAVE A CLOSE OR EXIT OPTION. THOUGH FOUND IT LATER THAT BACK BUTTON USULAAY CLOSES THE APP.
      
      THEY DON'T EVEN PLACE A REGULAR DIALLER ON THE HOMESCREEN. I MEAN PHONE'S MOST IMPORTANT TASK IS TO MAKE CALLS AND IT IS A LITTLE ANNOYING THAT I HAVE TO MAKE TOO MANY NAVIGATIONS IN THE MENU JUST TO MAKE A CALL. STILL NOT ABLE TO FIND A CALL LOG/REGISTER IN THE PHONE CALL. DISAPPOINTED BY IE10 BROWSER TOO. JUST DON'T LIKE IT. HOPE THEY ADD GOOD BROWSERS LIKE OPERA OR CHROME SOMEDAY TO WINDOWS APP STORE. NOKIA/BING MAPS ARE ALSO NOT AS GOOD AS GOOGLE'S. WISH THEY MAKE MAPS FOR THIS LIKE THEY HAVE ADDED FOR IPHONE.
      
      APPS TOO ARE LIMITED. HOPE MICROSOFT FIXES SOME BASIC THINGS IN NEXT UPDATE.
      
      MY RATING 7/10.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. GREAT CALL QUALITY (MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR A PHONE IN MY OPINION)
      
      2. GREAT BATTERY BACKUP. WITH MODERATE TO HEAVY USAGE (1 HOUR GAMING, AROUND 50 MBS DOWNLOAD ON 2G, 2-3 HOURS CALLS, 3 HOURS OF MUSIC AND 1 HOUR OF VIDEO PLAYBACK ALSO BATTERY LASTS ALMOST 1.5 DAYS).
      
      3. AWESOME CAMERA
      
      4. SOLID BUILD
      
      5. SUPER SENSITIVE TOUCH SCREEN
      
      6. GREAT DAYLIGHT VISIBILITY OF SCREEN. RESOLUTION IS NOT MUCH BUT STILL LOOKS VERY GOOD.
      
      7. GREAT PERFORMANCE. NO LAG WITH MULTITASKING (SMOOTHLY RUNS 4-5 APPS TOGETHER).
      
      8. MICROSOFT'S OFFICE SUITE IS GREAT.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. RAM IS ONLY 512 MB. SHOULD BE A GIG FOR THIS PRICE POINT.
      
      2. MISSES SOME BASIC FEATURES WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE.
      
      3. NO FM
      
      4. HEADPHONES ARE VERY BASIC (SOME 2-3K MICROMAX PHONES COME WITH AMAZING HEADPHONES).
      
      5. FIRST DAY IT ANNOYED ME WITH MICRO-SIM. HAD TO WAIT ONE DAY TO GET MY SIM CUT. I DON'T KNOW WHY DON'T ALL THE PHONE MAKERS FOLLOW SAME STANDARDS.
      
      
      STILL IT IS A GREAT PHONE. I GIVE IT 7/10. GREAT BUY IF YOU DON'T TRUST ANY OTHER PHONE-MAKER WITH YOUR 18000 BUCKS LIKE ME."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE IN THE MARKET FOR A NEW PHONE WHICH IS REASONABLY PRICED (BETWEEN 15K TO 25K) LUMIA 720 IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST BET.
      
      
      LOOK AND FEEL : THIS IS THE BEST LOOKING PHONE AT ITS PRICE POINT AND LOOKS EXTREMELY WELL FINISHED. THE BACK DOES TAKE FINGERPRINT SMUDGING BUT THAT IS MINOR COMPARED TO THE OVERALL LOOK AND FEEL. THE UNIBODY WITH THE TAPERED GLASS FINISH GIVE IT A SOPHISTICATED LOOK AT PAR WITH SOME OF THE BEST IPHONES AND HTC ONE X.
      
      
      DISPLAY: 480 X 800 DISPLAY ON 4.3INCH SCREEN IS VERY CRISP. IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT IT IS VERY READABLE AND IN MY OPINION BETTER THAN SOME OF THE AMOLED SCREENS OF MORE EXPENSIVE PHONES. MY NOTE1 HAD A SCREEN THAT WAS BARELY READABLE IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. THIS ONE IS MANY TIME BETTER.
      
      
      INTERFACE: THE WINDOWS INTERFACE DOES TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO BUT IT IS FAIRLY INTUITIVE AND EFFECTIVELY FUNCTIONAL. LIVE TILES IS A GOOD IDEA BUT MORE 'LIVE' TILE OPTIONS ARE NEEDED AS NOT EVERY APP HAS A TILE THAT IS 'LIVE. RESPONSE TIME FOR MOST APPS IS FAIRLY GOOD AND BETTER THAN COMPARABLE ANDROID PHONES. I AM NOT SURE IF THIS WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS IN MY LAST ANDROID PHONE THE RESPONSE TIME DEGRADED CONSIDERABLY OVER 6 MONTHS OF USAGE (WITH SAMSUNG NOTE 1).
      
      
      CAMERA: NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS PHONE HAS ONE OF THE BEST CAMERAS AT PAR OR BETTER THAN PHONES OF A HIGHER PRICE RANGE. YOU CAN DO A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH AND CHECK COMPARISONS WITH IPHONE V, SAMSUNG S3 ETC. THIS IS A TERRIFIC CAMERA THAT IS AVAILABLE IN AN UNDER 20K PHONE. FREE APPS FROM NOKIA HELP YOU DO ALMOST ALL TYPES OF EDITING, FILTERS LIKE INSTAGRAM ETC.
      
      
      MAPS: I HAVE NOT EXPLORED THIS MUCH BUT SO FAR THE INBUILT NOKIA MAPS DO NOT SEEM AS GOOD AS THE DEFAULT GOOGLE MAPS. BUT REMEMBER, GOOGLE HAS BEEN MAKING MAPS AND IMPROVING THEM FOR OVER 10 YEARS. HERE MAPS BY NOKIA ARE FAIRLY RECENT AND I AM SURE OVER TIME, THEY WILL BECOME BETTER. I HAVE NOT TRIED THE FREE NAVIGATION YET BUT WILL DO SOON.
      
      
      BATTERY LIFE: WITH 2000MAH BATTERY, THIS PHONE SHOULD HAVE ONE OF THE BEST BATTERY LIFE IN COMPARISON TO ALL ITS PEERS. AGAIN, I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS SINCE I RECEIVED THE PHONE YESTERDAY ONLY. BUT SO FAR THE BATTERY LIFE LOOKS PROMISING.
      
      
      FINAL WORD: IT IS BIG CHANGE TO MOVE TO WP8 FROM ANDROID (LIKE ME) OR IOS. BUT AS THE SYSTEM EVOLVES, IT HOLDS THE PROMISE FOR A MUCH MORE REFINED INTERFACE, LONGER BATTERY LIFE AND THE RELIABLITY OF NOKIA. NOT TO MENTION ALL THE FREE EXCLUSIVE NOKIA APPS (LIKE NOKIA MUSIC) MAKE THIS A TRULY WORTHWHILE PHONE. I HAVE GIVEN IT 4 STARS AND NOT 5 AS THE INTERFACE NEEDS SOME MORE REFINEMENT BEFORE IT BECOMES BEST IN CLASS..!!
      
      
      FLIPKART: NEXT DAY DELIVERY... THAT ITSELF IS WORTH THE MONEY SPENT ON THIS WEBSITE..!! ALWAYS GREAT RELIABLE SERVICE..!! NEVER FAILS..!!"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"GOT MY LUMIA 720 YESTERDAY,WHICH IS GLOSSY WHITE.
      
      
      THE PHONE LOOKS VERY BEAUTIFUL.THE LOOK &AMP; FEEL IS BETTER THAN ANY OF THE ANDROID OR THE IPHONE AROUND. EVEN THIS ONE BEATS LUMIA 920 IN THE DESIGN ASPECTS.
      
      
      THE UI INTERFACE IS SUPER SMOOTH. THE APPS PROVIDED WITH THE PHONE IS ALSO COOL. CAN'T COMPLAIN ANYTHING WITH RESPECT TO THE DESIGN OR THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE PHONE. ONE DRAWBACK I FACED IS THE PHONE GOT RESTARTED TWICE,ONCE WHILE USING THE CITY LENS  &AMP; ONCE WHEN TRYING TO LOGIN TO NOKIA ACCOUNT. HOPE NOKIA WILL FIX THIS ISSUE IN THEIR UPCOMING SOFTWARE RELEASE."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"GOT THE PHONE 2 DAYS BACK .GREAT UI, TOUCH, CAMERA IS STUNNING. BUT I AM GETTING ISSUES IN NOKIA MUSIC SOFTWARE. WHEN THE SCREEN TIMES OUT OR I LOCK THE SCREEN (USING THE SIDE BUTTON), ONLINE MUSIC STOPS. DO ANYBODY KNOW WHY THIS IS HAPPENING"

      AS IT IS ONLY 6.7 MP IT SHOOTS QUITE AMAZING PICS....
      
      BUT I WAS UPSET WITH ONE THING THE BATTERY COMES ATTACHED WITH THIS PHONE AND IF THE PHONE HANGS U HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL YOUR WHOLE BATTERY DISCHARGE AND ITS SHUT DOWN BY ITS OWN THIS IS THE MAJOR DRAWBACK OF THIS PHONE I HAVE FOUND TILL THIS TIME..."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"GUYS, I BROUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART. THE FIRST EQUIPMENT I RECEIVED HAD SOME MANUFACTURING DEFECT. I APPRECIATE THE FLIPKART TEAM FOR THEY WERE ABLE TO QUICKLY REPLACE THE INSTRUMENT. I WILL SAY AMAZING SERVICE LEVELS FROM FLIPKART, BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS.
      
      
      COMING TO THE LUMIA 720 - ITS AMAZING.. I MOVED FROM BLACKBERRY (FOR THE OPERATING COSTS WERE HIGHER). COMPARING, BOTH BLACKBERRY AND LUMIA, HAVE THEIR OWN PROS AND CONS.. BUT ALL IN ALL, I HAVE BEGUN TO LOVE THE LUMIA AS I AM LEARNING ITS FEATURES, DAY BY DAY. HERE I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DEGRADE BLACKBERRY, ITS GOOD IN ITS OWN PLACE.

      6.IN-APP FEATURES: MOST OF THE IN-APP FEATURES ARE NOT INTUITIVE. IT WILL ANNOY NON-TECHNICAL USERS. EG: THERE IS NO SEARCH OPTION IN MESSAGES, NO PLAYLIST EDIT OPTION FOR MY MUSIC, ETC .... YOU CANNOT REPLACE THESE WITH MARKET APPS TOO .. (POINT 6) .. SO IT TAKES A BIT OF RESEARCH TO FIND OUT AND GET USED TO IT..

WELL, I WAS USING SAMSUNG WAVE 533 BEFORE THIS SO I HAVE ALL THE MORE REASONS TO LIKE MY NEW CELLPHONE. ONE THING, I RECHARGED IT COMPLETELY LAST NIGHT, DIDNT USE IT MUCH TODAY AND THE BATTERY GOT DRAINED. I HOPE THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH HAPPENS INITIALLY AND NOT IN FUTURE (AS I HAVE GREAT EXPECTATIONS FROM THIS PHONE). ONE QUES WHICH I HAVE IS THAT I WAS ABLE TO TRANSFER SOME 550 CONTACTS I HAVE ON MY OLD PHONE USING THE IN BUILT APP TRANSFER MY DATA.IT TOOK ME JUST 2 MINS.

Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT I HAVE A NOKIA LUMIA 720 MOBILE.
      
      IT?S A GREAT PHONE WITH VERY GOOD SPEED AND A WONDERFUL BATTERY LIFE. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN USING NOKIA AND RECENTLY I GOT A IPHONE (FOR SECOND NUMBER). MY EARLIER NOKIA WAS A C6 FLIP TYPE.
      
      I HAD BEEN FOLLOWING NOKIA AND WINDOWS PHONE EVER SINCE LUMIA WAS RELEASED AND WAS VERY HAPPY TO KNOW THE PROGRESS. I KEPT ON LOOKING FOR REVIEWS WHICH HELPED ME TO MAKE A DECISION.
      
      
      AS A PHONE 720 IS A GREAT ONE WITH WINDOWS8 ON IT. MOST OF THE COMMON APPS ARE EASILY AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AND THE DOWNLOAD SPEED IS TOO GOOD.
      
      1)	BATTERY IS VERY VERY GOOD *****
      
      2)	AWESOME TOUCH SCREEN *****
      
      3)	EASY TO WORK ON. INITIALLY A BIT TOUGH BUT SMOOTH AS YOU GO ON.
      
      4)	CAMERA ? IT?S A GOOD ONE BUT NOT TO MY EXPECTATION.***
      
      5)	NOT YET CHECKED THE FRONT CAMERA FOR VIDEO CALLS.
      
      6)	SPEED: VERY GOOD ****
      
      7)	DESIGN: TOO GOOD / SLEEK. BE CAREFUL IT MAY SLIP OF YOUR HAND.
      
      8)	AUDIO OUTPUT: AWESOME ****
      
      
      REGARDING FLIPCART AND THE SELLER:
      
      1)	VERY GOOD SERVICE
      
      2)	GOT THE PHONE IN 3DAYS
      
      3)	LUCKILY GOT A GREAT DEAL ON FLIPCART. I PAID 15.5K
      
      4)	2 OF MY FRIENDS BOOKED THE SAME PHONE ON FLIPCART AFTER ME."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,I AM REALLY SURPRISED THE WAY PEOPLE COMMENT HERE AND POST REVIEWS WHICH SHOW HOW MUCH IGNORANT THEY ARE. BTW I AM USING A HTC DESIRE V BUT THIS SAMSUNG DEVICE IS THE BEST  PHONE WITH ALMOST OK PRICE ONE CAN BUY
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER USING LUMIA 720 FOR 2 WEEKS. HERE I FURNISH WITH SOME IMPORTANT MOBILE USAGES.
      
      
      BATTERY: BATTERY IS GOOD COMPARE TO OTHER SMART PHONES. 1 DAY IS BACKING(USING OF FACEBOOK, GMAIL, YOUTUBE).
      
      
      WIFI: INTERNET IS VERY FAST. WITHIN IN 2 SEC I GET CONNECTED WITH MY NETWORK.
      
      
      3G: ITS BETTER TO USE WIFI, BCOZ AFTER USING OF 10 MINS PHONE IS HEAT IN THE BACK SIDE. EVEN THOUGH, I USE ONLY FACE-BOOK ITSELF.
      
      
      CAMERA: TAKING PICTURE AND VIDEO ARE VERY GOOD. NOKIA CAMERA IS ALWAYS GOOD.
      
      
      NOKIA MUSIC: IT IS NEW TO ME. INTERNET IS AVAILABLE MEANS, WE CAN DOWNLOAD SONG, LISTEN MUSIC ONLINE AND DOWNLOAD NEW SONGS FROM NOKIA MUSIC.
      
      
      APPS: LIKE OTHER MOBILE MARKET, VIBER, WECHAT, CRICKBUZZ, YOUTUBE DOWNLOAD....ETC ARE AVAILABLE.EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT RAM IN LUMIA 720, IN WINDOWS 8 APPS REQUIRED ONLY &LT; 10MB MEMORY. SO 512 RAM IS OK FOR APPLICATION TO RUN.
      
      
      OVERALL GOOD MOBILE FOR 16K-18K."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I BOUGHT  IT 2 MONTHS AGO. INITIAL DAYS WERE VERY GOOD DUE TO THE NEW TOUCH N FEEL OF WINDOWS OS( I WAS AN ANDROID USER BEFORE). AS DAYS PASS BY IN ONE WAY OF THE OTHER WILL DEFINATELY MISS ANDROIDS APP SUPPORT AS WELL AS THE CUSTOMIZING ABILITY OF ANDROID IN WHICH U CAN ABSOLUTELY CHANGE ANY THING. IN NOKIA ALL YOU CAN CHANGE IS THE LIMITED RANGE OF COLOURS OF THE LIVE TILES.
      
      THE BEST THINGS ABT THIS PHONE IS ITS BATTERY WHICH WILL EASILY LAST FOR 2 DAYS WITH MODERATE USE. I THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW GOOD THE CAMERA IS.THE OTHER BEST THING IN NOKIA IS THE NOKIA MAPS WHICH IS AMAZINGLY STUNNING. IF YOU TRAVEL A LOT , IM SURE YOU WOULD LOVE THIS. IT WORKS ACCURATELY WITHOUT GPRS (A GPS) AS WELL. IT HAS ITS PRO S AND CONS BUT A VERY VERY GOOD PHNE WITH VERY LIMITED APP SUPPORT AND ALMOST 0 CUSTOMIZABILITY . IF YOU ARE FROM ANDROID BACK GROUND LIKE ME . YOU WILL DEF MISS ANDROID"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I BOUGHT NEXUS 4 JUST A FEW DAYS AGO AND MY FRIEND BOUGHT A LUMIA 720 RED. I LOVE MY PHONE, BUT I ALSO LOVED HER PHONE! THE RED PHONE LOOKS AWESOME. THE DISPLAY QUALITY, THE SMOOTHNESS ALL IS AWESOME. BUT IT LACKS THE NUMBER OF APPS RIGHT NOW, WHICH MIGHT IMPROVE LATER. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PHONE UNDER 20K THEN THIS IS THE ONE TO TAKE."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE 2 WEEKS BEFORE SINCE THEN AM USING THE SAME
      
      
      1)TOUCH IS SUPERSENSITIVE BETTER THAN MOST OF THE FLAGSHIP PIECES  FROM MOST OF OTHER MANUFACTURERS
      
      
      2)BATTERY IS EXCELLENT,TO WHATEVER EXTENT U USE IT WILL FINISH A DAY WITH ATLEAST 30% CHARGE REMAINING. WITH MODERATE USE IT WILL COMPLETE 2 DAYS COMFORTABLY.
      
      
      3)CAMERA IS GOOD NOT SUPERB OR EXCELLENT AS MENTIONED IN SOME OF OTHER REVIEWS. I WILL GIVE A RATING OF 4/5
      
      
      4)DEVICE LOOKS PREMIUM, VIBRANT COLORS WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION
      
      
      5)HERE MAP AND HERE DRIVE WILL WORK WITHOUT DATA CONNECTION THAT'S REALLY GREAT. COMPARED TO GMAP IT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH DETAILS WHATEVER IS NECESSARY ITS THERE. IN THE DUE COURSE OF TIME THINGS MAY TURN AROUND. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL GMAP FROM STORE, IT WILL ALWAYS POP UP SOME ADS WHICH CAN BE IRKSOME.
      
      
      5)WINDOWS 8 OS IS REALLY GOOD, BUT IF U ARE USING FOR THE FIRST TIME U MAY NOT HAVE A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE, ESPECIALLY CREATING  PLAYLISTIN NOKIA MUSIC &AMP; VIDEO APP, MICROSOFT CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT THE PROCEDURE FOR MAKING THE PLAYLIST USER FRIENDLY. I WILL REALLY SAY IT AS A PROCEDURE.
      
      
      6)SINCE THE BODY IS MADE OF POLYCARBONATE MATERIAL, WITH LONG USE UNDERGROUND COLORS WILL NOT SURFACE BECAUSE THE MATERIAL IS HAVING THE SAME COLOR THROUGHOUT THE DEPTH
      
      
      7)GORILLA GLASS IS REALLY AN ADDED ADVANTAGE.
      
      
      8)MORE THAN SUFFICIENT AMOUNT APPS ARE THERE IN STORE
      
      
      9)YOU WILL GET 3 MONTHS BIGFLIX SUBSCRIPTION FREE WITH PURCHASE OF THIS MOBILE, EVENTHOUGH THEY SAME MORE THAN 1500 MOVIES I STILL FEELS THAT IT HAS ONLY VERY FEW MOVIES MOST OF WHICH U CAN SEE FROM YOU TUBE ITSELF.
      
      
      10)YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ANY SONG FROM NOKIA MUSIC FOR 1YEAR ABSOLUTELY FREE BUT I FEEL THAT SOUND CLARITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE MORE BETTER.
      
      
      11) MOST OF THE APPS WILL NOT RUN IN BACKGROUND, SAY SUPPOSE IF UR DOWNLOADING A SONG IF U PUT IT IN BACKGROUND IT WILL STOP DOWNLOADING. IF U WANT TO  RESUME THE DOWNLOAD U  HAVE TO BRING IT TO DESKTOP
      
      
      12) EAR PHONE THAT I RECEIVED WITH THIS WAS REALLY OF SUBSTANDARD QUALITY, NOW AM USING A JBL EARPHONE WITH WHICH SOUND CLARITY IS EXCELLENT, I SUGGEST EVERYONE TO PURCHASE A BETTER EARPHONE ALONG WITH DEVICE SO THAT U CAN ENJOY THE MUSIC TO THE FULLEST
      
      
      PRODUCT IS REALLY OF MORE WORTH THAN ITS PRICE!!!"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM A LOCAL NOKIA STORE THE VERY FIRST DAY OF ITS LAUNCH- 18TH. I WAS A BIT APPREHENSIVE TOWARDS A WINDOWS 8 PHONE BUT THE LOGICAL SENSE PREVAILED AND I BOUGHT THIS. ALL THE TECH SPECS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED IN OTHER REVIEWS SO ALL I CAN COMMENT UPON IS THE USER EXPERIENCE. THIS IS ONE BEAUTIFUL PHONE IN YOUR HAND. A HEAD TURNER. THE BUILD QUALITY IS AWESOME FAR BETTER THAT ANY SAMSUNG PHONE CAN GIVE YOU. GLASS IS AMAZINGLY AWESOME AND FEELS STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL AT THE VERY SAME TIME. PHONE IS WORKING EXCELLENTLY BUT THERE ARE A FEW HICCUPS TOO, LIKE  EMAILS UPDATING ARE GIVING SOME PROBLEMS AT TIMES , YOU CANNOT STORE NUMBERS ON SIM CARD BUT ONLY ON YOUR E MAIL ACCOUNT AND A FEW MORE WHICH ARE ACCEPTABLE AGAINST THE GOOD FEATURES OF PHONE.
      
      I AM USING A 16 GB CARD WHICH AT TIMES IS SLOW TO LOAD MAY BE BECAUSE OF A 512MB RAM AND THIS IS THE ONLY DRAWBACK IN PHONE I GUESS WHERE SOMETIMES IT GETS SLOW DUE TO LOW RAM BUT MIND YOU IT DOESNT HANG ONLY GETS SLOW.
      
      SO UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU DONT HAVE A SET OF APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID AND YOU ARE A GENERAL USER THEN SURELY GIVE THESE WINDOWS PHONE FROM NOKIA A DEFINITE TRY. EVERY GENERAL USER WILL LIKE IT .... LIKE IT BETTER THAN ANDROID FOR YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A BETTER PHONE WITH MORE BATTERY POWER...
      
      GO FOR LUMIA PHONES THEY ARE ACTUALLY BETTER THAN OTHERS."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I CHOSE NOKIA BECAUSE IT HAS UNMATCHED INBUILT FEATURES, SOLID HARDWARE AND COMES AT VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE.FREE MUSIC DOWNLOAD, INBUILT NAVIGATION, ACCESS TO MAP OFFLINE ARE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF NOKIA PHONE.
      
      I WOULD LIKE TO CREDIT MICROSOFT FOR THEIR METRO UI. IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND STANDS OUT FROM THE OTHERS IN THE MARKET. WP PACKAGED FEATURES ARE COMPARABLE TO WHAT GOOGLE OFFERS ON ANDROID PHONES.
      
      ON THE DOWN SIDE THERE ARE NOT A BILLION APPS ON WINDOWS MARKETPLACE UNLIKE ANDROID AND IOS PLATFORM, BUT HAS MOST OF THE IMPORTANT APPS YOU WILL NEED.
      
      FORM FACTOR AND FEEL IS GOOD. TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY SMOOTH AS WELL. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MEDIUM RANGE PHONE THIS IS A PERFECT CHOICE."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I GOT THIS PHONE TODAY. AND IT HAS ALREADY STARTED ME FEEL PROUD. THE SCREEN, THE TOUCH IS JUST AWESOME. DIDN'T GOT MUCH CHANCE YET TO TEST IT IN DEPTH AS I NEED A MICRO SIM BUT MY FIRST IMPRESSION IS WOW ! GUYS, KEEP ASIDE ITS LIMITATIONS. STEP AWAY FROM VERY COMMON ANDROIDS AND TRY THIS. AFTER ALL PHONE SHOULD BE MORE OF A STYLE STATEMENT AND LESS FOR GAMING. WILL POST MORE VERY SOON. AND, FLIPCART, AMAZING SERVICE. THEY DIDN'T DELIVERED MY OTHER ORDER YET THOUGH, A COVER FOR MY NEW PURCHASE."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I HAD BEEN COMPARING LUMIA 720 AND 820 FOR A WHILE AND CAME TO A CONCLUSION THAT APART FROM CERTAIN MINOR ASPECTS, THE LUMIA 720 BEATS 820. NOW, ONE SHOULD NOTE CERTAIN THINGS BEFORE BUYING THIS DEVICE.
      
      I)THE PHONE DOES NOT HAVE ANY INBUILT EFFECTS IN IT'S CAMERA LIKE BLACK AND WHITE OR SEPIA ETC. YOU WILL NEED TO DOWNLOAD AN APPLICATION FOR THAT.
      
      II)IF YOU'RE A GAMER AND LOOKING FOR FREE GAMES WITH HIGH GRAPHICS, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT MOST OF THE GOOD GAMES ARE VERY HEAVY AND WILL HAVE TO BE PURCHASED FROM THE STORE.
      
      III)ANDROID WILL BEAT WINDOWS PHONE IN THE APPLICATIONS DEPARTMENT. WINDOWS DOES LACK SOME GOOD APPS.
      
      IV)THE CAMERA IS GOOD INDEED, SPECIALLY UNDER AMPLE LIGHT, THE PHOTOS ARE EXCELLENT. LOW LIGHT IMAGING IS GOOD TOO, BUT USING FLASH UNDER LOW LIGHT MIGHT RESULT IN A GRAINY IMAGE.
      
      V)THERE IS NO FM RADIO.
      
      VI)THE NEW INTERNET SHARING FEATURE IS A GOOD FEATURE.
      
      VII) BATTERY LIFE IS EFFING AWESOME. BUT DON'T KEEP CHARGING IT EVERY TIME
      
      IF YOU'RE BUYING THE WHITE ONE, THEN MAKE SURE YOU BUY A BACK COVER, BECAUSE THE WHITE COLOUR IS A COATING OVER THE BLACK COLOUR, SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO SCRATCH IT BY ANY CHANCE, THE BLACK COLOR WILL SHOW.
      
      VIII)THE HERE MAPS AND HERE DRIVE IS VERY VERY ACCURATE. HOWEVER, YOU WILL NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE MAP OF YOUR REGION FOR OFFLINE NAVIGATION, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE PRETTY LARGE. YOU WILL BE SUGGESTED TO USE THE WIFI TO DOWNLOAD THE MAP.
      
      IX)THE LUMIA 720 MAKES YOUR SOCIAL LIFE BETTER. YOU WON'T NEED TO GO TO THE BROWSER TO CHECK YOU WALL OR YOUR INBOX OF YOUR MAIL. IT'S ALL THERE WELL ARRANGED AND KEEPS UPDATING.
      
      X) THE INTERNAL MEMORY THOUGH BEING 8GB, THE SOFTWARE AND WIN 8 OS TAKES A LITTLE SPACE AND LEAVES ABOUT 4.69GB FREE. SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET YOURSELF A MEMORY CARD. MAKE SURE IT'S COMPLETELY FORMATTED OR ELSE YOUR PHONE MIGHT START MALFUNCTIONING.
      
      XI)MUSIC QUALITY, BOTH WITH HEADPHONES AND WITHOUT IS BOMBASTIC.
      
      XII) IF YOU'RE KIND OF A SHOW OFF, YOU CAN EASILY SHOW IT OFF TO YOUR FRIENDS, AS THE DESIGN IS REALLY GOOD, FITS INTO YOUR HAND LIKE A DREAM AND MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A MAN (WOMAN IF YOU'RE FEMALE).
      
      XIII) DON'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING BACK YOUR CONTACTS FROM YOUR OLD PHONE. ACTIVATE THE BLUETOOTH ON BOTH THE DEVICES AND THE CONTACTS COME FLOWING IN.
      
      XIV)I SPENT 18100, SPENT ABOUT 300 EXTRA. BOUGHT IT FROM OUTSIDE, ONLY BECAUSE I NEEDED TO SEE THE SETUP AND THE SIM HAD TO BE CUT TO A MICRO SIM. THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE FROM A STORE.
      
      XV)NOW COMES THE FUNNIEST PART. THERE IS SOMETHING VERY FUNNY WITH THE MIC. IF YOU'RE LYING DOWN AND TALKING TO SOMEBODY, THEN DON'T. PERSON AT THE OTHER END WON'T BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU.
      
      NOW, SINCE I'M NOT MUCH OF A GAMER THIS PHONE SUITS ME. I USE THE INTERNET A LOT AND LISTEN TO MUSIC. SO, I NEED THE BATTERY. NOT THAT I DON'T PLAY GAMES AT ALL, I DO HAVE SOME GAMES AND PLAY THEM AND STILL HAVE SOME 5-6 HOURS BATTERY REMAINING. SO, KEEPING THE ABOVE MENTIONED THINGS IN MIND, PICK YOUR PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,I HAD BOUGHT THIS PHONE 5 DAYS AGO. GOT A REPLACEMENT BECAUSE THE PHONE IS HANGING. UNFORTUNATELY THE REPLACEMENT PIECE IS ALSO HANGING. THE PROBLEM IS IT TAKES &GT;6SEC TO LOAD THE SETTINGS. DO ANY ONE OF YOU FACE THIS PROBLEM. PLEASE HELP ME OUT WHETHER ALL THE LUMIA 720'S ARE TAKING TIME TO LOAD THE SETTINGS PAGE. IF YES I AM GOING TO KEEP THIS PHONE ELSE I WILL RETURN BACK THIS PHONE AND EXCHANGE WITH AN ANDROID PHONE. ALL BUYERS PLEASE REPLY ASAP
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT BEFORE 2 DAYS AND IT LOOKS AWESOME
      
      I AM BORED OF SCARY WASTE ANDRIOID WHICH ASKS EVERY DETAIL WITHOUT SECURITY
      
      AND LUMIA IS AN EXCELLENT AND SUPER FAST COMPATED TO ANDROID
      
      IF U WANT THOSE DIRTY APPS FROM ANDROID  YOU MAY NOT SEE IN THIS WINDOWS PHONE
      
      
      BUT WHAT ARE ESSENTIAL THOSE ARE THERE AND REMEMBER STILL IT IS DEVELOPING
      
      
      ITS AWESOME AS I USED SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB 2 ..I GOT BORED OF ANDROIDS .EVEN ANDROID IS GOOD BUT NO CHARGE BACKUP. AND IT LOSES CHARGE EVEN AFTER 2 HOURS OF BROWSING
      
      
      AND NOKIA HERE DRIVE IS FAR BETTER THAN GOOGLE MAPS AND I USED BOTH OF THEM
      
      WINDOWS HAS EVERY APP WHAT IS ESSENTIAL EX. WHATSAPP, WECHAT, VIBER, FACEBOOK AND MANY GAMES ETC.
      
      
      AND WHAT NEXT SWITCH TO LUMIA WITHOUT THINKING"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT THE LUMIA 720 MOBILE AND IDENTIFIED TWO PROBLEMS :
      
      1. LIVE TILES ARE COMING INTO BLACK COLOR AND
      
      2. LOCK ON SCREEN IMAGE IS DISAPPERING WHILE MUSIC IS RUNNING
      
      ACTUALLY THESE ARE NOT THE PROBLEMS, SOME SETTINGS DONE RESULTED THIESE.
      
      FOR 1ST ONE, PLEASE GO TO EASY ACCESS AND DISABLE HIGH CONTRAST AND FOR 2ND ONE, NOKIA MUSIC&GT; SOME WHERE ITIS PLEASE OFF THE OPTION DISPLAY ARTIST DETAILS.
      
      FOR THESE TWO ISSUES I WENT OT NOKIA CARE AND THEY DID NOT IDEDNTIFIED AND THEY DONE S/W UPDATE TWO TIMES. AGAIN AM SETTING THESE SETTINGFS AND  AM GETTING THESE ERRORS, AGAIN I WENT TO NOKIA CARE AND THEY SAID LIKE WE HAVE TO CHECK CHIP BOARD AND ASKED TO LEAVE THE CELL PHONE TO THEM FOR 7 DAYS(THEY NEED TO SEND TO DELHI NOKIA FACTORY)....TO AVOID ALL THESE PROBLEMS , CALLED UP FLIPKART AND EXPLAINED THE THE SITUATION. THEY EVEN, THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM DO NOT NKNOW THESE AND INITIATED THE REFUND PROCESS.
      
      THIS WAY I LOST MY FACVOURITE NOKIA LUMIA 720 - TO SAY OS PERFORMANCE IS ULTIMATE AND LOOKS WISE ITS KILLER, CAMERA IS AWESOME.
      
      
      ALL THESE SETTINGS WERE CAME TO KNOW THROUGH A NOKIA TRAINED CANDIDATES FOR SELLING THE LUMIA PRODUCTS. I SHOCKED SEEING THESE ANSWERS FROM THEM AND COULD NOT DO ANY MORE THEN.
      
      
      PLEASE THINK OVER...THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM FROM FLIPKART SIDE IS GOOD ENOUGH IN THIS WAY I WOULD NOT HAVE RETURNED MY CELL AND I WOULD BE ENJOYING LUMIA 720' JOY :("
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I JUST HAD THE CHANCE TO USE LUMIA 720(PERSONALLY I HAVE LUMIA 920). HERE'S WHAT I FELT ABOUT THE PHONE AFTER A DAY'S USE:
      
      PROS:
      
      1. SCREEN CLARITY: THE MOBILE HAS VERY GOOD SCREEN CLARITY. FRANKLY I FEEL BEST IN MID-RANGE.GO TO ANY SHOP AND COMPARE WITH GALAXY GRAND(TRUE COMP. TO LUMIA 720) AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. THERE IS LOT OF COMPARISION WITH LUMIA 620 BUT THE VIEWING ANGLES ARE JUST NOT THE SAME. TRUST ME, LUMIA 720, EVEN WITH LOWER PIXEL DENSITY HAS BETTER FEEL TO IT.
      
      2.CAMERA: CAMERA IS REALLY GOOD. BEST IN MID RANGE CLASS. COMPARE IT WITH HTC OR SAMSUNG GRAND 8MP CAMERA....LUMIA 720 IS BETTER IN DAYLIGHT AND MILES AHEAD IN NIGHT
      
      3. WINDOWS: IF ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER USED ANDROID AND THEN OPTED FOR WINDOWS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE CLEAR DIFFERENCE, IN TERMS OF SPEED AND RESPONSE. WINDOWS IS WAY AHEAD. ANDROID MIGHT BE HAVING LOT OF APPLICATIONS COMPARED TO WINDOWS BUT BELIEVE ME, YOU WILL NOT KEEP ANY OF THOSE EXTRA APPLICATION FOR MORE THAN A WEEK. REASON IS THE BATTERY CONSUMPTION, AND NOT TO MENTIONS BUGS THAT COME WITH THEM. WINDOWS HAS LESSER APPLICATION BUT ALL OF THEM ARE HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL AND ACTUALLY USEFUL. SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS ARE BETTER THAN THE CONTEMPORARIES IN ANDROID. ONLY APPLE I-PHONE HAS BETTER APPLICATION THAN WINDOWS AT PRESENT BUT THE PRICE OF I PHONE IS TOO MUCH. ALSO THE COMPATIBILITY WITH NON-APPLE DEVICES IS ISSUE. WINDOWS IS SIMPLE AND BRILLIANT
      
      BUILT QUALITY:  THE BUILT QUALITY OF THE MOBILE IS QUITE SUPERB. AFTER BUYING LUMIA 920 I HAVE REALIZED WHAT ACTUALLY IS A WELL BUILT PHONE. LUMIA 720 IS SCALED DOWN  VERSION OF 920. VERY GOOD BUILT QUALITY
      
      NOKIA MAPS: ONE VERY GOOD THING ABOUT NOKIA MAPS IS THAT THEY CAN BE USED OFFLINE ALSO.THIS FEATURE REALLY HELPS WHEN YOU ARE ON BIKING TRIP OR ANY OTHER TRIP. LOOSE YOUR WAY AND HAVE NO MOBILE CONNECTIVITY, THEN NOKIA MAPS REALLY HELP. GOOGLE MAPS IS BEST IN THE WORLD BUT NOKIA IS PRETTY MUCH COMPARABLE TO IT.ALSO YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD MAPS IN THE GOOGLE
      
      CONS:
      
      512 MB RAM: ALTHOUGH IT IS MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL THAN ACTUAL I DO FEEL THAT RAM SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1 GB.
      
      NO FM: FOR A MID RANGE PHONE THIS IS MUST
      
      THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO MAJOR DRAWBACKS IN LUMIA 720.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MID-RANGE PHONE THAT LOOKS WAY ABOVE IT'S PRICE, HAS GOOD CAMERA AND CAN LAST LONG...GO FOR LUMIA 720.
      
      IF YOU THINK YOU CAN REALLY SPEND UPTO 10 K MORE THAT I WILL SUGGEST SONY XPERIA SP OR LUMIA 820.BOTH ARE GREAT."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I ORDERED IT ON FRIDAY I.E 26TH APRIL AROUND 8PM OR SO AND I GOT IT DELIVERED ON SUNDAY(I STAY IN BANGALORE ITSELF) I WAS NOT EXPECTING IT TO BE DELIVERED ON SUNDAY BUT WHO DOESN'T LOVE SURPRISES.HMM COMING TO PHONE REVIEW, I GOT A CYAN ONE FOR ME AND IT LOOKS REALLY STUNNING.I GOT LITTLE AFRAID WHEN I WAS USING WITH FULL WIFI GPS AND BLUETOOTH ON WHEN THE BATTERY WAS AROUND 20%, AND AFTER 15MINS WHILE I WAS TRANSFERRING MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH IT FREEZED AND AFTER SEEING IT FREEZED ME TOO O_O I WAS WONDERING WHAT WENT WRONG ACTUALLY,THEN AFTER 5MINS IT TURNED OFF AND I WAS DUMB FOUND DEAD.I GAVE IT A TRY BY PLUGGING IT IN AND I WAS PRESSING THE ON BUTTON LIKE A NERD IGNORING THE FACT THAT I SHOULD KEEP IT IN CHARGING STATE FOR A WHILE ATLEAST.AND AFTER TEN MINUTES I TRIED SWITCHING IT ON THEN IT FINALLY GOT STARTED.SO THE BOTTOMLINE IS LET IT GAIN SOME MOMENTUM WHILE AFTER BEING DRAINED FOR THE FIRST TIME.LOVE ITS CAMERA AND CITY LENSES MOSTLY AND ITS SIZE IS JUST THE BEST THING NOKIA HAS GIVEN.BEST NOT TOO SMALL NOT TOO LARGE AND FEELS SUPERB WHILE HOLDING OR GETTING INTO THE POCKETS.PHONE IS WORTH THE BUY AND I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE IF THEY ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO BUY A NEW ONE.
      
      PS: I BROUGHT LUMIA 620 USED IT FOR A WEEK (GOT LOT OF EXPERIENCE FROM IT AND IT IS AMAZING, IF YOU HAVE LITTLE TIGHT BUDGET)THEN SOLD IT AS I THOUGHT LUMIA 720 WOULD TAKE FEW MONTHS TO GET ITS PRICE DROP SO COULDN'T WAIT AND AS SOON AS IT ARRIVED I HAD MADE UP MY MIND FOR L720. WAITING FOR SCREEN GUARD AS WELL :)"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I ORDERED THIS CELL ON 1ST JULY FOR RS.16599 N IT WAS DELIVERED ON 8TH JULY (IT WAS ALREADY INFORMED THAT THE DELIVERY LL TAKE 7-8 BUSINESS DAYS SO DAT WAS TIMELY DELIVERD STIL WUD HAV BEEN MORE CONTENDED IF DAT WAS 2-3 BUSINESS BCOZ 8 DAYS WS A LONG WAIT)..
      
      
      FLIPCART DID UPDATED THE ORDER STATUS SO IT WAS HELPFUL ORELSE I WS ABT TO CANCEL MY ORDER..
      
      
      ABOUT WS RETAILERS-
      
      1.THE PRODUCT WAS WELL PACKED,
      
      2. DELIVERY WAS ON TIME AS PROMISED,
      
      3. PRICE MIGHT B FEW BUCKS MORE OR LESS DEN D MARKET VALUE NT SURE, BT WENT IN FEW   SHOPS(MUMBAI) THE RANGE I FOUND WS 17000-17500 SO NT MUCH A DIFFERENCE..(DER MIGHT B SHOPS WER U CAN FIND IT FOR 16K BT DIDNT SEARCH MUCH)..
      
      
      ABOUT NOKIA LUMIA 720
      
      I M A NEW USER SO CANT COMMENT IN DETAIL..
      
      I FOUND THE TOUCH, CAMERA, UI, OS GOOD..ITS AWESOME I WOULD RECOMMEND DIS PHONE FOR AL DOS WHO R NT MUCH A GAMER(APPS FREAK)- THOUGH U CAN RUN N FIND LOT OF POPULAR,GOOD GAMES N APPS HERE, WANT GOOD CAMERA, SLIM LOOKS, GOOD TOUCHSCREEN, STURDY PHONE WID LONG BATTERY LIFE..I DO MISS MY FM RADIO( BT DERS A MIX RADIO WER U FIND MANY SONGS)..."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I USED THIS PHONE SINCE LAST MONTH . THIS IS A GOOD PHONE , DAY LIGHT CAMERA PHOTO QUALITY IS VERY GOOD. PHONE'S GRAPHICS &AMP; SOUND QUALITY AWESOME BUT LOW LIGHT CAMERA PHOTO QUALITY NOT SO GOOD. OTHERWISE THIS IS A BEST MID-RANGE PHONE. THIS PHONE IS BATTER THEN LUMIA 520 AND 620."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I WAS IN LOVE WITH WINDOWS 8 WHEN I SAW 920.. I WAS VERY EAGER TO LAY MY HAND ON THAT MOBILE. HOWEVER I THOUGHT ITS TOO COSTLY FOR A MOBILE PHONE.THEN NOKIA RELEASED 720 WITHIN MY BUDGET AND WITH ALL MOST ALL THE FEATURES OF 920 IN IT.
      
      
      IF YOU TALK ABOUT ANDROID PHONES, FOR EX SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND, GALAXU DUOS AND WHEN COMPARED WITH ANY OTHER ANDROID PHONES IT IS MUCH BETTER FOR ITS SIMPLICITY , NEW LOOK, NEW APPS, NEW WAY OF USING PHONE. IT DEFINED THAT NOT ONLY ANDROID PHONES ARE PHONES BUT ALSO WINDOWS PHONES.
      
      
      NOT TO FORGET ABOUT NOKIA'S STRONG BUILD QUALITY. I DONT LIKE SAMSUNG AS ALL ITS MODELS LOOKS THE SAME AND ALSO THE SAME OS WITH SOME BEAUTIFUL CUSTOMIZATIONS WHICH CAN HARDLY BE USED BY BUSY GUYS. ON ANY WEEKEND ONE SHOULD SIT ON THEIR COUCH AND HAS TO BROWSE THROUGH THEIR SAMSUNG CUSTOMIZATIONS AND FEEL HAPPY THAT MY PHONE HAS THIS FEATURE.
      
      
      ON A WHOLE I LIKE THE WINDOWS 8 ON NOKIA PHONES AND ALSO ITS NEW INNOVATIONS FEEL THAT NOKIA WILL DEFINITELY IMPROVE ITS SALES WITH 720 AND WITH BETTER MODELS THAT ARE COMING IN FUTURE.
      
      
      EAGERLY WAITING FOR IT TO BE DELIVERED . HOPE IT WILL COME BY TOMORROW. :)
      
      
      FINALLY I GOT IT. THANKS TO FLIPKART WITH A REQUEST RAISED TO DELIVER IT EARLIER THAN THE EXPECTED DELIVERY, THEY PRIORITIZED IT AND GOT IT 2 DAYS EARLY.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS LIKE A GLAMOROUS FASHION STAR WALKING ON THE RAMP, IT VERY BEAUTIFUL , SLEEK, STYLISH, STUNNING , LIGHT WEIGHTED , SMOOTH IN OPERATION.
      
      
      OPENING AND CLOSING APPS IN A JIFFY. NO LAG AS OF NOW, I HAVE TO TEST DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE, VOICE CLARITY , EAR PHONES SOUND CLARITY AND HOW FAR SPACE IT CAN TAKE.
      
      
      I SUGGEST ANY ANDROID USER TO SWITCH TO LUMIA 720 IN PARTICULAR AS IT IS A BEST PHONE IN A REASONABLE PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      :)"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I'M PROMISING THAT I WON'T COMPARE THIS DEVICE WITH ANY OTHER CHEAP ANDROID ONE.COMING QUICKLY TO PROS AND CONS OF THIS DEVICE
      
      
      PROS:-
      
      1.USER INTERFACE IS JUST OUT OF THIS WORLD WITH TILES.,ONE OF MY FRIEND HAD TOLD WINDOWS OS 7 ONWARDS WAS MADE FOR MOBILES,CAME TO KNOW WHY AFTER BUYING THIS BEAUTIFUL HANDSET.
      
      2.ALMOST ALL APPS RUN SMOOTHLY WITH 512 MB RAM!!OH..
      
      3.MUSIC QUALITY IS JUST BRILLIANT WITH DOLBY HEADPHONE TECHNOLOGY.
      
      4.DISPLAY IS JUST AWESOME.,WHAT CAN YOU ASK FOR IN A 18K HANDSET.
      
      5.THERE ARE MANY GOOD GAMES FOR FREAKS.
      
      
      THIS DEVICE HAS SOME CONS TOO,AFTER ALL ITS JUST A ELECTRONIC DEVICE.
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      1.FOR REGULAR FM LISTENERS THIS WILL BE A DISAPPOINTMENT,CURRENT SOFTWARE (HARDWARE SUPPORTS)DOESN'T SUPPORT FM :( I READ IN SOME NOKIA BLOG AN UPDATE IS COMING FOR FM,HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE ASAP.
      
      2.THE HEADSET WHICH COMES WITH THE BOX IS ABSOLUTELY CHEAP ONE,BETTER BUY SONY OR SOME OTHER GOOD HEADPHONES.
      
      3.SOME WELL KNOWN APPS ARE PAID ONES."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"IN ONE WORD NOKIA+WINDOWS COMBINATION IS A SUPERB.
      
      
      THE PHONE DEFINITELY MATCHED THE EXPECTATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THE LOOKS, PERFORMANCE &AMP; THE CAMERA.
      
      
      THE GOOD THING IS I FOUND ALMOST ALL THE USEFUL APPS THAT I WANT IN WINDOWS 8 AND HOPING TO HAVE THE MISSED ONE OUT THERE PRETTY SOON.
      
      
      AND, FLIPKART WAS DONE REALLY A GOOD JOB FOR PROVIDING A GOOD DEAL ALONG WITH A QUIKER DELIVERY.
      
      
      SORRY ANDROID BUT I HAVE MOVED ON... NOKIA LUMIA IS BACK IN THE REAL BUSINESS NOW AND I AM HAPPY TO FIND IT"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"ITS BEEN A WEEK SINCE I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT... I WENT FOR THIS PURCHASE AFTER GOING THROUGH THE REVIEWS FROM THE USERS OF THIS PRODUCT.... AND IN GENERAL I FOUND POSITIVE REVIEWS FROM MOST OF THE USERS... SO JUST THOUGHT OF REVIEWING MY EXPERIENCE TOO...I HAD BOTH GOOD AS WELL AS SOME BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE...GOING WITH THE LOOKS AND BUILT UP... THIS PHONE IS AWESOME... BUT I FACED QUITE A FEW ISSUES WHILE USING THIS PHONE..ALONG THIS ONE WEEK USAGE I HAD TO RESTART THIS PHONE MAYBE ATLEAST 5-6 TIMES BECAUSE IT GET HANGS WITHOUT EVEN THE USAGE OF MUCH OF ITS APPLICATIONS.... SECONDLY I AM HAVING A HARD TIME COPPING UP WITH WINDOWS 8... I FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT IN ACCESSING THE THINGS WHEN COMPARED TO MY PREVIOUS NOKIA SYMBIAN SET...I GOT FRUSTRATED WHILE TRYING TO TRANSFER A PDF FILE THAT I DOWNLOADED FROM MY MAIL THROUGH THIS PHONE TO MY PC... I CAN OPEN THIS PARTICULAR FILE IN THE PHONE USING PDF READER.. BUT THERE IS NO OPTION TO SEND IT THROUGH BLUETOOTH OR DATA CABLE TO THE PC... SO I THOUGHT I WOULD DIRECTLY COPY IT FROM THE SD CARD..BUT HUH!! BINGO YOU CANNOT OPEN SD EITHER....WTF!!(MAY BE THERE IS SOME OTHER WAY WHICH I AM NOT AWARE OF) BUT THESE THINGS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THAT HARD... WINDOWS8 SHOULD HAVE MADE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY OR EASY TO ACCESS ITS FILES....AND CAN ANYONE TELL ME HOW TO CHECK THE LOG DETAILS.. LIKE CALL DURATION HISTORY ETC USING THIS SET...
      
      APART FROM THAT CAMERA, MAPS, CONTACTS &AMP; MAIL SYNCRONIZATIONS WITH FB, GMAIL ETC... ARE ALL GOOD...TOUCH IS AWESOME...THREADS MESSAGING IS ALSO COOL,
      
      IN GENERAL THE PHONE AND THE BUILT UP SEEMS TO BE GOOD... BUT STILL HAVE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE WINDOWS8 OS...WHICH HAS BEEN A BIT IRRITATING IN SOME CASES.... HOPE WILL FIND SOME WAY TO GET THESE THINGS DONE ANWAY"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"IT'S NOW ALMOST A WEEK THAT I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH MY LUMIA 720. SO FAR, IT HAS GIVEN ME SATISFACTORY RESPONSES AND PERFORMED REALLY WELL. WINDOWS 8 RUNS WELL, WITH OUT ANY DRAGS OR LAGS AND THE UI IS VERY SMOOTH. THE TOUCH SCREEN IS SUPER SENSITIVE AND RESPONSES REALLY WELL.
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      SIMPLY SUPERB! THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE PHONE WORTH THE PRICE. THE 6.7 MP CARL ZEISS LENS WITH AN APERTURE OF F1.9 CAPTURES MAXIMUM POSSIBLE LIGHT EVEN IN LOW CONDITIONS COMPARED TO ITS COMPETITORS. NOKIA'S SMART SHOOT IS ANOTHER MAJOR ATTRACTION IN THE PHONE. HELPS REALLY WELL TO GET THE BEST PICTURES BY AUTO-ADJUSTING AMONG THE CAPTURED IMAGES. IT PROVIDES THE USER TO DELETE UNWANTED OBJECT FROM THE IMAGE AS WELL. 5/5 FOR THE CAMERA! NOKIA WINS HERE.
      
      
      BATTERY BACK-UP:
      
      BUILT IN 2000 MAH BATTERY. I CHARGE IT TO 100% IN THE MORNING. MOBILE DATA CONNECTION IS TURNED ON TILL EVENING AFTER WHICH I SWITCH TO WI-FI. MODERATE CALLS, SMS, AROUND 1 HR MUSIC PLAYBACK, WHATSAPP ALMOST EVERY NOW AN THEN. BATTER SAVING IS TURNED ON. I'VE ALSO INSTALLED THE ""BATTERY"" APP. NOW THE TIME IS 8.30 PM AND THE BATTERY IS NOW AT 56% AND SHOWS A REMAINING TIME OF 18 HOURS!! AND YES, IF NOT 18, THE PHONE DOES NOT RUN SHORT OF JUICE TILL THE NEXT MORNING FOR SURE.
      
      
      VOICE QUALITY:
      
      THIS IS WHERE NOKIA FAILED. I'M CERTAIN THAT MOST OF THE LUMIA USERS MUST HAVE HEARD THE PERSON AT THE OTHER END SAY ""HELLO..HELLO"" REPEATEDLY WHICH IS BECAUSE THE VOICE FROM THIS END BREAKS IN BETWEEN. THE MIC ISSUE IS CURRENTLY UNDER DISCUSSION IN THE MICROSOFT FORUM. USERS HAVE COME UP WITH DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND FIXES. HOWEVER, IT IS QUITE DISAPPOINTING THAT MICROSOFT HAS NOT COME UP WITH A WORK-AROUND FOR THIS YET. STILL, THE PHONE SELLS LIKE HOT CAKES.
      
      
      MUSIC QUALITY:
      
      LUMIA 720 COMES WITH DOLBY SOUND ENHANCEMENT WHICH CAN REALLY BE ENJOYED BETTER WHEN USED A GOOD QUALITY HEADPHONES OTHER THAN THE STOCK PIECE THAT COMES INSIDE THE BOX. I USE A PAIR OF SENNHEISER MX160 HEADPHONES AND THE QUALITY IS AWESOME!
      
      APART FROM ALL THESE, THE BUILD QUALITY IS VERY SOLID. THE PHONE IS 9MM THICK BUT YOU WILL ACTUALLY FEEL IT THINNER.
      
      PROS:
      
      CAMERA
      
      BATTERY BACK UP
      
      BUILD QUALITY

      IN-CALL QUALITY
      
      
      CONS:
      
      VOICE BREAK UP DURING A CALL.
      
      
      OVERALL I WOULD TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE. HOPING THAT THE VOICE ISSUE WILL BE FIXED SOON"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"ITS NOW ALMOST TWO WEEKS SINCE I BOUGHT THE L 720. THERE WAS AN INITIAL PROBLEM THAT THE NETWORK SIGNAL WAS GETTING CUT OFTEN. HOWEVER, I COULD OVERCOME THE PROBLEM BY PLACING A NEW MICRO SIM WHICH I GOT FROM THE NETWORK PROVIDER. EARLIER I WAS USING A 4 YEAR OLD SIM WHICH WAS CUT IN SIZE TO MAKE IT A MICRO SIM. AFTER USING THE NEW SIM THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO HAVE GOT OVER.
      
      
      WEATHER YOU BUY FROM FLIPKART OF ANY OTHER STORE FIND OUT HOW TO HARD RESET  &AMP; SOFT RESET YOUR PHONE. THIS WILL BE ESSENTIAL IF AT ALL YOUR PHONE FREEZES UP.
      
      
      FIRST OF ALL THE GOOD OBSERVATIONS:-
      
      
      SCREEN ? GOOD, GOOD CLARITY AND READABLE IN SUNLIGHT
      
      
      BATTERY ? GREAT , PROVIDE ME ALMOST A 2 DAYS ( IM A MODERATE USER). I HAD A BATTERY PROBLEM WHEN I WAS USING THE OLD SIM , THE PHONE WOULD BE TRYING TO SEARCH THE TOWER SIGNAL DUE TO FREQUENT SIGNAL FLUCTUATIONS. BUT SINCE THE TIME I HAVE REPLACED A NEW SIM THE BATTERY LIFE HAS IMPROVED.
      
      
      BUILD QUALITY -  GREAT
      
      
      CAMERA ? GREAT,  ALTHOUGH I STILL HAVE TO EXPLORE ALL THE FEATURES
      
      
      MUSIC OUTPUT ? GREAT ON HEADPHONES WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM NOKIA STORE.
      
      WHEN LISTENING THROUGH SPEAKERS I WOULD SAY ? GOOD BUT NOT GREAT.
      
      
      NAVIGATION FUNCTIONS - GREAT
      
      
      SOME OBSERVATIONS WHICH I FELT COULD BE IMPROVED :-
      
      
      APPS - I AM COMPARING THIS TO THE ANDROID MARKET AS I HAVE AN ANDROID PHONE TOO. THE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT THAT GREAT , THE GOOD GAMES ARE ALL PAID. HOPE THIS WILL IMPROVE IN THE COMING YEARS WHEN THERE ARE SUFFICIENT DEVELOPERS.
      
      
      HARDWARE ? SUFFICIENT FOR A MODERATE USER LIKE ME. THE LOADING TIME FOR APPS IS SLIGHTLY MORE COMPARED TO THE L820. RAM SEEMS SUFFICIENT. YET CANNOT PIN POINT WEATHER INCREASING THE RAM OR INCREASING THE PROCESSOR SPEED WOULD SOLVE THIS.  FOR MAKING CALLS AND OTHER FUNCTIONS LIKE SCROLLING THROUGH PAGES THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM APPEARS WHEN LOADING APPLICATIONS.
      
      
      OVER ALL SOFTWARE PACKAGE ? I HAVE BEEN USING  SYMBIAN PHONE FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS. I FELT THAT THE SIMPLICITY OF MAKING CALLS WHICH IS THE BASIC FUNCTION FOR ANY PHONE WAS ?BANG ON? IN THE SYMBIAN . HOWEVER, IN THE LUMIA SERIES IT IS A BIT DIFFICULT . NO SPEED DIALS , NO QUICK WAYS TO MAKE A CALL TO FREQUENTLY USED NUMBERS
      
      
      FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT THE PHONE IS GOOD ONE WITH GOOD BUILD QUALITY, GREAT BATTERY LIFE AND A DECENT ECOSYSTEM FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT. HOPE IT WILL IMPROVE WITH THE AMBER UPDATE.  HOWEVER , IF ONE IS AN AVID APP USER TRYING VARIOUS GAMES AND APPS THEN GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES DROID HAS AN EDJE OVER WP8 ."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"ITS WINDOWS SO NO NEED USE LARGE AMOUNT OF PROCESSORS AND RAM BUT
      
      
      CONS: APPS-LESS SAR VALUE-VERY HIGH RAM-512MB FOR THIS PRICE? PROCESSORS-NEED SOME EXTRA PROCESSORS ,NO FILE MANAGER ,SOME APPS CANNOT RESPOND FAST(D MY FRIEND OWN A CHALLENGE AT HYDRABAD WINDOWS MOBILE CONTEST) ,IF WE PLAYING BIG GAMES PHONE BE BURN
      
      
      PROS:SUPER DISPLAY I CAN GIVE CHALLENGE TO HTC ONE,PEOPLE APP,OFFICE,MAPS,INTERNAL MEMORY
      
      
      FRIENDS XOLO IS BEST FOR THIS RANGE  BUT I FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE BECAUSE THIS PHONE DISPLAY ATTRACTED"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"I'VE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR THREE WEEKS NOW AND EACH DAY,I FELL MORE AND MORE IN LOVE WITH IT.
      
      FOR THOSE OF YOU WHOSE PHONE GOT SWITCH OFF FOR NO REASON,PRESS DOWN THE VOLUME KEY AND POWER KEY SIMULTANEOUSLY.WORKS WITH ME.ANOTHER OPTION IS,REMOVE THE SIM CARD AND FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"JUST TWO DAYS BACK I GOT MY PHONE &AMP; I FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE. ITS SO SLEEK,HANDY AND RICH IN LOOKS THAT I COULD NOT ABLE TO LEAVE MY PHONE FOR A SECOND. I GOT ALL THE REQUIRED SOFTWARE FREE FROM WINDOWS MARKET(EG. SKYPE, SKYDRIVE, WHATSAPP, WECHAT, UC BROWSER ETC ETC).IN THIS NEWER VERSION (WINDOWS 8)WE CAN SHARE IMAGES, MUSICS &AMP; VIDEOS (ONLY THOSE WHICH ARE RECORDED FROM THE PHONE CAMERA)TO ANY PHONE IRRESPECTIVE OF OS.HOPEFULLY VIDEO SHARING LIMITATION ALSO BE RECTIFIED IN ITS NEXT UPDATE.THANKS NOKIA FOR MAKING SUCH WONDERFUL PIECE OF HANDSET."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,LUMIA 720 HAS BEEN ORDERED ON SATURDAY WHEN IT WAS LISTED FOR 16545(BEST PRICE IN THE MARKET BUT CURRENTLY LISTED AS 18094) WHICH HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN 24 HOURS.THE PHONE IS AWESOME NO LAG SO FAR. ITS BUTTER SMOOTH WHEN IT COMES TO USER EXPERIENCE.AUDIO LOOKS TO BE HAVING SOME ISSUE WHEN I HOLD IT IN HAND NEED TO CONFIRM THAT.WILL POST MY REVIEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE PHONE AFTER A WEEK.FLIPKART SERVICE IS AWESOME.IT WOULD BE BETTER IF FLIPKART DOESNT PLAY WITH THE PRICE.
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"NOKIA HAS COME OUT WITH FLYING COLOURS(LITERALLY) WITH THE LUMIA SERIES.
      
      IT HAS BEEN A WEEK SINCE I GOT MY PHONE AND I AM LOVING IT. THE TALK OF THE TOWN IS THE COLOUR OF THE MOBILE. I BOUGHT A CYAN LUMIA 720 AND KUDOS TO NOKIA FOR COMING OUT WITH SUCH MAGNIFICENT COLOURS WHEN ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS ARE A BIT SKEPTICAL.
      
      
      THANKS TO THE BLISTERING FAST FLIPKART DELIVERY. LOVE YOU GUYS."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"NOKIA IS TRYING TO GET BACK INTO THE MARKET AND I WOULD SAY LUMIA 720 CERTAINLY  IS A SPIKE FOR THEM.
      
      
      CHEERS TO FLIPKART! THX FOR THAT FAST DELIVERY.
      
      
      EVER SINCE I STARTED KEEPING A PHONE..IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN NOKIA FOR ME BUT THIS TIME, SEEING OTHERS, I WAS INTERESTED TO GO FOR A ANDROID PHONE. BUT IT HAS BECAME SO COMMON(WHAT I FELT) AND THERE NOTHING NEW TO EXPLORE IN YOUR PHONE(I HAVE ALSO ACCESSED THE ANDROID PLATFORM). SO I TOOK A RISK AND AGAIN OPTED MY VERY OWN TRUSTED WITH TIME NOKIA(THIS TIME WITH A WINDOWS PLATFORM).
      
      I GOT THIS PHONE ON THIS TUESDAY AND SINCE THEN I AM TOTALLY INTO IT.
      
      
      SO, AVOIDING THE SPECIFICATIONS(EVERYBODY KNOWS IT), HERE IS WHAT I EXPERIENCED-
      
      
      POSITIVES -
      
      
      - KIDDOS TO WINDOWS FOR THIS NICE, NEW AND ATTRACTIVE UI.
      
      - THE TOUCH IS SUPERB AND I LOVE THOSE LIVE TILES.
      
      - THE PHONE IS SLEEK, HANDY WITH THE SMART LOOK WITH A SUPERB MATTE FINISH(MINE IS BLACK)
      
      - CAMERA IS GOOD WITH AMAZING AND INTERESTING APPS(THE CAMERA APPS).
      
      - FOR THOSE WHO CRITICIZE WINDOWS APPS STOCK GO AND HAVE A LOOK INTO THE WINDOWS STORE. YOU HAVE ALL THE REQUIRED APPS(AT LEAST WHAT I NEEDED).
      
      - CALL QUALITY IS LOUD AND SOOTHING(BOTH ON THE SPEAKER AND ON THE CALL).
      
      - FOR THOSE WHO SAY 'MY PHONE GOT HANGED 4 TIMES WITHIN AN HOUR'....MINE NEVER DID. EITHER THERE IS A PROBLEM SPECIFICALLY IN YOUR SET OR ELSE GO AND LEARN TO USE A PHONE.
      
      
      POSITIVES AGAIN(WITH A LITTLE AVOIDABLE NEGATIVE) -
      
      
      - NO CONNECTIVITY ISSUE BUT YOU CAN'T PLAY VIDEOS OF SOME PARTICULAR FORMATS.
      
      - NOKIA YOU COULD HAVE PROVIDED A BETTER LOOKING HEADPHONES.
      
      - THE PHONE GETS HEAT UP A LITTLE(NO WORRIES) WHEN YOU ARE ON A CALL WITH THE CHARGER PLUGGED IN.
      
      - AS THEY(NOKIA) SAY ABOUT THE BATTERY(2000MAH). ITS NOT THAT GOOD BUT IT IS BETTER THAN OTHER SMART-PHONES. ON A NORMAL USE(SURFING NET, WHTSAPP, ATTENDING CALLS) WITHOUT PLAYING GAMES IT CAN LAST FOR 36 HOURS.
      
      - 512 MB RAM IS NOT A DRAWBACK FOR THOSE WHO DON'T PLAY TOO MUCH GAMES(MY CASE).
      
      
      IT HAS IT ALL. I WOULD SUGGEST TO GO FOR IT."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS THE MOST SLIMMEST OF ALL THE LUMIAS. WHILE LIKE ALL OTHER LUMIAS, IT HAS ITS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS, YET IT TOO SHARE THE COMMON DNA, I.E. IT IS A WINDOWS PHONE 8.
      
      HERE'S WHAT I FOUND GREAT ABOUT THIS BEAUTIFUL PHONE:-
      
      1. BEAUTIFUL DESIGN:- BEING CALLED THE SLIM AND SLEEK, LUMIA 720 WEIGHS JUST 128 GRAM AND IT FEELS GREAT IN YOUR HAND. JUST LIKE 920, LUMIA 720 HAS A UNIBODY DESIGN. FINGERPRINTS SHOULD BE LESS OF A PROBLEM TOO, AS THE 4.3? CLEARBLACK GORILLA GLASS 2.0 DISPLAY HAS EASY TO CLEAN TECHNOLOGY THAT ALSO BOOSTS VISIBILITY FROM DIFFERENT AND WIDER ANGLES. ALSO, IT IS ALSO THE FIRST TO HAVE CURVED GLASS AT THIS PRICE POINT!
      
      2. CAMERA:- THE LUMIA 720 HAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CAMERA AT THIS PRICE POINT. USUALLY, WE GET A 5MP CAMERA, BUT THIS PHONE HAS A 6.7MP CAMERA WITH CARL ZEISS OPTICS. JUST NOT THIS, THE PHONE TOO BOASTS TO HAVE A 1.3MP FRONT FACING CAMERA. I JUST LOVED THE GLAM ME APP WHICH MAKES GREAT USE OF THE FRONT FACING CAMERA!
      
      3. APPS:- LUMIA 720 PACKS GREAT APPS THAT COME PRE-INSTALLED LIKE NOKIA'S EXCLUSIVES, LIKE HERE SUITE, CAMERA LENSES LIKE SMART SHOOT, GLAM ME AND ALSO COMES WITH ONE YEAR SUBSCRIPTION OF NOKIA MUSIC UNLIMITED. THE APPS IN THE WINDOWS PHONE STORE THOUGH NEEDS TO GROW, BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE BIG NAMES.
      
      4. WIRELESS CHARGING:- OKAY, WIRELESS CHARGING IS NOT FULLY BAKED IN NOKIA LUMIA 720. THERE ARE 3 CONNECTORS ON THE BACK OF YOUR PHONE WHICH ARE SOMEWHAT CONNECTED TO BATTERY. IN ORDER TO CHARGE WIRELESSLY, ONE NEEDS 2 THINGS, FIRST- A WIRELESS CHARGER, AND THEN, A WIRELESS CLIP ON COVER WHICH NOKIA HAS SAID DURING THE LAUNCH.
      
      5. STORAGE:- THE PHONE HAS 8GB OF STORAGE SPACE WHICH CAN BE MADE EVEN BIGGER BY ADDING A MICROSD CARD OF UPTO 64GB. THIS IS GREAT.
      
      6. THE TOUCHSCREEN:- THE TOUCHSCREEN IS A 4.3"" CLEARBLACK WVGA LCD, 2.25 D GLASS, WITH THE SUPER SENSITIVE TOUCH THAT EVEN WORKS WITH YOUR FINGERNAILS AND CAR KEYS! AND OOPS, I FORGOT TO MENTION, IT HAS CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2.0
      
      7. BATTERY:- THIS IS WHERE NOKIA LUMIA 720 STANDS OUT OF THE CROWD JUST LIKE 920. BOTH OF THEM HAS 2000MAH BATTERY. ON MY USE, I HAVE FOUND THAT A FULL CHARGE ENSURES A GREAT DAY OF USE.
      
      HERE'S WHY IT MAKES YOU TO BUY NOKIA LUMIA 820:-
      
      RAM:- WITH JUST 512MB OF RAM, SOME APPS LIKE TEMPLE RUN ARE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN FOR THIS PHONE. SOME APPS ARE OPTIMISED ONLY FOR PHONES WITH 1GB OF RAM. HOWEVER, DEVELOPERS USUALLY OPTIMISE THEIR APPS FOR 512MB RAM TOO, BUT A LITTLE LATER. SO, RAM CAN BE A ISSUE TO BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU ARE A GAMER. BUT, I'M FINE WITH THIS!
      
      FINAL VERDICT:- NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS A GREAT PHONE, IN SHORT A VERSION OF 920 MADE ON BUDGET. IT HAS A GREAT CAMERA WITH SO MANY LENSES (LENSES ARE THERE ON WINDOWS PHONE STORE). IT HAS GREAT BATTERY LIFE. IT FLAUNTS A UNIBODY DESIGN. IN SHORT, IT HAS THE BEST LUMIA ELEMENTS. BUT YES, WHEN COMPARED TO LUMIA 620, IT HAS NOT MUCH TO OFFER AND THE PRICE DIFFERENCE IS SOMEWHAT THAT MAKES MANY TO BUY 620 OVER THIS. THE 620 IS MADE WITH TEENAGE CROWD IN MIND, WHILE 720 HAS A REALLY SOPHISTICATED LOOK. ALL-IN-ALL, I LOVE MY NOKIA LUMIA 720!"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"ONE THE BEST PHONE OUT THERE AT PRESENT PRICE POINT.
      
      NOKIA WITH WINDOWS IS VERY GOOD. HARDWARE OF THE PHONE IS NICE AND LOOKS GOOD...CAMERA OPTICS ARE BEST IN CLASS.
      
      YOU GET NOKIA MUSIC FREE..HAVE ALL SONGS U CAN ASK FOR...
      
      OFFLINE MAPS ARE GOOD AND CITY LENS IS ALSO VERY NICE APP.
      
      BEAT THING IS PEOPLES HUB...THAT IS REALLY AWESOME... ALL UR SOCIAL ACCOUNTS AT ONE PLACE AND SORTED AS PER CONTACTS ALSO...GROUPS ETC.
      
      SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT WILL NOT BE UPGRADED AS WINDOWS 7.5 WAS NOT...TELL ME WHICH UNDER 20000/- PHONE WAS UPDATED TO LATEST ANDROID VERSION...ITS ONLY THE NEW MODEL WHICH COMES WITH NEW VERSION...EVEN MANY HIGH END PHONES ARE NOT UPDATED.
      
      I AM USING ONE AND I KNOW HOW SMOOTH AND EFFICIENT THIS OS IS.. BELIEVE ME EARLIER I HAD S2 WHICH ALSO WAS GOOD PHONE BUT EASE OF USE I FIND WINDOWS BETTER MORE EFFICIENT.
      
      
      PEOPLES FIRST YOU SHOULD THINK IT AS PHONE THAN AS GAMING DEVICE... AND NOKIA PHONES EXCEL IN THAT DEPARTMENT NO HANGS.. NO CALL DROPS ...NO WEAK RECEPTION...NO SHOUTING ON MIC OF UR PHONE..."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"PURCHASED MINE ON APRIL 18, I THINK THE DAY IT WAS RELEASED OR NEXT DAY, IN RED COLOR. REVIEW IS DATED APRIL 24TH AND STRIKING THING I LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT THE HEADPHONE JACK HAS A VERY POOR FIT IN THE PHONE SOCKET.
      
      WILL ADD AS WE GO ALONG.
      
      UPDATE DT. 25-04: PLEASE NOTE THAT ISSUE MENTIONED WAS MORE FROM USER END AS I HAD NOT PROPERLY TRIED TO FIT THE PLUG INTO SOCKET AND NOT ANY FAULT OF THE PHONE AS CAN B EXPECTED."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"SHOULD SAY IT WAS A CHANCE I TOOK AND IT WAS WORTH IT.. THE PHONE IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE RANGE OFFERED... I AM NOT MUCH OF A PHONE GEEK BUT THE ONLY ISSUE WHICH IS THE POP THAT APPEARS ON THE TOP OF THE SCREEN WHICH CANT BE DISABLED.....APART FROM THAT, THE USER INTERFACE IS SMOOTH, THE SOUND SYSTEM IS GREAT ...OVERALL A GOOD BUY AND THANK YOU FLIPKART FOR DELIVERING IT ON TIME"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,SOME OF THE LATEST REVIEWS BY PPL MENTION THAT THEY BOUGHT LUMIA 720 AT AROUND 15K WHILE FLIPKART SHOWS ITS PRICE AS RS.17299...I DONT UNDERSTAND THEN HOW PPL BOUGHT IT AROUND 15K? WAS ANY SPECIAL DEAL OFFERED BY FLIPKART WHICH I MISSED OUT?
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"THE MOBILE IS GOOD WITH BUTTER SMOOTH TOUCH. NO LAGGING. DISPLAY (ENJOYING FULL HD VIDEOS) AND UI IS MARVELOUS. BROWSING IS NICE AND SUPERFAST (FEELING THE SPEED). BATTERY BACK UP IS GOOD AND FOR ABOVE AVERAGE USE I AM GETTING 2.5 DAYS. MS-OFFICE IS VERY GOOD WITH GOOD QUALITY READ/ WRITE. BUT SOME SHORT COMINGS. NO AUDIO/VIDEO TRANSFER VIA BLUETOOTH. EAR PHONES NORMAL. WINDOWS STORE HAS TO ADD SOME ESSENTIAL APPS VIZ. PAYTM, GTALK AND SOME GAMES WHICH ARE SUPERHIT IN ANDROID (SOME PEOPLE SHOWING DRAWBACK ABT APPS). BUT I AM NOT UNSATISFIED WITH APPS. AND FINALLY CAMERA, NO WORDS FOR IT. SIMPLY SUPERB AND MY LUMIA IS CYAN , WHAT AN EYE CATCHING PIECE."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"THIS BIRTHDAY I GIFT MYSELF LUMIA 720...!!
      
      
      (IGNORE POOR ENGLISH.. :-P)
      
      BOUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER SO MUCH RESEARCH. (AT RS. 17400 FROM LOCAL DEALER)
      
      I AM ENGINEER AND MY MAIN REQUIREMENTS ARE PHONE SHOULD WORK SMOOTH, BATTERY BACKUP MUST BE AT LEAST TILL NIGHT, INTERNET, MAILS, SOME GAMES AND GOOD CAMERA.
      
      INITIALLY I WAS CONFUSED BETWEEN 720 &AMP; 820... 820'S HARDWARE WERE BETTER BUT WP8 REALLY DONT REQUIRED THAT AND IT WILL EAT BATTERY... FINALLY DECIDED TO GET 720 FOR ITS BETTER LOOK, BETTER BATTERY AND 5K LESS PRICE.
      
      
      1. LOOK IS STUNNING.. NO DOUBT ABT THAT. (GOT BLACK SO THAT I CAN CHANGE LIVE TILE COLOURS..!)
      
      2. BUILT QUALITY IS AMAZING... NOKIA IS UNQUESTIONABLE IN THIS.
      
      3. IT DOESNT REQUIRED QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AND 1 GB RAM TO PERFORM FASTER THAN ANY ANDROID AT SIMILAR PRICE. IT WORKS REALLY BUTTER SMOOTH. FAR BETTER THAN GALAXY GRAND... AS I HAVE USED GRAND FOR 2-3 DAYS...
      
      4. SCREEN LOOKS BRILLIANT. FAR BETTER THAN GRAND (CLEAR BLACK DISPLAY), SUPER SENSITIVE TOUCH AND GORILLA GLASS PROTECTION... WOW...!!
      
      5. BATTERY: LAST FROM 7.30 AM TO 7.30 PM... WITH DATA CONNECTION ON.. GMAIL, FACEBOOK, HOTMAIL, WHATSAPP AND FACEBOOK CHAT ALL DAY... SYNC CONTINUOUSLY, NETSURFING FOR AROUND 1 HOUR IN A DAY, 15 MIN OF GAMEPLAY, REGULAR PHONE CALLS AND SOME OTHER MISC. USE.
      
      5. CAMERA IS VERY GOOD.
      
      6. OFF LINE MAPS AND NAVIGATION..!!
      
      7. MS OFFICE IS NECESSARY FOR ME.
      
      8. SKYDRIVE CLOUD STORAGE OF 7 GB FREE.
      
      9. UNLIMITED NOKIA MUSIC SUBSCRIPTION FOR LIFETIME.
      
      
      NOW SOME DRAWBACKS I HAVE FACED..
      
      1. WHATSAPP : U CAN SEND ONLY PICTURES... NO AUDIO OR VIDEO FILE.. (SAD, BUT ITS WHATSAPP'S FAILURE IT WILL GET UPDATE I HOPE)
      
      2. IN INTERNET EXPLORER... IF U OPEN NEW TAB THEN LOADING IN CURRENT TAB PAUSE...! IT WILL RESUME WHEN YOU SWITCHBACK TO THAT TAB
      
      3. NO FM RADIO (SAD FOR THOSE WHO ARE REGULAR RADIO LISTENER)"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"THIS IS A GREAT DEAL DEFINITELY...
      
      AWESOME SCREEN, CAMERA, TOUCH, DESIGN, COST BUT....
      
      
      ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT THE PIXEL DENSITY IS LOW.
      
      
      SO INTERNET BROWSING AND READING E-BOOKS MAY BE A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE READING THOSE SMALL TEXTS.
      
      
      BUT A GREAT DEAL... GO FOR IT  ;)"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"THIS IS MY FIRST SMART PHONE, I FEEL IT IS REALLY GOOD BUT WITH SOME MINOR DRAW BACKS BUT SURELY MICROSOFT CAN FIX THIS , MICROSOFT IS ALREADY PROVIDING UPDATES. SURELY GUYS YOU CAN OPT FOR IT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OTHER SMART PHONES MUCH, BUT THIS ONE IS GOOD"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"THIS PHONE IS EXCELLENT IN EVERY ASPECT EXCEPT FOR THE RAM.IF YOU ARE A GAMER A LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT.BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD,SCREEN RESOLUTION IS NICE.EXCELLENT LOW LIGHT IMAGING.THE ONLY MINUS I FIND IS THE HEADPHONES THEY ARE SUPPLIED WITH,THEY ARE HORRIBLE AND WON'T FIT COMFORTABLY IN THE EAR.REST ALL FEATURES ARE FANTASTIC"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"TOAST NOTIFICATION DISABLING :
      
      I AM UNABLE TO DISABLE THE TOAST NOTIFICATION. DO ANY OF YOU GUYS KNOW HOW TO DO THAT? IT IS GETTING REALLY FRUSTRATING THAT IT SHOWS UP EVEN WHEN THE PHONE IS LOCKED WITH PASSWORD.IT JUST POPS UP NO MATTER WHAT I AM DOING AND IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING WHEN A PRIVATE MESSAGE POPS UP WHEN YOUR FRIENDS/PARENTS ARE FIDDLING WITH YOUR NEW PHONE.
      
      
      PASSWORD PROTECTION FOR APPS(MESSAGING) :
      
      CAN I PASSWORD PROTECT INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS ESPECIALLY MESSAGING AND CONTACTS? I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY WAY.IF SO,PLEASE TELL ME.
      
      
      MESSAGING :
      
      CON :
      
      WHILE MESSAGING,IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CANNOT TAKE A CURSOR TO THE MIDDLE OF A WORD AND EDIT IT.EITHER YOU HAVE TO DELETE THE WORD COMPLETELY OR DELETE EACH LETTER FROM THE END OF THE WORD TO REACH THE POSITION WHERE YOU WANT TO EDIT.
      
      KEYBOARD FOR MESSAGING IS STANDARD QWERTY TOUCH.IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THERE IS A DIALER TYPE TOUCH KEYBOARD AS WELL FOR THOSE WHO ARE USED TO BASIC PHONES LIKE ME.SINCE QWERTY HAS SMALL BUTTONS,YOU ARE MOST LIKELY TO PRESS A WRONG LETTER.
      
      (PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG.IF THERE IS AN OPTION FOR THIS,PLEASE LET ME KNOW.)
      
      PRO :
      
      THE SUGGESTIONS THAT IT SUGGESTS IS BRILLIANT.IT EVEN WORKS WELL WITH TRANSLITERATED WORDS.
      
      WHEN THERE ARE MORE OPTIONS TO BE SUGGESTED FOR A HALF TYPED WORD,IT ALWAYS SUGGESTS THE WORD THAT YOU HAVE IN MIND!!WELL.IT DOESN'T READ YOUR MIND BUT LEARNS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AS YOU USE,I GUESS.
      
      FOR EXAMPLE,WHEN I TYPED ""CHA"" IT SUGGESTED ""CHANGE"" WHILE I ACTUALLY MEANT ""CHARGE"". FROM THE SECOND TIME IT SUGGESTED ""CHARGE"". WELL.YOU COULD ASK WHAT IF I HAD ACTUALLY MEANT ""CHANGE"" THE SECOND TIME? MAY BE IT SUGGESTS DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT.MAY BE NOT.
      
      
      BRIGHTNESS :
      
      YOU HAVE ONLY HIGH,MEDIUM AND LOW.THERE IS NO SLIDER.THIS IS NOT A BIG CONCERN.HOWEVER,IT IS ONE EXAMPLE THAT I KNOW OF THAT WP8 HAS LITTLE CUSTOMIZING OPTIONS.
      
      
      CAMERA :
      
      1. ""CINEMAGRAPH"" WORKS FLAWLESSLY AS EXPECTED.IT IS COOL THAT YOU YOURSELF CAN SELECT THE REQUIRED AREA OF ANIMATION.
      
      2. ""SOFTEN SKIN"" FEATURE WORKS SMOOTHLY.IT REMOVES THE ROUGHNESS AND GRAINS IN THE FACE IF ANY.
      
      3. ""GLAM ME"" IS NICE ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE CALLED A VERY USEFUL AND UNIQUE FEATURE.""MAGAZINE"" AND ""DRIZZLES ON A WINDOW"" MODE IS QUITE ATTRACTIVE.
      
      4.PICTURE QUALITY IS VERY CRISP AND CLEAR IN THE NORMAL SIZE(FITS THE SCREEN). AFTER ZOOMING,CLARITY GETS REDUCED. MAY BE BECAUSE OF A RELATIVELY LOW MEGA PIXELS OR LOW SCREEN RESOLUTION,I AM NOT SURE.
      
      5. YET TO TEST LOW LIGHT IMAGING,FLASH,SMART SHOOT ...
      
      6. ""ERASE OBJECTS"" FEATURE SEEMS AWESOME IN THE AD.I HOPE IT IS.I HAVE TRIED WITH SOME MOVING OBJECTS.SO FAR I HAVE HAD NO SUCCESS.
      
      
      CALL QUALITY AND AUDIO OUTPUT:
      
      1.IT IS VERY CLEAR.YET TO SEE ITS PERFORMANCE IN A NOISY PLACE.
      
      
      NOKIA MUSIC : YET TO EXPLORE.
      
      NOKIA CITY LENS : YET TO EXPLORE.
      
      NOKIA DRIVE : YET TO EXPLORE.
      
      NOKIA MAPS  : YET TO EXPLORE. (AND COMPARE IT WITH GOOGLE MAPS)
      
      
      OVERALL THOUGHTS :
      
      I HAVE JUST USED IT FOR A DAY AND HAVE ALREADY STARTED FEELING THAT MICROSOFT HAS COMPROMISED ON PRIVACY AND HAS VERY LITTLE CUSTOMIZING OPTIONS.
      
      
      IF I AM WRONG,PLEASE EDUCATE ME ON THAT.
      
      
      HOWEVER, NOKIA HAS COMPENSATED FOR SOME OF THE FLAWS AND INADEQUACIES CREATED BY MICROSOFT WITH ITS HARDWARE, EXCLUSIVE APPS(THOUGH HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED,IT SOUNDS PROFESSIONAL ON PAPER) AND PROMPT AND SINCERE SERVICE.
      
      
      I SINCERELY HOPE THAT MICROSOFT DOES NOT LET NOKIA DOWN AND THAT IT REALLY BEHAVES LIKE A 3RD BIGGEST MOBILE PLATFORM, BY RECTIFYING ITS FLAWS BY GIVING IMMEDIATE UPDATES."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"USER EXPERIENCE AFTER 3 WEEKS OF USE.
      
      ALTHOUGH INBUILT STORAGE IS STATED TO BE 8 GB, ONLY 4.8 GB REMAINS TO BE USED, THE REST IS CONSUMED BY THE SYSTEM APPLICATIONS. THE DRAWBACK LIES IN THE FACT THAT ALL DOWNLOADED STUFFS CAN'T BE MOVED TO THE SD CARD, EXCEPT FOR THE PHOTOS AND MUSIC. BUT THEN, THE APPS ARE NICELY SQUEEZED TO MAKE IT SPACE FRIENDLY. MOST MARKETPLACE APPS USE &GT;2 MB OF SPACE.
      
      THE CAMERA PART IS SPECTACULAR, AND DRAWS NO COMPARISION TO OTHR PHONES IN THIS PRICE BRACKET. AND NEEDLESS TO SAY UI, IS SUPERB.
      
      COMING TO APPS, THE WINDOWS MKT SERUOUSLY NEEDS TO GROW. EVEN A DESCENT FB APP IS MISSING. THIS IS ONE ASPECT THAT COMPARED TO ANDROUD, MAKES U CRIPPLED AND LIMITED.
      
      BATTRY BACK UP IS SOLID AND NVR LETS U DOWN."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,WHEN SIM IS INSERTED MAPS WILL WORK ONLY FOR THIS HOME COUNTRY AS PART OF THE LICENSE. EVEN IF U INSERT ANOTHER COUNTRY SIM IT WONT SHOW UP FOR OTHER COUNTRY NAVIGATION. THIS IS THE MOST FLIPSIDE AND YOU WILL NEVER REALISE UNLESS U MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY HOPING THIS WILL WORK.
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"WHY DID I BUY LUMIA 720:
      
      
      1. SAMSUNG, NO THANKS! EVERYONE AROUND HAS ONE. NOTE, S4, S2, S3, DUOS, GRAND... AND EVERY HANDSET LOOKS SAME. WAS GETTING SICK.
      
      2. ANDROID, NO AGAIN! EVERY HANDSET (NOT SAMSUNG ONLY) LOOKS SAME!
      
      3. AT THIS PRICE: SONY WEAK BATTERY, LG AND HTC POOR POST-SERVICING, OTHERS NOT WORTH IT.
      
      4. LOOKS. DROP DEAD SLEEK. ONLY HANDSET UNDER 25K LOOKS COMES CLOSE TO IT IS S2. LG L9 RUINED IT WITH PLASTIC CASING. XPERIAS ARE GOOD ONLY BEYOND 25000. METAL FINISHING LOOKS TERRIFIC.
      
      
      WHAT DID I GET EXTRA:
      
      1. GORRILA GLASS 2. MEANS NO WEIRD CASING IS NEEDED.
      
      2. 2000 MAH BATTERY. NO WORRIES FOR 1.5 DAYS AT LEAST EVEN WITH MODERATE USE.
      
      3. STURDY PHONE. REMEMBER NOKIA 1100???
      
      4. UNLIMITED FREE SONGS, ANY SONG. SONGS HARD TO FIND IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN NOKIA MUSIC STORE. DOWNLOAD IT, KEEP IT. I AM PLANNING TO BUILD A GOOD COLLECTION.
      
      5. HERE DRIVE AND HERE MAPS. YOU HAVE TO USE IT TO KNOW HOW GOOD THEY ARE. OR YOU CAN DOWNLOAD GOOGLE MAPS TOO IF YOU PREFER IT. SATNAV AND OFFLINE MAPS ARE AMAZING FEATURES.
      
      
      WHAT I DID NOT GET:
      
      1. DECENT EARPHONE. BAKWAAS!
      
      2. SOME APPS. CHALEGA.
      
      3. 1 GB RAM. (STILL PLAYING GAMES, ARE YOU?)
      
      4. FM
      
      5. DECENT MUSIC PLAYER. (BOO...)
      
      
      ANYWAY I LIKE MY MOBILE SO MUCH THAT I COULD EVEN IMPRESS MY PARENTS WITH IT...."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"WITHIN TWO DAYS OF ORDERING FROM FLIPKART.
      
      
      MATT FINISH. RED IS NOT AS DARK AS SHOWN IN THE PIC, ITS MORE ORANGISH RED. WHICH I WAS NOT TOO PLEASED ABOUT BUT STILL LOOKS GREAT
      
      BUT IT FEELS STRONG AND IS LIGHT.
      
      
      I HAVE NOT YET USED IT SO WILL UPDATE WITH MORE DETAILS LATER"
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"WRITING MY FEEDBACK AFTER USING MY LUMIA 720 FOR 3 WEEKS NOW. OVERALL ITS ABOVE AVERAGE.
      
      WHAT I LIKE
      
      - AWESOME BUILD QUALITY. GREAT LOOKS.. MINE IS RED N LOOKS CHICK...
      
      - SUPERB BATTERY LIFE.. WAS ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR ME TO SELECT THIS ONE.. IT GIVE ME MORE THAN 2 DAYS ON SINGLE CHARGE WITH WIFI ON FOR 6-7 HRS WHEN I,M AT HOME N ON 3G WHEN I,M OUTSIDE. 5 STARS JUST FOR THE BATTERY PERFORMANCE.
      
      - PERFORMANCE.. ITS BUTTERY SMOOTH.. VERY FLUID... NO LAGS.. NO CRASH SO FAR.. EXCELLENT N DELIVERS WHATS PROMISED. THUMBS UP.
      
      - SCREEN IS JUST BEAUTIFUL.
      
      - THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH WINDOWS PHONE N I LIKE IT SO FAR.. LOVE THE SIMPLICITY OF IT.
      
      - SOCIAL INTEGRATION IS PERFECT. I DOWNLOADED THE FACEBOOK APP BY MICROSOFT BUT HARDLY USE IT AS THE PEOPLE INTEGRATION DOES ITS JOB.
      
      - CAMERA IS GREAT..  ALL THE IN BUILT APPS N LENSES  FOR IT ARE GOOD... 9 ON 10 FOR CAMERA.
      
      - CALL QUALITY IS VERY GOOD
      
      - SPEAKER OUTPUT IS GOOD
      
      
      WHAT I DONT LIKE OR COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER...
      
      THE HANDSFREE THAT WAS PART OF THE BUNDLE IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS..  I CANT RECEIVE CALLS WITH IT IF I,M DRIVING,.. SO WASTE... BUYING ANOTHER ORIGINAL NOKIA HANDSFREE FOR IT IS ALSO COSTLY... HAVING TOUGH TIME FINDING COMPATIBLE ACCESSORIES FOR IT LIKE A DECENT HANDSFREE ETC.
      
      
      VOLUME CONTROL IS IRRITATING.. IF I CHANGE ONCE IT CHANGES EVERYWHERE INCLUDING ALARMS ETC.. BIG LET DOWN..
      
      NO ASCENDING RINGER... NO PROXIMITY SENSOR THAT COULD CONTROL THE VOLUME LEVELS WHEN YOU REACH OUT TO YOUR HANDSET..
      
      TO RECEIVE CALL I MUST SLIDE UP AND THEN RECEIVE CALL... NOT SMART ENOUGH FOR A SMART  PHONE.  WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE OR REJECT CALLS FROM LOCK SCREEN ITSELF , NO?!
      
      DIAL PAD DOESNT ALLOW ME TO EDIT NUMBER BEFORE I DIAL IN.. AGAIN VERY IRRITATING...
      
      
      ALL THESE SMALL POINTS STOP ME FROM SAYING THAT ITS A GREAT ""SMART"" PHONE.. CAUSE THERE ARE HARDLY ANY SMART THINGS THAT THIS OR A WINDOWS PHONE DOES..
      
      
      THESE ARE THE MOMENTS WHEN I MISS MY ANDRIOD.. HTC.. N STOP ME FROM RECOMMENDING IT TO ANYONE...
      
      
      OVERALL, I,M HAPPY WITH IT AS IT MEETS MY TOP REQUIREMENTS IN A PHONE, BUILD, PERFORMANCE, BATTERY, CALL QUALITY ETC..
      
      
      GO FOR IT.. IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET USED TO THE WINDOWS INTERFACE BUT AFTERWARDS, YOU ENJOY THE SIMPLICITY OF IT..  NOKIA HAS DELIVERED WELL WITH THIS ONE...
      
      
      HOPE WINDOWS OS GETS SMARTER WITH COMING VERSIONS..."
Nokia Lumia 720,4,"YES VIDEO SHARING WORKS IN WP8..... I HAVE LUMIA 620 AND I HAVE SENT A RECORDED VIDEO VIA BLUETOOTH, SINCE IT WORKS ON LUMIA 620 IT MUST WORK IN LUMIA 720 TOO...... ALSO YOU NEED TO SWITCH ON BLUETOOTH BEFORE SHARING"
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"1.BATTERY : GOOD FOR ONE DAY AND A BIT MORE. BUT NOT GOOD FOR 2 DAYS AS EVERYONE IS GUESSING IT TO BE. 4/5
      
      2.LOOKS: KILLER. BETTER THAN ALL THE PREMIUM PHONES EXCEPT XPERIA Z, IPHONE 5, AND A COUPLE OF HTC PREMIUM PHONES. EASILY BEATS ANY SAMSUNG FLAGSHIP OR EVEN NOKIA 920 IN LOOKS. 5/5
      
      3.OS PERFORMANCE: HONESTLY ALL THESE TALKS OF NO HANGING IN WINDOWS IS BS IN MY OPINION, AS THIS PHONE DOESN'T HANG BUT LAGS IN ALMOST EVERY ACTIVITY. NOTHING IS LIKE THAT YOU TOUCHED IT AND IT OPENED IN A BLINK. 2.5/5
      
      4.TOUCH: IS NOT VERY SMOOTH. NOT BAD EITHER. JUST NOT AS GOOD AS AN ANDROID AT THIS RANGE. 3/5
      
      SCREEN: NOKIA HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AT KEEPING IT LIVELY WITH GOOD BRIGHTNESS AND CLEAR BLACK, BUT STILL RESOLUTION IS A BUMMER IN VIDEOS. 2.5/5
      
      5.CAMERA:IS JUST AS AWESOME AS IT GETS IN 6.7 MP. ENOUGH SAID. 5/5
      
      6.MUSIC PLAYBACK: IS A PAIN IN THE ARSE. MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE HAS FACED THE PROBLEM OF DUPLICATION OF THE TRACKS IN THE PLAYLIST WONDER HOW NO ONE COMPLAINED FOR IT HERE. MUSIC APP NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED FOR SURE. FREE NOKIA MUSIC IS GREAT BUT UNLESS AN UPDATE SORTS OUT THE PLAYER IT'S MORE OR LESS USELESS. 1/5
      
      7.MAPS AND NAVIGATION: FEATURES ARE AWESOME, WORK EVEN WITHOUT INTERNET! COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR MORE IN THIS! 5/5
      
      8.APPS: I DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING HERE. EVERYONE KNOWS. 2/5
      
      9. CALL: CLARITY IS GOOD. 4/5
      
      10. MISC: PHONE HEATS UP ON CONTINUOUS MAPS/NAVIGATION, 3G, GAMES USAGES. INTEGRATION OF FACEBOOK IS WONDERFUL ON THIS PHONE, JUST THE APP NEEDS A REVAMP WITH SOME MORE FEATURES. 3/5
      
      
      OVERALL : RATINGS 32/50
      
      DECIDE ACCORDING TO YOUR PRIORITIES. LIKE THE COMMENT TO HELP EVERYONE SEE THIS REVIEW.
      
      CHEERS"
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"512 MB RAM, SO NO TEMPLE RUN AND I THINK MANY OTHER HD GAMES WILL ALSO NOT SUPPORT THIS HANDSET..THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE IS THE WP OS. YOU WILL NOT GET THE LATEST ITERATION OF THE WINDOWS PHONE OS. LIKE OLDER WP DEVICES ARE GETTING ONLY WP 7.8 AND NOT WP 8..WITH ANDROID YOU AT LEAST GET 2/3 UPDATES..AND THERE'S XDA DEVELOPERS FORUM FOR MORE..
      
      
      AND THE LADY WHO SAID ""60% OF ANDROID APPS CAN'T BE USED IN INDIA""-THAT'S A LIE..AND EVEN IF I ""ASSUME"" WE CANT USE 60% OF ANDROID APPS..THERE'S STILL AROUND 300000 APPS AVAILABLE WHICH IS STILL MORE THAN APPS AVAILABLE FOR WP (LOL). THE TRUTH IS ALMOST ALL RENOWNED APPS WHICH ARE FREE OR ADD SUPPORTED IN ANDROID ARE PAID IN WP AND MANY APPS ARE STILL MISSING IN WP..
      
      
      MOST OF THE GAMELOFT TITLES AREN'T AVAILABLE FOR WP. SOME GAMES RUNS BETTER IN IOS BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH WP.
      
      
      IN ANDROID YOU CAN USE LAUNCHERS, WALLPAPERS AND CUSTOMIZE YOUR PHONE THE WAY YOU WANT WITHOUT ROOTING. IN WP8 THE CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS ARE TOO LITTLE.
      
      
      ANDROID IS BETTER THAN WP AT THE MOMENT..AND THAT'S WHY NOKIA IS NOT DOING WELL IN HIGH/MID RANGE MARKET..TRUST ME YOU WILL GET BORED AFTER USING FEW DAYS..WP IS BORING AS HELL.."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"AFTER READING THROUGH COUNTLESS PREVIEWS AND TRACKING THIS PHONE FOR A MONTH BEFORE ITS LAUNCH, I GIFTED MYSELF THIS BEAUTY TWO DAYS POST MY BIRTHDAY. FOR THE FIRST TEN DAYS, THE PHONE WORKED JUST PERFECT. AFTER THAT, I STARTED ENCOUNTERING PROBLEMS LIKE SCREEN FREEZE. THE ONLY SOLUTION, WHICH IS POWER RESET, IS ANNOYING. ALSO, THE PHONE RESTARTS AUTOMATICALLY. MY YOUNGER BRO WAS PLAYING ANGRY BIRDS AND XBOX KEPT SHUTTING AUTOMATICALLY.
      
      
      THE PHONE PROMISES TO KICK SOME SERIOUS ASSES OF THE PHONES IN ITS SEGMENT...AND THOSE OF ITS EXPENSIVE COUNTERPARTS TOO. BUT SADLY, THIS STUNNER IS A BIG LET DOWN WHEN IT COMES TO ITS FAULTS. I HAVE READ SIMILAR COMPLAINS FROM OTHER LUMIA 720 USERS TOO. HOPE NOKIA (OR FLIPKART) DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"AFTER RESEARCH FOR WEEKS AND COMPARISONS BETWEEN ANDROID AND WP I DECIDED TO GO WITH WP. I HAD LUMIA 720 IN MIND CONSIDERING DECENT RAM, PROCESSOR, BEST BATTERY BACKUP OUT OF ALL MID RANGE LUMIAS, BEST CAMERA QUALITY, BEST LOOKS AND ABOVE ALL DECENT PRICE. AFTER RECEIVING IT I USED IT FOR A WHILE, SEARCHED FEW APPLICATION, USED THEM FOUND VERY SMOOTH AND GOOD. IT'S TOO SENSITIVE, EVEN A SLIGHT TOUCH WOULD DO THE WORK. I WAS HAPPY.
      
      THEN LATER ON I THOUGHT OF LOCKING MY PERSONAL PICS AND VIDEOS SO THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS ACCESS TO THOSE. HOWEVER I COULD FIND PHOTO LOCKER BUT NOT THE VIDEO LOCKER. ALL THE LOCKER APPLICATION CAN LOCK VIDEOS ONLY WHEN YOU RECORD THEM THROUGH THAT APP AND THEN LOCK. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOCK ALREADY SAVED VIDEOS. I SEARCHED EVERYWHERE BUT COULDNT FOUND. SOMEWHERE IT WAS WRITTEN THAT DUE TO LIMITATIONS IN WINDOWS 8 WE CANNOT CREATE APPLICATION TO LOCK ALREADY SAVED VIDEOS. I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT. BUT THIS LIMITATION FOR VIDEO GOES ON WITH OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKING APPLICATIONS AS WELL. I AM USING WHATSAPP. I CAN SEND PICS AND RECEIVE PICS FROM OTHER AND SAVE THEM IN MY CELLPHONE. HOWEVER I CANNOT SEND ALREADY SAVED VIDEOS IN MY CELLPHONE. I'LL HAVE TO RECORD AND THEN SEND. ALSO I CAN WATCH RECEIVED VIDEOS (AFTER BUFFERING) BUT CANNOT SAVE IT IN MY CELLPHONE. THE VIDEOS REMAIN IN WHATSAPP SERVER. SO IF YOU WANNA WATCH VIDEOS YOU'LL HAVE TO SCROLL UP THE CONVERSATION TO GO BACK TO VIDEO AND PLAY. THIS REALLY SUCKED. I AGAIN CONFIRMED WITH OTHER CHAT APPLICATION WHICH IS GAINING MOMENTUM..WECHAT. IN THAT ALSO I DONT HAVE OPTION TO SEND ALREADY SAVED VIDEOS. I CAN RECORD AND THEN SEND. WHO THE HELL RECORD AND SEND VIDEO. VERY RARELY. WE GUYS SEND ALL KIND OF ALREADY SAVED SHIT TO EACH OTHER.
      
      ALSO I CANNOT CREATE FOLDER IN THE WP. WE DONT HAVE ANY APPLICATION TO CREATE A FILE MANAGER. THIS SUCKED TOO. (HOWEVER I KNEW IT BEFORE BUYING SO IT DOESNT REALLY MATTER MUCH) THE LIMITATIONS  WITH VIDEO HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY WP. I HAVE NOW REALIZED WHY WP IS LAGGING BEHIND ANDROID.
      
      
      THE GOOD THINGS IN PHONE ARE FROM NOKIA AND NOT MICROSOFT. FOR EXAMPLE THE CAMERA IS AWESOMME WITH CARL ZEISS LENS, GURILLA GLASS TOUCH. YOU CANNOT REMOVE BATTERY, THIS IS SOMEHOW GOOD. IT MAKES YOUR CELLPHONE KIND OF WATERPROOF. FEW DAYS BACK WHEN I WAS HAVING DINNER, THE PHONE SLIPPED THROUGH MY HAND AND FELL INTO A BOWL OF DAAL. IT DID HURT :-( I TOOK IT OUT, WIPED IT WITH WET CLOTH. AFTER SOMETIME I TESTED BY CALLING ON OTHER CELLPHONE, IT WORKED FINE, THE CAMERA IS WORKING FINE TOO. MICROPHONE TOO DIDNT GET AFFECTED.
      
      IF YOU ARE VIVID USER TO SOCIAL SITES AND GAMES THEN DONT EVEN THINK OF BUYING WP. ANDROID WILL REMAIN BEST.
      
      HOWEVER IF YOU WANNA GO WITH BUILD QUALITY, LONGEVITY AND DURABILITY, THEN GO WITH LUMIA 720. IT'S GOOD.
      
      
      TRUST ME, IF NOKIA RESORTS TO ANDROID, THEN NOTHING CAN BEAT NOKIA. I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND, IF HTC CAN DO IT (BUILD WINDOWS PHONE AS WELL AS ANDROID) THEN WHY CAN'T NOKIA. NOKIA HAS TO RETHINK BEFORE IT LOOSES IT MARKET SHARE IN INDIA"
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"ALL CERTIFIED BUYERS, MY FRIENDS WHO ARE GIVING 5 STAR RATING TO THIS MOBILE, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WRITE REVIEWS AFTER 6 MONTH USE OF THIS PHONE, AFTER 6 MONTH YOU WILL EVEN NOT LIKE TO GIVE THIS MOBILE 3 STAR.
      
      
      FOR JUST TO DIAL A NUMBER , USER HAVE TO PRESS SEVERAL TIMES TO REACH CONTACT BOOK , IS THIS OK ? IS THIS FUTURE ? REMEMBER BASIC MOBILE PHONE OF 1000 RS. HAVE FIXED SPEED DIAL FEATURE, BUT THIS CRAP PHONE HAVE NOT.
      
      
      HOW MANY BUCKS COST TO INCLUDE FM RADIO IN MOBILE ?? WHY NOKIA PEOPLE HAVE NOT DONE THAT. YOU WILL SAY ""OH WE DON T NEED FM "", BUT FM IS UPPERMOST NEED IN METRO CITY, YOU GOT ALL NEWS OF YOUR CITY , HUMOUR , EVERY NEW SONG LISTEN WITHOUT MEMORY CARDS SLOT.
      
      
      AND LAST WORST DRAWBACK OF MOBILE IS NON REMOVABLE BATTERY , AFTER 2-3 YEARS BATTERY WILL DRAIN OUT, YOU WILL GO TO NOKIA CARE , THEY WILL CHARGE AROUND AT LEAST 1500 BUCKS."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF HARDWARE BY NOKIA. BUT 512 MB OF RAM LIMITS THE GAMES AVAILABILITY. I READ ONE REVIEW SAYING IPHONE 4S ALSO HAVE ONLY 512MB BUT USE YOUR MIND PEOPLE, IPHONE 4S CAN PLAY ANY GAME AVAILABLE FOR IOS.! PEOPLE MAY DISAGREE WITH ME BUT THE TRUTH IS IT WON'T EVEN RUN TEMPLE RUN. WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR ANY ANDROID PHONE WITH 1GHZ PROCESSOR FOR MORE THAN A YEAR.!
      
      
      LIKE IT OR NOT IT WON'T RUN GAMES."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHETHER THERE IS PROPER BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IN LUMIA720???
      
      I HEARD FROM SOME FRIENS THAT THERE IS NO BLUETOOTH SUPPORT IN LUMIA 720.....IT ONLY HAS NFC...
      
      THAT IS WE CAN ONLY TRANSFER FILES THROUGH NFC....AND NOT THROUGH BLUETOOTH"
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"DEAR ALL, I HAVE PURCHASED THE BLACK COLOUR PIECE OF THIS BRILLIANT PHONE.  I AM IMPRESSED WITH THE CAMERA AND OTHER FEATURES WHICH ALL THE REVIEWS HAVE WRITTEN HERE.  HOWEVER ONE LINE OF CAUTION IS THAT THIS PHONE DOES NOT GIVE YOU VIDEO CALLING FACILITY DIRECTLY FROM MOBILE TO MOBILE ON 3G NETWORK.  THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY OF VIDEO CALLING IS THROUGH SKYPE ACCOUNT.  THIS IS A SERIOUS DRAWBACK OF THIS PHONE AS I HAD ASSUMED THAT THIS FACILITY WOULD BE AVAILABLE AS IN SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB2 OR NEWER SAMSUNG SMARTPHONES.  SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO VIDEO CALLS THROUGH SKYPE THEN AVOID THIS PHONE ALTOGETHER.
      
      FLIPKART DELIVERED THIS TO ME IN 1.5 WORKING DAYS IN MUMBAI. THANKS FOR PROMPT DELIVERIES TO FLIPKART."

      ..................................................................."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"FINALLY EVERYBODY PRAISED THIS PHONE AND YOU WOULD BE TEMPTED TO BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS A GREAT LAUNCH FROM NOKIA BUT JUST NOTE THE BELOW CONS OF THE PHONE AS WELL.
      
      
      1. RAM IS 512MB. THERE ARE NOT MANY GREAT APS AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS 8 TILL NOW. RUNNING HIGH END GAMES WOULD BE A DREAM ON THIS PHONE. FOR EXAMPLE THE RECENTLY RELEASED TEMPLE RUN2 FOR WINDOWS REQUIRE A MINIMUM RAM OF 1GB.
      
      
      2. LOW PIXES DENSITY
      
      
      THE PHONE IS HAVING A PIXEL DENSITY OF 217 WHICH IS SLIGHTLY DISSAPPONTING. ALTHOUGH WIN8 USED LARGE TILE BASED GUI AND IT WONT CREATE MUCH PROBLEM FOR NORMALL USAGE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IT'S YOUNGER AND CHEAPER BROTHER NOKIA 620 GIVES YOU A BETTER PPI OF 246.
      
      
      3. ANTUTU SCORE LESSER THAN NOKIA 620
      
      
      THE PHONE SCORES AN ANTUTU SCORE OF 7343 WHICH IS LESSER THAN NOKIA 620. NOKIA 620 SCORES 9140 WHILE NOKIA 820 SCORES BETTER 11288. THE MORE YOUR SCORE THE BETTER YOUR PROCESSOR EFFICIENT FOR PROCESSING.
      
      
      4. NO FM RADIO. PERSONALLY I DO NOT LISTEN TO FM BUT THIS PHONE DISSAPPOINT THE FM FANS
      
      
      5. AVERAGE AUDIO QUALITY
      
      
      PHONE HAS AVERAGE AUDIO QUALITY AND NOT EVEN COMPARE WITH NOKIA N8 AND NOKIA 808 PHONES.
      
      
      6. CAMERA WITH AVERAGE IMAGE QUALITY.
      
      
      PERHAPS THIS IS THE MOST DISSAPPOINTING THING FROM NOKIA. ALMOST ALL LUMIA SERIES (EXCEPT NOKIA 920) FAILS TO PRODUCE A BETTER IMAGE QUALITY WITH THE CAMERA. IMAGES ARE APPEARED TO BE GRAINY AND NOISY SOMETIMES.
      
      
      ATHOUGH THERE ARE SOME FEW CONS MENTIONED ABOVE THE PHONE SEEMS TO BE A GOOD BUY FOR THE PRICE. HOPE NOKIA CAN PRODUCE MUCH BETTER PHONES IN THE FUTURE."

Nokia Lumia 720,3,"HI,
      
      BROUGHT THIS ONE FOR MY FATHER NEARLY TWO MONTHS AGO.USED IT FOR A MONTH BEFORE PASSING IT ON.THIS PHONE IS REALLY GOOD IF WHAT YOU WANT IS LOOKS AND STABILITY.APP AVAIBILITY IS NOT AN ISSUE AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT A NERD.SCREEN IS GREAT AAND ALL TALKS OF PIXEL DENSITY IS A MEASURE OF THE DUMBNESS OF APPLE FANBOYS(WHICH I AM NOT.I LOVE THE IPOD BUT THAT'S IT.).THE SCREEN IS BRISK AND CLEAR.ONE THING I MISSED WAS A FILE EXPLORER AS IT'S A THING I USE TOO MUCH ON MY NOTE 2. BUT AS IT WAS FOR MY PA, IT DIDNT MATTER WHERE THE FILE WENT AS LONG AS IT WAS AVAILABLE FOR USE.
      
      THE THING IS IF YOU ARE THE SORT OF PERSON WHO LIKES TO INSTALL AND UNINSTALL AND AGAIN REINSTALL THOUSAND OF APPS JUST FOR TRYING THEM OUT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS OR BB FOR NOW.AS ROME WASAN'T BUILT IIN A DAY, YOU CANNOT EXPEXT THE APP STORE TO HAVE MILLIONS OF APP IN A YEAR OF LAUNCH.
      
      BASIC APPS ARE THERE AND THE PHONE IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.BUT JUST BECAUSE I OWN IT DOSENT MEAN A 5 * RATING.

      1&GT; NO FILE MANAGER !!!!
      
      2&GT; BAD PDF SUPPORT, NO WAY TO SAVE AND OPEN PDF.
      
      3&GT; BAD VIDEO PLAY SUPPORT AND MANAGEMENT. PLAYING AND FINDING VIDEOS A PAIN

      HERE I APPRECIATE SERVICE OF FLIPKART. THE GUY ON PHONE HIMSELF ASKED ME TO PACK THE PHONE AND KEEP THAT TILL THEY DELIVER THE NEW PIECE. I HOPE THIS TIME I'LL GET A GOOD ONE.
      
      I'LL RATE IT 3 THIS TIME. POSSIBLY I WILL WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW ONCE I WILL GET NEW ONE, AND YES WORKING ONE.
      
      THIS PHONE CAN NOT BE RESET AS YOU CAN NOT REMOVE BATTERY FROM IT. I THOUGH NOKIA IS BEST FOR H/WS BUT FORGOT THEY ARE USING CHINESE LABOUR FOR ITS MANUFACTURING... SO THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS NOT SURPRISING."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,I HAD BOUGHT LUMIA 720 CYAN 1 MONTH BEFORE. THE FIRST THING I LIKE ABOUT IT IS ITS NICE LOOK. AFTER 1 MONTH OF ITS USAGE I CAN SAY THAT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST SMARTPHONE FOR DAILY USAGE. THE SCREEN GLASS IS AWSOME. ONE OF THE GLITCH I SAW IS ITS KEEP RESTARTING SOMETIME. WHEN I CHECKED IN SOME WINDOWS FORUM AND ALL IT IS MENTIONED LIKE IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR MANY OF THE WINDOWS PHONE.
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR TWO MONTHS NOW AND HARDWARE-WISE IT IS ONE OF THE BEST PHONES UNDER THE 20K RANGE. HERE ARE ITS MAJOR ADVANTAGES:

      + GREAT DISPLAY
      
      + VERY GOOD CAMERA FOR A SMARTPHONE

      WONDER WHY I GAVE THE PHONE ONLY 3 STARS? WELL IT IS BECAUSE THIS PHONE (OR ANY OTHER WINDOWS 8 PHONE FOR THAT MATTER) IS CRIPPLED WITH SOME SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS. LET ME TELL YOU THAT THESE LIMITATIONS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SMALLER WINDOWS APP STORE. THE AVERAGE USER MAY (MORE LIKELY) OR MAY NOT FIND THIS STORE SUFFICIENT BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. RATHER THESE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF THE OS BY ITSELF. THESE ARE:
      
      
      - LACK OF A FILE MANAGER (BY WINDOWS OR ANY OTHER 3RD PARTY DEVELOPER): THIS IS ONE DISADVANTAGE SO HUGE THAT IT CAN EVEN MAKE YOU REGRET BUYING THIS PHONE (OR ANY OTHER WINDOWS 8 PHONE). LACK OF A FILE MANAGER TRANSLATES TO THE FOLLOWING DISADVANTAGES:
      
      
      1. NO WAY OF CREATING/MOVING/RENAMING SUBFOLDERS INSIDE YOUR DOCUMENTS OR MUSIC OR PICTURES FOLDER. IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS NO WAY OF ORGANIZING THEM.
      
      
      2. IN FACT THERE IS NO WAY OF EVEN ACCESSING THESE FOLDERS WITHOUT CONNECTING TO A PC WITH THE USB CABLE.
      
      
      SO EVERY TIME YOU NEED TO EVEN RENAME A PDF/MUSIC FILE YOU HAVE TO RUN TO A PC WITH A USB CABLE.
      
      
      3. ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO TRANSFER MUSIC FILES/PDFS/DOCS FROM YOUR PC THROUGH WIFI OR BLUETOOTH. IN ANDROID THERE ARE 3RD PARTY APPS FOR THESE. BUT WINDOWS COMPLETELY RESTRICTS ANY APP FROM EVEN ACCESSING THE MUSIC/DOCS FOLDERS. HENCE WIRELESS TRANSFER IS NOT POSSIBLE. (FOR PDF/DOCS THERE IS AN OPTION TO TRANSFER IT VIA SKYDRIVE BUT THIS REQUIRES INTERNET. EVEN THEN THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR MUSIC FILES.)
      
      
      4. IF YOU READ A LOT (LIKE I DO) AND HAVE SAY 300+ PDFS THERE IS NO WAY OF ORGANIZING THEM IN FOLDERS BY AUTHOR/GENRE ETC. THIS MAKES ACCESSING YOUR EBOOKS (BY SCROLLING THROUGH A LIST OF 300+ PDFS) CLOSE TO IMPOSSIBLE. AGAIN YOU CAN'T RENAME YOUR EBOOKS UNLESS YOU CONNECT TO YOUR PC.
      
      
      5. AS YOU CANNOT ACCESS THESE FOLDERS, YOU CANNOT ATTACH A WORD OR A PDF FILE IN YOUR EMAIL. IN FACT YOU CAN ATTACH ONLY IMAGE FILES.
      
      
      TO SUMMARIZE, THIS PHONE (OR ANY OTHER WINDOWS 8 PHONE) SIMPLY CEASES TO BE 'SMART' WITHOUT A SUPPORTING PC AND A USB CABLE AND THAT IS NOT HOW A SMARTPHONE WAS INTENDED TO BE.
      
      
      - INABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE AND MICROMANAGE SETTINGS AND FEATURES: THIS IS NOT AS BIG A DISADVANTAGE AS THE PREVIOUS ONE BUT IT DOES PRESENT A GOOD NUMBER OF PROBLEMS. SOME OF THEM ARE:
      
      
      1. YOU CANNOT SET DIFFERENT VOLUME LEVELS FOR ALARM, RINGTONE AND MUSIC. THERE IS JUST THIS ONE UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL. SO SUPPOSE YOU REDUCED THE VOLUME LEVEL WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC AND FORGOT TO TURN IT BACK TO HIGH, CHANCES ARE THAT YOU WON'T NOTICE YOUR PHONE RINGING IN THE NEXT ROOM OR YOU WON'T BE WOKEN UP BY YOUR ALARM THE NEXT DAY.
      
      
      2. YOU CAN'T CUSTOMIZE THE APPEARANCE OF YOUR START SCREEN VERY MUCH. NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME AS I FIND THE DEFAULT ONE VERY PLEASING.
      
      
      SO TO SUM UP, IF YOU ARE SURE THAT THESE SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS WILL NOT AFFECT OR BRING DOWN YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH AN OTHERWISE FANTASTIC SMARTPHONE THEN GO FOR IT. IF YOU EVEN HAVE THE SMALLEST DOUBT GO FOR AN ANDROID INSTEAD, BECAUSE TRUST ME YOU WILL REGRET AFTERWARDS."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"I HAVE PURCHASE THIS MOBILES LAST WEEK AND I REALLY DISAPPOINTING WITH THE OS. THE HARDWARE QUALITY IS GREAT, LOOKS AWESOME BUT WINDOWS 8 NOT HAS BASIC FEATURES AND OPTIONS EVEN IN COMPARISON WITH SYMBIAN.
      
      
      I THING MICROSOFT MUST HAVE TO LOOK AFTER THE OS PART AND MAKE IT USER FRIENDLY.
      
      
      AWAITING UPDATES ON WINDOWS 8 OS."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,IF YOU ARE SO CARELESS PLEASE DNT BUY THIS PHONE .DROP THE PHONE REPLACE THE TOUCH PANEL.THE REPLACEMENT COMES AT A COST OF SOMEWHERE AROUND 3K.
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"IM USING THIS PHONE SINCE 2 MONTHS. IM FACING A DIFFICULT ISSUE. THIS PHONE WILL HANG UNEXPECTEDLY. U CANT DO ANYTHING EXCEPT HARD RESET UR DEVICE. UNTILL UNLESS THERE IS AN UPDATE FROM WINDOWS, IT WONT BE FIXED. SO.., THIS PHONE IS CLEAN. BUT., WINDOWS OS IS NOT UPTO THE MARK AS EXPECTED."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"ITS BEEN 9 DAYS NOW I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE.
      
      
      ALL IT LACKS IS...BATTERY, IT DOES NOT STAY LONG AS PROMISED BY NOKIA. INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BECAUSE OF 2G INTERNET RUNNING AT THE BACK GROUND, BUT IT STILL GOES DOWN THOUGH I TURNED IT OFF. MAXIMUM IT CAN HOLD FOR IS 10 HOURS WITH AN AVERAGE TALK TIME OF 20 MINS.
      
      
      ANOTHER DRAWBACK-- THE PHONE GETS CAUGHT BY HEAT IF YOUR CALL PROLONGS FOR MORE THEN 5-10 MINS.
      
      
      GAMES : YOU CANNOT RUN TEMPLE RUN ON THIS DUE TO JUST 512 MB RAM. FOR THIS PRICE NOKIA SHOULD HAVE AFFORDED 1GB...NOT SURE WHY IT WENT DOWN HERE."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"LUMIA 720 IS GOOD IN DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY..THE MAIN DRAWBACK IS,IT GETS STUCK UP IF I TRY TO PLAY MUSIC.AND THE MUSIC PLAYER IS VERY BAD. THERES LOT OF FEAUTURES MISSING.A DEVICE WITH THE PRICE TAG OF 18K COMES WITH ONLY 512RAM...THATS REALLY DISAPPOINTING WHILE OTHER BRANDS ARE OFFERING 1GB OF RAM BELOW 18K RANGE...NOKIA HAS TO PUT IN A LOT...."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"LUMIA 720 IS GOOD PHONE IN LOOKS AND COMFORT.

      1.LUMIA 720 IS NOT ABLE TO POWEROFF,IT RESTARTS AGAIN ITSELF.

      THE PHONE HUNG WHILE USING WHATSAPP. I AM NOT ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE BLUE TOOTH.

Nokia Lumia 720,3,"PAYING 18.5 K BUCKS, PHONE DOESN'T SUPPORT RED EYE REDUCTION, THEN WHAT IS USE OF CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS WITH  6.7 MEGAPIXEL PRIMARY CAMERA. REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH FEATURES AND SOME OF APPLICATION LIKE WHATS APP, FACEBOOK AND GAMES AND RINGTONE IS SYNC WITH MUSIC AND VIDEO PLAYER, IF VIDEO PLAYER IS KEPT ON MUTE WHEN CALLS COME IT WON'T RINGS, THIS REALLY PATHETIC .."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"QUESTIONS FROM ALL LUMIA 720 CERTIFIED BUYERS, AS I M TAKING STEP TO BUY THIS PRODUCT, I WILL BE NEEDING SOME USEFUL INFORMATION
      
      
      1) CAN IT BE CHARGED WHILE PHONE IS TURNED OFF?
      
      2) CAN THE ROTATION OF DISPLAY BE CONTROLLED(CAN WE TURN IT ON OR      OFF AS IN ANDROID PHONES)
      
      3) CAN WE DO MULTIPLE TASKS ON IT
      
      4) CAN WE ENABLE OR DISABLE DATA PACKET(INTERNET)
      
      THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING MY DOUBTS INTO CONSIDERATION.. :)
      
      
      PLEASE HELP ME COZ I M GOING TO ORDER ONLY WHEN MY DOUBTS R CLEAR.. THANKS AGAIN"
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"THE PHONE IS REALLY GOOD..
      
      LETS START FROM THE PROCESSOR.
      
      IT IS POWERED BY 1GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR. ITS GOOD. I MEAN REALLY GOOD.
      
      CAMERA: ITS 6.7MP CAMERA IS JUST THE BEST. I  WAS ABLE TO CLICK PICS BETTER THAN THAT ON MY SONY ERRICSON ARC S
      
      OS: THE OS FEELS LIKE USING MY SONY VAIO. ITS EXACTLY THE SAME
      
      THE BIGGEST CON OF THE PHONE IS THAT IT HAS 512MB OF RAM.
      
      THE APPS WHICH ARE RELEASED ARE ALL REQUIRING 1GB OF RAM SO IT CLEARLY MEANS THAT THEY WON'T BE WORKING WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      WHILE THE DEVELOPERS ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE ""WORKING"" ON PROVIDING GAMES FORM 512 MB RAM PHONES, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY ACTUALLY ARE.
      
      IF YOU ARE NOT A GAMER, THEN THIS IS THE PHONE FOR YOU.
      
      CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 IS TOO GOOD AND SO IS THE SENSITIVITY.
      
      JUST A GOOD PHONE. NOT THE BEST.
      
      WINDOWS IS LAGGING BEHIND FROM ANDROID AS THE AMOUNT OF APPS IN 512 MB ARE MASSIVE AS  COMPARED TO NOKIA'S 512 MB RAM GAMES WHICH ARE, UM, A FEW, MAYBE?"
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT WITH GREAT PRICE..
      
      
      LOOKS AWESOME..
      
      
      FEELS AWESOME..
      
      
      TOUCH IS BRILLIANT..
      
      
      SOUND IS BEAUTIFUL..
      
      
      VIBRANT COLOUR..
      
      
      GREAT OUTPUT..
      
      
      AFTER USING TWO WEEKS..
      
      
      CALL QUALITY IS NOT GOOD, MAKES YOUR HEAD PAIN.. VOICE FROM THE SPEAKER OF THE OTHER PERSON IS POOR, DISTORTED.. CANT HOLD UP A CALL FOR MORE THAN 5 MINUTES..
      
      
      NO PROPER CALL LOG, CANT TRACE THE TIME PERIOD OF CALL.
      
      
      MUSIC + VIDEO FEATURES FAILS TO LOWER THE VOLUME OF THE SONG BEING PLAYED.. HAVE TO SWITCH TO NOKIA MUSIC TO LOWER THE VOLUME..
      
      
      NO FILE MANAGER (BIGGEST DRAWBACK)
      
      
      NO .MVK VIDEO FILE SUPPORT.
      
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD AS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT BY NOKIA.. (ESPECIALLY LOW LIGHT IMAGING WITHOUT FLASH..)
      
      
      THERE IS A DELAY OF AAPROX. 2 SEC AFTER PRESSING THE TWO STAGE BUTTON IN CAPTURING A PICTURE FROM CAMERA.... WHICH IS NOT GOOD... THIS CAN MAKES YOU LOSE THE OBJECT OR CAN PRODUCE THE BLUR IMAGE OF THE OBJECT WHICH YOU WANT TO CAPTURE...
      
      
      NOKIA NEEDS TO GIVE US AN UPDATE IN WHICH THESE THINGS SHOULD BE SORT OUT.. ESPECIALLY THE CALL QUALITY FOR WHICH ONE BUYS A MOBILE..."
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"WINDOWS OS, IT'S NICE BUT IT HAS GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THEY EVEN ATTEMPT TO SAY THAT PEOPLE SHOULD REPLACE ANDROID OR IPHONE WITH A WINDOWS PHONE.
      
      
      ITS THE MUCH SMOOTH SYNC OF THIS PHONE TO COMPANY EXCHANGE SERVER, COMPANY CALENDAR ETC, THAT I SELECTED THIS PHONE OVER ANDROID.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      FILE EXPLORER - WHY CANT THEY ADD IT? - IF ANDROID GIVES IT, WHY CANT YOU? I HAVE A CUSTOM RINGTONE WHICH I WANT TO SET AS RINGTONE FOR A CONTACT, ITS THERE ON MY EXISTING MEMORY CARD WHICH I HAVE INSERTED IN THE PHONE BUT THIS STUPID THING WOULDN'T LET ME DO IT. I HAVE TO CONNECT TO A COMPUTER AND THEN COPY THAT FILE TO RINGTONES FOLDER TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE. WHAT A STUPID WAY TO DO IT.
      
      
      AND DON'T TRY TO SELL ME THE IDEA THAT ITS NOT NEEDED. A TYPICAL MICROSOFT WAY, ""PRESENT A BUG AS A FEATURE.""
      
      
      NO TASK MANAGER - I OPENED A MUSIC FILE BY MISTAKE, THERE IS JUST NO WAY TO CLOSE IT. STUPID PAUSE PLAY KEEPS ON APPEARING EVERY TIME I PRESS VOLUME BUTTON.
      
      
      NO TIMER- DON'T TELL TO DOWNLOAD SOME AD-LOADED FREE APP FOR THIS. EVEN MY PREVIOUS WINDOWS 6.1. PHONE HAD THIS APP.
      
      
      NEUTRAL :
      
      
      NO PROFILES - BUT THEN THE VOLUME BUTTON PRESS GIVES OPTION TO SHIFT FROM SILENT TO AUDIBLE MODE - NOT BAD, WILL NEED SOME TIME TO GET ADJUSTED TO IDEA. BUT AGAIN PROFILES IN NICE THING WHERE I CAN EVEN CHANGE BY BACKGROUND, RINGTONES VOLUMES JUST BY CHANGING A SINGLE THING - PROFILE. AND BY THE WAY - WILL I EVER GET MY WISH GRANTED BY ANY PHONE OS? - TO HAVE OPTION TO SET PROFILE TIMINGS? 9:30 AM TO 6:00 PM GO BY DEFAULT ON OFFICE PROFILE WITH SOBER TONES AND NORMAL PROFILE OTHERWISE?
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1. I LIKE THE TILES THING.
      
      2. TOUCH - SMOOTH.
      
      
      I AM HOPING IN THE ATTEMPT TO GAIN THEIR MARKET SHARE AGAIN NOKIA AND WINDOWS PHONE WILL TRY TO IMPROVE AND WE SOON GET FIXES FOR THINGS MISSING.
      
      
      NOKIA WHICH HAD GOT ARROGANT TILL FEW YEARS BACK IS NOW TO GROUND LEVEL WITH ANDROID SUCCESS AND AGAIN CARING FOR CUSTOMER NEEDS. GIVING FREE THINGS LIKE MAPS , SKY-DRIVE. I DEFINITELY LIKE THAT. MAY BE ITS TIME NOKIA DOES THE SAME THING TO SAMSUNG WHO IS GETTING ARROGANT WITH ITS GALAXY RANGE SUCCESS.
      
      
      AT THE END OF IT ALL, ITS THE CUSTOMER WHO GETS BENEFITED. GETTING LOTS OF FEATURES AT AFFORDABLE PRICES, ISN'T IT?"
Nokia Lumia 720,3,"WOW WHAT A MOBILE..!!

Nokia Lumia 720,2,"ALL THE FEATURES IN THIS PHONE ARE GREAT !!!!!!!
      
      
      BUT NEED SOME MORE INNOVATION TO KILL SAMSUNG DOMINANCE IN RS.5599 TO RS.20900 PRICE RANGE MARKET LEADERSHIP.......
      
      
      INDIA IS VERY PRICE SENSITIVE MARKET SO IT ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR MORE FEATURES IN A LOWER PRICE RANGE WITH A QUALITY PERFORMANCE WHICH I THINK SAMSUNG IS SUCCESSFUL IN PAST FEW YEARS.......(SPECIALLY SUCCESSFUL SELL OF SAMSUNG GALAXY Y S5360 , SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS S7562 , SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND DUOS I9082)
      
      
      NOKIA NEEDS TO LAUNCH MORE PRODUCTS ON A MONTHLY BASIS SPECIALLY IN LINE WITH THE COMPETITION TO SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS S7562 (PRICE RANGE BETWEEN 10 K TO 15K)
      
      
      SAMSUNG'S SMART PHONE PROBLEMS ARE : 1) LOWER SCREEN RESOLUTION 2) LOWER CAM QUALITY 3) NO INNOVATION ON LOOKS OF THE PHONE
      
      
      LUMIA ADVANTAGE :
      
      1) GOOD SCREEN RESOLUTION AND VIEWING ANGLES
      
      2) EXCELLENT CAMERA QUALITY AND INNOVATION (PEOPLE LOOKING FOR GOOD CAM PHONE LATEST LUMIA SERIES IS THE BEST ONE I.E. LUMIA 520 ,620,720)
      
      3) EXCELLENT DESIGN AND STYLE
      
      
      WHAT LUMIA 720 SHOULD DO TO KILL SAMSUNG :
      
      
      NEED TO ADD ONE FEATURE I.E. FM WITH RECORDING, FREE BACK COVER (AT LEAST 2 COLORS ) AND PRICING AT RS. 14999
      
      
      THIS SHOULD HAPPEN IN NEXT 2 MONTHS (OR ELSE SAMSUNG WILL HIT THE MARKET WITH NEW INNOVATION WITH THEIR NEW LAUNCHES OF SAMSUNG GALAXY WIN I 8552 AND GALAXY MEGA 5.8 AND 6.3  SERIES)

Nokia Lumia 720,2,BATTERY PERFORMANCE NOT THAT MUCH GOOD..UNLIKE NORMAL NOKIA PHONES LUMINA NOT GIVING GOOD PERFORMANCE AS EXPECTED. BATTERY WORKS AS SAME AS ALL OTHER SMART PHONES...MAX 24 HOURS..ONLY..REMAINING EVERY THING SEEMS GOOD AS I OBSERVED STILL NOW..
Nokia Lumia 720,2,"I BROUGHT THIS MOBILE AND I WAS ENJOYING THE FEATURES, STYLE AND EVERYTHING BUT THAT WAS NOT EVEN FOR 2 DAYS. THE MOBILE BODY IS MOLDED AND UNIQUE SO YOU CANT OPEN LIKE OUR OLD NOKIA PHONE. THE GORILLA GLASS CLARITY IS SUPERB BUT NOT TOUGHEN SO THAT ARE WHAT MY DISPLAY GLASS WAS CRACKED ON MY 3RD DAY OF THE MOBILE I BROUGHT. THE MOBILE WAS DROPPED UNFORTUNATELY BY ME. I WENT TO MANY NOKIA CARE CENTER TO CHANGE THE GLASS, THE MOBILE IS WORKING GOOD BUT THE FRONT GLASS CRACKED IS NOT GOOD TO SEE.BUT TO CHANGE THE TOUCH SCREEN,THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WERE CHARGING 60 PERCENT OF THE MOBILE PRICE TO REPAIR THAT AND IT TAKES 15 DAYS TOO.
      
      
      SO GUYS YOU CAN BUY THIS MOBILE BUT USE IT CAREFULLY. ONCE ITS DROPPED THE WHOLE VALUE OF THE MONEY AND MOBILE IS GONE, NO USE OF REGRETTING."
Nokia Lumia 720,2,"I HAD MADE A PURCHASE OF NOKIA LUMIA 720 ALMOST A MONTH BACK AND HAD A ISSUES WITH THE AUDIO ORT AND IT WAS HANGING AND THIS WAS REPLACED WITH AN OTHER NOKIA LUMIA 720 YESTERDAY I APPRECIATE THAT.
      
      
      BUT THE WORST PART WAS THE MOBILE THAT WAS REPLACED HAS A MAJOR ISSUES LIKE WHEN YOU OPEN AN APPLICATION IT DIRECTLY COMES TO MENU AND TAKES TO THE BING SEARCH ENGINE AND IT CLOSES AND PHONE KEEPS ON VIBRATING FOR NEARLY 20-30 SECONDS.
      
      
      I DOUBT WHETHER THE NOKIA ARE MANUFACTURING THE LOW QUALITY PHONES OR WS RETAIL ARE SELLING THE USED PHONES. I'M REALLY UNHAPPY BY THIS."
Nokia Lumia 720,2,"I HAD NOKIA LUMIA 620 AND I WANT TO WARN THE PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO BUY THIS PHONE..THIS A REVIEW OF A WINDOWS SOFTWARE NOT OF A PHYSICAL REVIEW OF 720.

      1. BUT HERE COMES THE FAULTY OS...FIRST OF ALL THERE IS NO ALL IN ONE STATUS AND NOTIFICATION BAR THROUGH WHICH WE CAN CHECK OUR DAILY APPS..MESSAGES OR CALLS...
      
      
      2. ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH EACH TILE AND THEN RECEIVE THE NOTIFICATIONS..I MISSED SO MANY OF MY CALLS....THERE IS NO LED INDICATOR WHICH ALERTS THE USER ABOUT ITS MISSED NOTIFICATION BARS.
      
      
      3. WHAT THE HELL MICROSOFT WERE THINKING....NO FILE MANAGER...HOW THE HELL WE GONNA ARRANGE AND ACCESS OUR FILES AND KEEP THEM ACCORDING TO OUR DESIRE...THIS IS WHERE WINDOW OS IS FAR FAR FAR FAR BEHIND THE MIGHTY ANDROID...
      
      
      4. THIRDLY FILES RECEIVED THROUGH BLUETOOTH CANT BE ACCESS IMMEDIATELY...ONE HAS TO BE HAVE A DETECTIVE SKILLS IN ORDER TO FIND THE FILE..
      
      
      5.THERE IS NO SHORT CUT APP FOR BRINGING THE SETTINGS PARTS MENU TO THE FRONT...U HAVE TO ALL THE WAY HAVE TO GO TO THE SETTINGS AND THEN DO THE JOB
      
      6.TALKING OF AAP STORE...IT IS 100 % TRUE THAT IT IS ONE OF THE PATHETIC STORE OF ALL TIME...THE GAMES WHICH ARE GREAT ARE PAID AND WHICH ARE FREE...NOT EVEN A SINGLE WHICH WILL INSPIRE UI THE MOST...NO DOUBT THE PERFORMANCE AND CLARITY IS THERE...BUT WHAT WILL I DO WITH THE CLARITY WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO DO....

      4.FOR THIS PHONE ONLY LIMITED NUMBER OF GOOD GAME ARE AVAILABLE LIKE ASSASSINS CREED,
      
      ASPHALT 7 HEAT,FINAL FANTASY BCZ OF  ITS LOW RAM 512MB
      
      5.THE WORST THING IS, FOR PLAYING ANGRY BIRDS WE HAVE TO BUY IT, BUT IN ANDROID ALL PARTS OF ANGRY BIRDS ARE FREE
      
      6.I HAVENT NOTICED ANY SPEED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANDROID AND WINDOWS,AND WINDOWS LAGS SOMETIMES AND SHUTDOWNS SUDDENLY AND RESTARTS
      
      MOREOVER BETTER NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE IF U WANNA BUY ONLY NOKIA THEN GO FOR LUMIA 820 (OR) 920 ITS RAM IS 1GB SO SOME MORE GAMES WILL BE AVAILABLE OR ELSE IF UR A BIG FAN OF GAMES BETTER GO FOR SONY XPERIA L (OR) SONY XPERIA SP ,THESE BOTH PHONES PLAYS ALL GAMES FROM THE STORE"
Nokia Lumia 720,2,"WHEN I TESTED THE DEVICE AT THE LOCAL 'CHROMA', WHAT HAD ME HITCHED TO THIS DEVICE WAS THE ULTRA-SMOOTH TOUCH AND A UI THAT WAS DIFFERENT FROM ANDROID. THE CAMERA WAS SUPER FINE AND SO WAS THE SPEED WITH WHICH I WAS SHIFTING BETWEEN DIFFERENT MENUS. LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT THE DEVICE HAD SOME BASIC FEATURES MISSING WHICH MAKES IT AN UNWORTHY CANDIDATE TO BE CALLED EVEN A COMPETITOR TO ANDROID.
      
      THE PHONE IS SO VERY RIGID AND YOU CANNOT MODULATE IT AS PER YOUR NEEDS. EVEN MY 2 YEARS OLD ANDROID DEVICE HAVING ANDROID 2.1 WAS MORE FLEXIBLE THAN THIS. TO NAME A FEW  -
      
      1) YOU CANNOT SET YOUR OWN MESSAGE TONE OR YOU CANNOT SEPARATE YOUR MESSAGE TONE FROM YOUR WHATSAPP MESSAGE TONE/ GROUP NOTIFICATION TONE ETC.
      
      2) YOU CANNOT ATTACH PHONE VIDEOS OR SONGS ON WHATSAPP OR OTHERWISE.
      
      3) THE VIDEO PLAYER IS VERY BAD AND THERE IS NOT EVEN A SINGLE GOOD OPTION ON THE ALREADY MALNUTRITIONED MS STORE.
      
      4) THE WHATSAPP ON NOKIA SUCKS BIG TIME (CHECK OTHER BLOGS FOR MORE ON THIS)
      
      5) THERE IS NO APP FOR LIVE NEWS FEEDS( A BIG ISSUE).
      
      6) THE APP STORE HAS VERY VERY VERY LIMITED CONTENT.
      
      
      BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. I HAVE ALREADY PUT AN AD ON OLX FOR SELLING THIS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"19K FOR 512MB RAM. I REGRET FOREVER.
      
      ITS JUST FANCY LOOKING PHONE, THATS ALL. WHY THE F--CK 4.3INCH SCREEN MATTERS WHEN INSIDE CHIP IS NOT CAPABLE OF RUNNING FAST GAMES.?? I THINK THESE DAYS ONLY BUDGET PHONES FROM NOKIA ARE ONLY WORTHY PHONES. THE REST ARE CRAP, JUST THE CRAP."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"ALL MY OTHER ORDERS HAVE BEEN SHIPPED QUITE EARLY. EVEN THIS ONE WAS SHIPPED EARLY, BUT IT NEVER ARRIVED.I GOT A VERY GOOD DEAL ON THE MOBILE. OBVIOUSLY ITS A GOOD PRODUCT. BUT BE READY TO GET SHACKLED BY DELIVERY ISSUES LIKE THIS. CUSTOMER SUPPORT KEEPS SAYING 24 - 48 HOURS FOR THE PAST ONE WEEK!! OTHERWISE, FLIPKART IS A GREAT SITE TO BUY THINGS."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"BOUGHT A 720 RECENTLY, RAN FINE FOR A MONTH, AFTER A MONTH HAVING ISSUES SCREEN SENSOR AND HAVING ISSUES WITH BOOTING ALSO. HAD TO VIST NOKIA SERVICE TWICE, THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TELL ME THE EXACT PROBLEM BUT THEY BOOT THE SYSTEM AND GIVE IT."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"BOUGHT IT FROM NOKIA PRIORITY STORE AT SOUTH CITY MALL KOLKATA FOR RS18500 BUT IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER 7DAYS.ITS DISPLAY GONE ,CAN'T DO ANYTHING DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT.COMPLETE WASTAGE OF MONEY.MY FRIEND ALSO BOUGHT LUMIA 520 FROM SAME STORE AND GOT SAME PROBLEM."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"CONSIDERING THE LUMIA 620 &AMP; 520.
      
      THE PRICE IS BIT TO HIGH SINCE ALL THE MAJOR HARWARE ARE SAME AS THESE TWO.
      
      
      YAA BETTER CAMERA AND STUFF YOU'LL SAY BUT 7-8K MORE FOR THIS MINOR THINGS ARE NOT THAT GREAT.
      
      THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IS THE 512MB RAM.
      
      YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF RAM HERE...MAJOR NEW GAMES CAN'T BE PLAYED ON 512 RAM. YOU WON'T FIND TEMPLE RUN ON THE WINDOWS STORE..AND MOST OTHER GOOD GAMES.
      
      IF ONLY IT HAD A 1GB RAM..IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST AWESOME PHONE OF THE YEAR.
      
      
      OTHER THAN THAT THE PHONE ITSELF IS PRETTY COOL. LOOKS ARE JUST GREAT AND AWESOME BATTERY LIFE. THE LOOKS ARE AMAZINGLY AWESOME. I JUST LOVE IT.
      
      
      THAT'S IT THE ONLY CON NOKIA HAS MADE IS THE RAM. I MEAN SCREEN QUALITY AND STUFF DOESN'T MATTER ONCE YOU SEE THE STYLE OVER IT AGAINST LUMIA 620. 620 IS A BIT THICK AND I DON'T LIKE THE SHAPE AS WELL.
      
      
      NOW THE OS.
      
      
      WP8 STILL SUCKS!
      
      THE GOOGLE APPS ARE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
      
      NO YOUTUBE, GOOGLE+, GMAIL APP ETC NOTHING!
      
      I MEAN SERIOUSLY! SOME WILL SAY USE 3RD PARTY ALTERNATIVE'S. WHY WILL I USE SOME CRAPPY APP FOR SOME MOST USED APPS. BESIDES THE SEARCH APP THERE'S NONE OTHER.
      
      YOU CAN IMAGINE THE APP SITUATION HERE...THEY SAY WP HAVE NOW SO MANY APPS NOW. BUT IN REALITY YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. OH YEAH THE WATSPP ALSO IS FULL OF BUGS SO YOU CAN'T USE THAT ONE TOO..AND NO INSTAGRAM AS OF YET :P
      
      
      NO GOOGLE CHROME ALSO.
      
      
      THE UI LOOKS GOOD..AND IS SMOOTH BESIDES THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO THE OS RIGHT NOW.
      
      
      BEFORE BUYING THE PHONE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE SACRIFICES YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE BECAUSE OF THE OS. THERE IS SO MANY THINGS MISSING. AND MICROSOFT DECIDED NOT TO INTEGRATE GOOGLE+ ON THE OS LIKE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER.
      
      
      BUT PEOPLE WILL BUY THESE AWESOME LOOKING PHONES DESPITE HAVING A CRAP OS IN IT..BECAUSE OF NOKIA'S HARDWARE. I JUST LOVE THE DESIGN :*
      
      
      IF YOU ARE A ANDROID AND IOS USER DON'T THINK OF IT AS A SMARTPHONE. AS LONG AS YOU DO THAT YOU WILL BE PRETTY HAPPY WITH THE PHONE.
      
      
      APPS MAKES A PHONE A SMARTPHONE IN MY OPINION..AND THE LACK OF SO MANY ESSENTIAL APP MAKES WP8 STAND WAY DOWN UNDER IOS AND ANDROID."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"DELIVERY BY FLIPKART TOOK ONLY ONE DAY, SO KUDOS TO FK FOR THAT.
      
      NOW FOR THE PHONE:
      
      PROS:
      
      1. A GREAT HARDWARE.
      
      2. BUILD QUALITY THAT SEEMS TO OUTSHINE EVERY PHONE OUT THERE. TYPICAL OF WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM NOKIA GUYS.
      
      3. GREAT USER INTERFACE. A GREAT RELIEF FROM THE USUAL GRID-APP-CENTRIC LAYOUT OF APPLE/ANDROID DEVICES.
      
      4. DECENT CAMERA. WITH APPS LIKE PHOTO-SYNTH AND A COOL SNAPPER LIKE THIS, IT ALMOST OUTSHINES ALL THE MOBILES IN THIS PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      1. THE WINDOWS OS SYSTEM IS VERY-VERY LIMITING:
      
      A. YOU CAN'T MAKE ANY OF THE SONGS IN YOUR PHONE AS YOUR RINGTONE. TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO CONNECT IT TO YOUR COMPUTER AND THEN TRANSFER THE SONGS IN THE RINGTONE FOLDER AND THEN THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS TO THE FILES THAT YOU CAN TRANSFER.
      
      B. YOU CAN'T SEND PERSONAL DOCUMENTS/BOOKS ON THE KINDLE APP. IN ANDROID YOU CAN.
      
      C. PHOTOS IN EMAILS DO NOT APPEAR AUTOMATICALLY AND SOMETIMES FAIL TO LOAD EVEN AFTER CLICKING DOWNLOAD BUTTON.
      
      D. YOU CANT SHARE SONGS VIA BLUETOOTH.
      
      E. YOU CANNOT MAKE A PLAYLIST OF YOUR SONGS. EVEN MY E63 COULD DO A BETTER JOB.
      
      F. THERE ARE ONLY 3 BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS.
      
      G. IF YOU REDUCE THE SOUND IN SONG/VIDEO PLAYER THE SOUND OF THE WHOLE PHONE REDUCES AS WELL. THERE ARE NO SEPARATE SETTINGS FOR BOTH.
      
      H. LACK OF APPS. EVEN DROPBOX DOESN'T HAVE ITS OFFICIAL APP FOR WINDOWS YET. AND MOST OF THE APPS ARE PAID, EVEN ANGRY BIRDS.
      
      G. KEYBOARD IS NOT AS INTUITIVE AS IT IS FOR ANDROID.
      
      
      2. THE PHONE RESTARTS ON ITS OWN EVERY OTHER DAY.
      
      3. HEATS UP A LOT WHILE DOWNLOADING ANYTHING.
      
      4. BATTERY BACKUP IS PATHETIC TO SAY THE LEAST.
      
      
      CONCLUSION: I AM PRETTY MUCH SURE THAT ITS NOT NOKIA'S FAULT THAT THE DEVICE IS SO BAD.
      
      TO PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT ANDROID LAGS: MY HTC EXPLORER WHICH HAD A 600 MHZ PROCESSOR NEVER HUNG UP. ONE ONLY NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO STOP THE BACKGROUND APPLICATIONS AND ANY PERSON WHO HAS AN IQ OF OVER 100 CAN DO IT EASILY.
      
      IT'S A GOOD TRY BY NOKIA, BUT MS WINDOWS 8 IS A FAR CRY FROM ANDROID. AVOID THIS PRODUCT. SAVE UP A FEW MORE THOUSANDS AND BUY A DECENT ANDROID PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"FEW PROBEM WHICH I FACED:
      
      1. VOLUME KEY DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY
      
      2. WHATS APP - DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY
      
      3. GETS HANG UNLIMITED TIMES
      
      4. LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST  - STARTED VIBRATING SUDDENLY, WHICH WAS UNSTOPPABLE RESULTING IN DRAINING OFF THE BATTERY. LATER WHEN I TRIED RESTARTING THE CELL IT WAS NOT GETTING CHARGED - ACTING AS A DEAD PHONE. NOTHING IS WORKING - NOT EVEN SOFT RESET OR HARD RESET. MY CELL IS NOT EVEN 2 MONTH OLD.  NOT EVEN GETTING REPLACEMENT :( . NOW TRYING TO GET IT FIXED FROM NOKIA CARE.
      
      
      I REGRET THE DECISION OF GETTING LUMIA. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"FLIPKART HAS THE BEST DELIVERY RATE AND PROMPTNESS FOR PRODUCTS.. ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.. HOWEVER, JUST FIGURED OUT THAT BUYING A PRODUCT ONLINE MEANS YOU GET ABSOLUTELY NO HELP FROM ACTUAL SERVICE CENTRES/GALLERIES FOR THAT PRODUCT. SO FAR FLIPKART HAS BEEN VERY PROMPT WITH ANY ISSUES I HAVE HAD BUT THIS PRODUCT SEEMS JINXED. RIGHT FROM THE TIME WHEN I PLACED MY ORDER, I'VE HAD ISSUES. MY ORDER GOT CANCELLED EVEN AFTER CONFIRMING THE PURCHASE WITH FLIPKART. HAD TO DO 2-3 BACK AND FORTH CALLS BEFORE MY PURCHASE WENT THROUGH FINALLY.
      
      
      THE LUMIA HAS BEEN A HUGE LET DOWN FOR ME. IT HANGS, IS SUPER SLOW, GLITCHES WHEN I TRY TO SYNC MY MAILS AND HAS THE WORST BATTERY IVE EVER HAD ON A PHONE. WITH ONLY MAIL AND WHATSAPP AND LIMITED PHONE CALLING THE BATTERY STRUGGLES THROUGH HALF A DAY. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.
      
      
      VISITED NOKIA GALLERIES AND STORES WITH LUMIA HELP-DESKS AND THEY ALL SAID THAT SINCE THIS PRODUCT IS BOUGHT ONLINE, ESSENTIALLY NOT FROM THEM, THEY CANNOT OR WILL NOT HELP WITH WHY IT IS WORKING THE WAY IT IS.

Nokia Lumia 720,1,"HI,
      
      
      I BOUGHT NOKIA LUMIA ON 07TH MAY 2013. THE FIRST PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED IN 5 DAYS OF BUYING WAS IT GOT STUCK AND REMAIN DEAD FOR 15 MINS AND AFTER THAT IT RESTARTED AND WORKING FINE. THIS WAS A CONTINUOUS PROBLEM.
      
      
      THEN ON 18TH JUNE 2013 MORNING, AFTER STOPPING THE ALARM, IT STARTED VIBRATING AND THE VIBRATION DID NOT STOP EVEN AFTER SWITCHING THE PHONE DOWN. THEN IT BECAME PERMANENTLY DEAD. I SUBMITTED THE PHONE IN NOKIA CARE ON 19TH JUNE 2013. THE PEOPLE ON NOKIA CARE TOLD ME THAT THE PHONE HAS BEEN SENT FROM JAIPUR TO NOIDA STATING IT NEEDS REPAIR AND IT CAN BE REPAIRED FROM THERE ITSELF.
      
      
      NOKIA LUMIA 720 IS A PATHETIC DEVICE. I WASTED MY 18 GRANDS FOR THIS GOOD FOR NOTHING PRODUCT. THE CURRENT STATUS IS THAT THE PHONE IS BEING SENT TO NOIDA AND IS BEING WORKED ON IT. I AM SKEPTICAL THAT IT WILL BE WORKING FINE.
      
      
      NOKIA HAS QUALITY CHECKS, SIX SIGMA TECHNOLOGY TO ASSESS KAIZEN, MUDAS ETC RELATED TO THE PRODUCT. ANY DEFECTED PIECE IN THE MARKET CLEARLY SIGNIFIES THAT THE EITHER THE PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT OR THE QUALITY DEPARTMENT IS NOT SENSITIVE TOWARDS THE CUSTOMERS THEY ARE SERVING.
      
      
      FOR THE FIRST TIME, I HAVE TO SAY THAT NOKIA IS PATHETIC AND ITS NOT WORTH BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS.
      
      
      IF THE NOKIA CARE IS NOT ABLE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE, THEN I WOULD ESCALATE THE MATTER TO THE CONSUMER FORUM AS I AM LEFT WITH NO CHOICE.
      
      
      PLEASE IF YOU STILL GO FOR THIS PRODUCT, KINDLY ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCT DESIGN, HARDWARE, SOFTWARES ARE UPTO THE MARK OR NOT.
      
      
      THANKS."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM NOKIA PRIORITY,PIMPRI,PUNE AT RS.17600. FLIPKART YOU HAVE BECOME VERY GREEDY.
      
      JUST AFTER 3 WEEKS MY PHONE IS HANG AND IT NEED TO BE RESTARTED.
      
      AS YOU KNOW WE CANNOT REMOVE ITS BATTERY SO I CANNOT RESTART IT. I HAVE TO TAKE THIS MOBILE TO THE STORE BUT BECAUSE OF LBT(LOCAL BODY TAX) ALL THE SHOPS ARE CLOSED AND ITS 3RD DAY MY PHONE IS STILL IN HANG STATE AND I CANNOT RESTART IT. SO EVERY TIME THIS PHONE HANGS I WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT TO STORE.
      
      
      ALSO THERE IS BUG IN THE SOFTWARE AND NOBODY MENTIONED IT BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS PHONE :( .
      
      SOMETIMES MUSIC PLAYER VOLUME REMAINS FIXED.IN THAT CASE YOU DONT HAVE ANY OTHER OPTION THAN RESTARTING THE PHONE. **** YOU WINDOWS PHONE.
      
      THIS OS IS VERY(N TIMES) IMMATURE. I DONT KNOW HOW CAN WINDOWS PHONE IS GOING TO RULE MARKET IN NEAR FUTURE.
      
      
      BUY THIS PHONE IF THE MOBILE REPAIRING STORE IS AT WALKABLE DISTANCE FROM YOUR HOME. THIS MOBILE PHONE IS NOT EXCEPTIONAL AND IT WILL HANG ONE DAY."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"I HAD PLANNED TO BUY THIS PHONE AS SOON AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY NOKIA . I WAS EXCITED TO BUY THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF ITS ATTRACTIVE LOOKS , DECENT SPECIFICATIONS, GOOD BATTERY AND AN IMPRESSIVE CAMERA AS PER THE REVIEWS GIVEN BY SEVERAL EXPERTS. SO I SOLD MY GALAXY S2 WHICH I USED IT FOR 1.5 YEARS WITH LOT OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH ANDROID , BRICKED THE MOTHERBOARD :P AFTER ROOTING AND GOT IT REPLACED. ORDERED THE LUMIA 720 ON 6TH JUNE AND GOT IT DELIVERED ON 8TH JUNE (GOOD SERVICE BY FLIPKART). INITIAL 2 WEEKS PHONE WORKED FABULOUSLY , EXCELLENT BATTERY LIFE, DECENT PERFORMANCE ETC ETC. BUT IN THE 3RD WEEK PROBLEMS STARTED TO ARISE,LIKE
      
      1. GETTING HUNG WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC ,TILL I HAD TO SOFT RESET IT
      
      2.  STARTED TO VIBRATE CONTINOUSLY WITHOUT ANY REASON , UNTIL SOFT RESET
      
      3. SUDDEN DROP IN BATTERY LIFE , SO I HAD TO HARD RESET IT.
      
      ONE FINE NIGHT THE PHONE STARTED TO VIBRATE CONTINOUSLY FOR MORE THAN 1 HOUR WHILE I WAS ASLEEP, IT WAS VIBRATING EVEN WHEN I SWITCHED IT OFF!!!  THEN I DID A SOFT RESET , EVEN THEN IT DIDNT STOP. FINALLY I HAD TO DO HARD RESET TO STOP IT .
      
      SO I COMPLAINED TO FLIPKART ON 4TH JULY AND THEY AGREED FOR REFUND AS CYAN COLOUR WAS OUT OF STOCK, BUT AFTER FEW DAYS WHEN THE STOCKS ARRIVED THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT. I GOT THE REPLACEMENT ON 15TH JULY EVENING(BRAND NEW ONE ..... AS PER FLIPKART). ONE WHOLE DAY ITS WAS ALRIGHT. NEXT DAY (17TH JULY) MORNING , AFTER I SWITCHED ALARM OFF IN PHONE , GOT FRESHENED UP AND WHEN I CAME BACK AFTER 15MIN PHONE WAS DEAD !!!!!!!!!!!! NO RESPONSE AT ALL !!!!! . EVEN AFTER I TRIED SOFT RESET , HARD RESET AND TRIED CHARGING BUT NO RESPONSE AT ALL !!!! I CALLED FLIPKART AT THAT MOMENT AND FILED A COMPLAINED , THEY HAVE AGREED FOR A REFUND AFTER THEIR TECHNICAL TEAM VERIFY THE COMPLAINT . WHOM SHOULD I BLAME ????????????? FLIPKART OR NOKIA ?????? TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED"
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"I HATE NEITHER  WINDOWS 8 NOR NOKIA. BUT I REALLY DO HATE THEIR COMBINATION - NOKIA LUMIA 720. I OWN THIS PHONE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH AND NOW I REALLY WANT TO GET RID OF THIS. I WANT TO DICUSS ONLY THE CONS OF THIS PHONE, AS ALL THE PROS (IF THERE IS ANY) WILL BE IGNORED WITH THE INTENSITY OF THE CONS.
      
      
      1. NO DEDICATED FOLDER STRUCTURE. NOTHING LIKE A ""GALLERY"" OR ""MY FILES"". SO THERE IS NO QUESTION OF COPYING FILES FROM ONE FOLDER TO ANOTHER BECAUSE THERE IS NO FOLDER AT ALL.
      
      
      2. ITS TRUE THAN YOU CAN USE A EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD. BUT THE ONLY ACTION YOU CAN PERFORM ON THE FILES IN YOUR MEMORY CARD IS DELETE. NO COPY , PASTE OR EVEN ""RENAME"". IF YOU HAVE TO DO ANY OF THESE YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THE PHONE TO A COMPUTER.
      
      
      3. YES, BLUETOOTH IS THERE. BUT YOU CANNOT RENAME YOUR BLUETOOTH. OK FINE. WHAT IS THERE IN A NAME! BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FILES YOU RECIEVE VIA BLUETOOTH. IF YOU ARE LUCKY, YOU WILL FIND THEM IN YOUR ""SAVED PICTURES"" . BUT IN MOST THE CASES YOU WONT SEE YOUR RECIEVED FILES AT ALL.
      
      
      4. YOU CANT DOWNLOAD A VIDEO FILE. ITS TRUE THAT THERE ARE YOU TUBE DOWNLOADER APPLICATIONS. BUT YOU CAN VIEW THESE VIDEOS ONLY WITHIN THESE APLLICATIONS . YOU CANT SAVE THEM TO YOUR SD CARD. SOME MAY ASK WHAT IS THE BIG ISSUE IN IT. BUT GUYS, THESE VIDEO APPLICATIONS USE THE PHONE'S INTERNAL STORAGE MEMORY AND EVENTUALLY THE PHONE BEGINS TO HANG.
      
      
      5. THE MOST FUNNY THING I FOUND IN THIS PHONE IS ""FILE MULTIPLICATION"". SUPPOSE YOU TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OR DOWNLAODED A MUSIC FILE TODAY. TOMMORROW YOU CAN SEE 2 COPIES
      
      OF IT IN YOUR PHONE. THE NEXT DAY 3, THEN 4 AND SO ON. BUT IF YOU DELETE ANY ONE OF THESE, ALL WILL BE GONE DONT THINK THAT ANY VIRUS HAS AFFECTED MY PHONE. BACUSE FORM DAY 1 ITS SO.
      
      
      (COMBINING POINTS 4 AND 5 TOGETHER AND A PREVIOUS COMMENT. SOMEBODY SAID ITS POSSIBLE TO DOWNLOAD VIDEOS USING UC BROWSER. FIRST THING , UC BROWSER FOR WINDOWS ITSELF IS A PIECE OF SHIT. IT HANGS EVERY 1 MINUTE. SECOND, IF YOU DOWNLOAD A VIDEO AND EXPORT IT YOUR PHONE, SOMETIMES IT GETS EXPORTED AND SOMETIMES NOT. IF LUCKILY IT GOT EXPORTED, IT BEGINS TO MULTIPLY AS I SAID IN POINT 5)
      
      
      6, THE BATTERY. WITH THE INTERNET AND ALL THE BACKGROUND TASKS OFF, AND WITH NO LIVE TILES ON THE HOME SCREEN, THE MAXIMUM TIME I GOT WITH THE BATTERY IS 11 HOURS. IF I TURN ALL FEATURES ON, IT DRAINS IN 5-7 HOURS.
      
      
      7. YOU CANNOT OPEN THE PDF OR .TXT FILES PRESENT IN YOUR SD CARD. ONLY THOSE PDF FILES YOU DOWNLOAD VIA INTERNET CAN BE OPENED. AGAIN YOU CANNOT PDFS YOU DOWNLOAD IN YOUR SD CARD.
      
      
      8. APPLICATIONS CAN BE SAVED TO PHONE ONLY, NOT IN SD CARD.
      
      
      9. I STILL DONT KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MY INTERNAL MEMORY AND WHAT IS OCCUPYING IT. ANYWAY ITS FULL NOW. AND ONLY THING I COULD DO IS TO UNINSTALL THE PRESENT APPLICATIONS.
      
      
      10. THESE COMMENTS ARE FROM MY EXPERIENCE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH. TODAY I DONT HAVE THIS PHONE TO EXPERIENCE NOT BACAUSE I SOLD IT, BUT BECAUSE ITS DEAD NOW. FOR ANY OTHER PHONE YOU CAN TRY REMOVING THE BATTERY, RE-INSERTING IT AND RESTARTING. BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THIS INTERNAL BATTERY?????
      
      
      AGAIN I WANT TO TELL YOU AN AWKWARD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE. I AM A TECHIE AND HAS A HABIT OF LISTENING TO MUSIC WHILE CODING. ONE DAY IN OFFICE, I CONNECTED THE NOKIA HEADSET AND STARTED THE MUSIC. BUT MUSIC WAS PLAYING VIA LOUDSPEAKER ONLY. IT WAS NOT RECOGNIZING THE HEADSET AT ALL. I TRIED TO STOP THE MUSIC. BUT NONE OF THE KEYS WORKED, NOT THE PAUSE BUTTON, NOT THE VOLUME KEYS, NOT THE BACK BUTTON. I TRIED TO SWITCH THE PHONE OFF. BUT IT DIDNT WORK EITHER. I HAD TO COVER THE LOUDSPEAKER WITH MY FINGERTIP FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES HELPLESS AND SUDDENLY THE PHONE SWITCHED OFF. WITH RELIEF I REMOVED MY FINGERTIPS AND I COULDNT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED . MUSIC WAS STILL BEING PLAYED FROM THE SWITCHED OFF PHONE. AGAIN FOR THE NEXT 2-3 MINUTES I HAD TO COVER THE LOUDSPEAKER BEFORE THE MUSIC STOPPED. I SWITCHED IT ON AGAIN ONLY AFTER REACHING HOME. IF I HAD SOLD THE PHONE THAT DAY ITSELF. I WOULDNO HAVE TO KEEP A DEAD PHONE NOW IN MY HANDS.
      
      
      PS: I GIVE THIS PHONE ""A SINGLE STAR"" ONLY BACUSE I DONT HAVE ANY LOWER OPTION TO SELECT."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY 2 MONTH OLD NOKIA LUMIA 720. THE SECOND DAY ITSELF IT STARTED GIVING ME TROUBLE I.E- UNABLE TO SWITCH ON THE PHONE NOKIA 720,I COMPLAINED TO NOKIA, I DID AS THEY SUGGESTED BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUES. IN NIGHT I SWITCH OFF THE MOBILE AND  WHILE SWITCHING ON IT GOT STUCK DISPLAYING NOKIA LOGO ON THE SCREEN AND NONE OF THE DEDICATED KEY ARE WORKING.

Nokia Lumia 720,1,I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY BROTHER AND HE COULD USE IT FOR ONLY A DAY AND FROM THE NEXT DAY WE COULD NOT USE IT AS ITS NOT BOOTING. THE FIRST THOUGHT CAME TO MY MIND HOW GENUINE ARE THE PRODUCTS. I AM A FREQUENT BUYER OF THIS SITE AND REALLY DISAPPOINTED.
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"I HAVE FACED 8 DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IN 15 DAYS OF USE.

LUMIA 720 CAMERA BUTTON AND APP BOTH WERE NOT WORKING. AGAIN I APPROACHED NOKIA CARE AND IT TOOK 2 DAYS TO REPAIR IT. NOW AFTER A WEEK AGAIN SET GOT SWITCHED OFF AND NOT AT ALL GETTING SWITCH ON. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST SET I HAVE PURCHASED.

Nokia Lumia 720,1,"I'M USING WINDOWS PHONE SINCE 2012. SAMSUNG OMNIA WAS SUPERB BUT UNFORUTUNATELY I MIGRATED TO LUMIA 720 IN APRIL 2013. BELIEVE ME IT IS USELESS PHONE.

Nokia Lumia 720,1,"REALLY WINDOWS NEED TO GROW UP.HAVE TO WAIT FEW MORE YEARS.DON'T WORTH BUYING WINDOWS PHONE NOW.YOU WONT GET ALL THAT SMART PHONE FEEL.ANDROID HAS LAG AND OTHER ISSUES BUT IS FLEXIBLE AND VERSATILE WITH LOT OF CUSTOMIZATION AND APPS.WHEREAS WINDOWS HAS LIMITATIONS ON FEATURES THAT IS EVEN EASIER AND USER FRIENDLY ON BASIC PHONES. WINDOWS UI IS BORING EVERYTHING LIKE TILES LOOK THE SAME, THOUGH THE OS IS MORE STABLE."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"THE PRODUCT AS SUCH IS GOOD. BUT THERE MAY BE FEW DEFECTIVE PIECES OUT THERE THAT WSRETAIL IS SOMEHOW TRYING TO GET RID OFF. I HAVE PLACED AN ORDER FOR THIS MOBILE BUT RETURNED IT AS THE PIECE WAS DEFECTIVE. SINCE THE OVER ALL SERVICE WAS GOOD, I PLACED ANOTHER ORDER. NOW, I GET BACK THE SAME PIECE I HAVE RETURNED. I CAN SEE ALL THE OLD MESSAGES CONTACTS LYING AROUND. (I COULDNT DELETE THEM AS THE SCREEN WASNT SHOWING UP. IT WAS COMPLETE DARK. THAT WAS WHY I HAD TO RETURN THE PIECE). NOW I SEE THE SAME OLD PROBLEMS AGAIN. MOBILE HEATING UP ETC ETC. I HAVENT EXPECTED THESE KINDS OF PRODUCTS BEING DELIVERED BY FLIPKART. MIGHT BE THE FIRST PRODUCT I GOT IS AS WELL RETURNED BY SOME OTHER CUSTOMER. PLEASE DO NOT SEND THE SAME DEFECTIVE PIECE OVER AND OVER. PEOPLE JUST THINK NOKIA PRODUCTS ARE POOR WHEN THERE ARE ONLY FEW DEFECTIVE PIECES LYING OUT THERE."
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"THE REPLACEMENT POLICY SUCKS! THE SECOND DAY I BOUGHT MY PHONE,THE LOUDSPEAKER DINT WORK. WHEN SPOKE WITH FLIPCART, THEY SAY THE SELLER IS TO BLAME. I WAS FORCED TO TAKE THE PHONE TO A NOKIA SERVICE AND THERE IT GOES...AT LEAST 7 OR 8 PEOPLE THERE WITH 720 BOUGHT FROM FLIPCART THERE FOR SERVICE. THE BEAUTY IS ALL OF THEM HAD A BRAND NEW PHONE..WHICH WAS LESS THAN A WEEK OLD! CAREFUL!
      
      AT REAL IMPORTANT TIMES FLIPCART MAY OPEN THEIR HANDS!"
Nokia Lumia 720,1,THEY HAVE PRODUCED MANY DIFFECTIVE PIECES AND THEY ARE STILL SELLING THEM. THOUGH FEW ARE ENJOYING THE REMAINIG GOOD PIECES. BUT THE WHOLE BUISINESS IS EXTREAMLY PATHETIC FOR THE BUYERS WHO HAVE PURCHASED THE FAULTY PIECES WITH SO MUCH MONEY. I AM LUCKY THAT I SAVED MYSELF FROM BUYING THIS NOKIA.
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"THIS DEVICE IS A CRAB GOT SO MANY COMPLAINTS FROM THIS IT KEEPS RESTARTING EVEN AFTER GETTING A SOFTWARE UPDATE FROM THE NOKIA HANGED UP ONCE THE SCREEN TURNED TO ONE COLOUR AND AS THE BATTERY IS NOT REMOVABLE HAD TO TAKE IT TO THE SERVICE CENTER AGAIN
      
      ITS SCREEN EXPANDS ON ITS OWN AND D DEVICE HAS TO BE SWITCHED OFF ELSE U CNT DO ANYTHING
      
      ANOTHEW FLAW IS THAT D MSGES U HAVE EVEN REPLIED ON WHATSAPP KEEP POPING UP THAT IS REALLY IRRITATING"
Nokia Lumia 720,1,"WINDOWS (IN COMPUTERS) IS POPULAR BECAUSE OF ITS SIMPLICITY. BUT THIS NOKIA-WINDOWS COMBINATION IS VERY UNFRIENDLY. I AM POST-GRADUATE + TECH PROFESSIONAL, FOND OF TECH PRODUCTS. EVEN FOR ME IT IS VERY IRRITATING TO USE. MOREOVER, ""BEWARE!"" IT HAS GOT MICRO SIM CARD! I AM USING IT AS A NORMAL RS 1000 CATAGORY PHONE. BP+HOSPITAL VISIT IS ASSURED IF YOU BUY THIS PHONE. GOT IRRRRRRRRITATED WITH ITS STUPID SOFTWARE AND NOW PURCHASED SAMSUNG-ANDROID COMBINATION-A GREAT DECISION!"
Nokia Lumia 720,1,WINDOWS STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE. LIMITED HARDWARE. MISSES BASIC FEATURES FOUND IN OTHER PHONES.
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"@SIDDHARTH THAPA:
      
      1)WEIGHT IS AN ISSUE AGREED BUT ONCE U GIVE 2 HOURS ON THE DEVICE , ITS NORMAL , FOR GOD'S SAKE ITS JUST AN EXTRA 50 GRAM MAX ! WE HUMANS CAN DEFINITELY BEAR THAT MUCH EXTRA WEIGHT AS AN OFFSET FOR THIS BEAUTY.
      
      "
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"1)  MYTH:
      
      
      QUAD CORE IN SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS BETTER THAN DAUL CORE IN LUMIA 920
      
      
      FACT:
      
      
      NUMBER OF CORES IS JUST A MARKETING TERM. PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE DOES NOT DEPEND ON NUMBER OF CORES BUT ARCHITECTURE THAT THE PROCESSOR IT IS BUILT ON(THIS IS JUST A SINGLE EXAMPLE).THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED.
      
      
      FOR PEOPLE THOSE WHO WANT PROOFS CHECK THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3'S BENCHMARKS IN GSMARENA'S REVIEW.(WANTED TO ADD A LINK HERE BUT FLIPKART SAYS I CANT ADD A LINK HERE)
      
      
      HTC ONE S WHICH HAS THE EXACT SAME PROCESSOR AS LUMIA 920 BEATS S3 IN MANY BENCHMARK MARK TESTS AND EQUALS OR LOOSES NARROWLY IN FEW OF THEM. SO BOTH THESE PROCESSORS OR MORE OR LESS EQUALLY POWERFUL AND I WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE AN EDGE TO QUALCOMM DUAL KRAIT CORES THAT ARE PRESENT IN NOKIA LUMIA 920. ( SORRY MR. SIDDHARTH THAPA FOR POINTING YOU OUT HERE BUT IT IS YOU WHO NEEDS A REALITY CHECK AND BY THE WAY YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION FOR ME TO MOVE MY LAZY ASS AND WRITE THIS REVIEW HERE)
      
      
      2.) MYTH:
      
      
      WINDOWS PHONE 8 DOES NOT SUPPORT BLUETOOTH FILE TRANSFERS AND IT NEEDS ZUNE TO TRANSFER SONGS OR VIDEOS OR PICTURES.
      
      
      FACT:
      
      
      WINDOWS PHONE 7 HAS THESE LIMITATIONS BUT NOT WINDOWS PHONE 8.  WINDOWS PHONE  8 SUPPORTS BOTH BLUETOOTH FILE TRANSFER AND USB MASS STORAGE. WE CAN TRANSFER SONGS, VIDEOS AND PHOTOS JUST BY CONNECTING OUR PHONE WITH LAPTOP. A DRIVE AUTOMATICALLY APPEARS LIKE HOW IT APPEARS WHEN WE CONNECT A PENDRIVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE CONNECT THE PHONE.
      
      (AGAIN MR. SIDDHARTH THAPA YOU NEED TO GET YOUR FACTS CORRECTED.)
      
      
      3). MYTH:
      
      WE CANNOT SELECT CUSTOM RINGTONES (SELECT A SONG WE LIKE AS A RINGTONE).
      
      
      FACT:
      
      
      WE CAN SELECT CUSTOM RINGTONES BUT THERE IS A CATCH. ITS NOT THAT DIRECT AS IN ANDROID BUT IT IS MADE EASIER WHEN COMPARED TO WINDOWS PHONE 7. CONNECT YOU PHONE TO LAPTOP. OPEN THE WINDOWS PHONE DRIVE IN MY COMPUTER. THEN OPEN THE RINGTONES FOLDER AND SAVE THE SONG YOU LIKE INTO THAT FOLDER. REMAINING PROCESS IS SAME AS SELECTING A RINGTONE.
      
      
      NOW I  BIELIEVE I HAVE CLEARED ALL THE MAJOR MYTHS REGARDING THIS PHONE OR OS.
      
      
      AFTER USING THIS PHONE FOR A MONTH THESE ARE MY IMPRESSIONS ABOUT THIS PHONE
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING CAMERA WHICH TAKES AMAZING STILLS IN LOW LIGHT. AND LENS APPS LIKE SMARTSHOOT, PANAROMA AND CINIMAGRAPH ARE A TREAT TO USE. OF ALL THE THREE ,SMARTSHOOT IS GREATLY USEFUL WHILE TAKING GROUP SHOTS.
      
      2. GORGEOUS SCREEN.
      
      3. STUNNING TOUCH RESPONSE. (BOTH THESE QUALITIES MAKES ME TAKE MY PHONE EVERY 15                 MINUTES OUT OF MY POCKET AND PLAY WITH IT.)
      
      4. I SWITCHED FROM IPHONE 4 TO LUMIA 920 AND I AM JUST LOVING IT. WINDOWS PHONE 8 IS A LOVELY OS. I JUST CANT TAKE MY EYES OF MY PHONE. THOSE LIVE TILES ARE SO COLOURFULL AND INFORMATIVE. I HAVE ALSO USED ANDROID PHONE LIKE GALAXY S2 AND HTC ONE S PREVIOUSLY. THOUGH ANDROID HAS FAR MORE ABILITIES AS AN OS , I STILL LOVE WINDOWS PHONE 8 FOR ITS SIMPLICITY AND SOCIAL INTEGRATION AND ITS COMPLEETLY LAG FREE.
      
      5. MICROSOFT MOBILE OFFICE PREINSTALLED WITH CAPABILITIES TO EDIT WORD AND EXCEL DOCUMENTS AND OPEN POWERPOINT DOCUMENTS.
      
      
      BATTERY LIFE:
      
      
      WELL I WOULD CLASSIFY MYSELF AS A HEAVY USER LIKE
      
      CALLS - 1 HOUR.
      
      NET ON ALL THE TIME
      
      MESSAGING ON WHATSAPP MOST OF THE TIME.
      
      BROWSING - 1 HOUR.
      
      SONGS- 1 HOUR.
      
      AS  I SAID PREVIOUSLY I WOULD TAKE MY PHONE OUT EVERY 15 MINUTES AND PLAY WITH.
      
      SO AFTER ALL THIS USAGE I USUALLY GET 15 TO 18 HOURS OF USAGE AFTER ONE FULL CHARGE.
      
      
      APPS:
      
      
      I FOUND 99% PERCENT OF THE APPS I WANTED AND THEY ARE SURPRISINGLY GOOD. I AM NOT AN AVID GAMER. I USUALLY PLAY RANDOM GAMES JUST TO KILL TIME. PEOPLE WHO WANT GAMES THAT ARE ON ANDROID OR IOS WILL BE DISSAPOINTED. EXCEPT THIS I BELIEVE MOST OF THE IMPORTANT APPS WILL COME TO THE PLATFORM SOONER OR LATER.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      WELL I DID NOT FIND ANY CONS
      
      OVERALL THIS IS BEST SMARTPHONE I HAVE EVER USED."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"1. NO 3G VIDEO CALLING -&GT; WHAT IS SKYPE FOR? THERE ISN'T ANY ALTERNATIVE FOR WINDOWS PHONE'S SKYPE INTEGRATION. THEN THERE ARE LOADS OF OTHER VIDEO CALL APPS TOO.
      
      
      2. NO FILE BROWSER. (MICROSOFT'S SMART ANSWER IS : IT'S A CLOSED SOURCE ) THIS ANSWER DOESN'T FULFILL THE USER'S REQUIREMENT -&GT; MICROSOFT NEVER GAVE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. WINDOWS DESKTOP HAS FILE BROWSER, SO IS IT OPEN SOURCE? PLEASE UNDERSTAND WHAT OPEN SOURCE IS, IT IS THE ABILITY TO MODIFY SOURCE CODE AND IS COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO FILE BROWSER.
      
      
      WHY IS FILE BROWSER NOT PRESENT IN WP? BECAUSE WP DOES NOT IMPOSE STONE AGE FEATURES ON IT'S USER. WHY BOTHER TO CREATE FOLDERS? WHY MOVE THINGS? WHY DO EVERYTHING MANUALLY WHEN YOUR PHONE DOES IT FOR YOU? THE FIRST SIGN OF A MODERN SMARTPHONE OS IS THE ABSENCE OF FILE MANAGER. THAT IS WHY YOU WON'T FIND ONE ON IOS. ONLY SOME INSECURE, BUGGY OS HAS FILE MANAGER.
      
      
      3. NO LOW BATTERY INDICATION - IT JUST SAY GOOD BYE AND SHUTS DOWN -&GT; COMPLETELY FALSE. IT SHOWS A POPUP SAYING BATTERY IS LOW AND BATTERY SAVER MODE IS TURNED ON. THIS FEATURE IS PRESENT IN EVERY WINDOWS PHONE.
      
      
      4. NO SUPPORT FOR HID BLUETOOTH PROFILE -&GT; SERIOUSLY I DO NOT SEE ANY NEED OF THIS IN TODAY'S WORLD. EVERYBODY IS GOING COMPACT INSTEAD OF USING PHYSICAL KEYBOARDS OR MICE.
      
      
      5.CAN YOU SEEK FORWARD OR BACKWARD IN WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER WHILE PLAYING MP3, CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT IF YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE SONG -&GT; TIGHT PRESS ON LEFT ARROWS TO SEEK BACK AND RIGHT ARROWS TO SEEK FORWARD.
      
      
      AS I HAVE GIVEN MY ANSWERS KINDLY USE THE PHONE, OR YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS IN FORUMS. BUT THINGS LIKE SEEK AND BATTERY NOTIFICATION SHOULD BE KNOWN TO ALL, WONDER THEY WERE NOT ANSWERED!
      
      
      BY THE WAY THE PHONE PERFORMS SMOOTHLY AND DOES NOT NEED QUAD CORE PROCESSOR UNLIKE HTC ONE X :)"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"A REALY MONEY WORTHY PHONE, BUT THE REAL MINUS POINT IS IT DON'T HAVE A NATIVE VIDEO CALL OPTION. YOU CAN DO IT IN THE SKYPE. FOR THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE SKYPE CREDIT, OR THE OTHER PERSON SHOULD HAVE A SKYPE ACCOUNT, HE SHOULD BE IN ONLINE."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"A SUPERB FONE , THE FEEL OF HOLDING THIS GADGET IS AWESOME , VERY STURDY AND TOUGH.  VERY GOOD HARD WARE. WINDOWS 8 ALSO WILL NEVER MAKE YOU DISAPPOINTED , FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE TRAVELLING AND ROAD TRIPS TRUST ME THIS HAS THE BEST NAVIGATION SYSTEM.
      
      
      YOU MIGHT NEED A SCREEN GUARD AS EVEN WITH GORILLA GLASS IT IS VULNERABLE FOR MINUTE SCRATCHES. BUT NOT REALLY NEEDED. WORTH FOR MONEY"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"ACCESSORIES ALWAYS EARN YOU GLANCES OF ADMIRATION AND ENVY. BUT WHO KNEW, EVEN YOUR ELECTRONIC GADGETS COULD DO THE SAME? I GOT MYSELF THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 RECENTLY. IT HAS TURNED ON ITS CHARM IN SUCH A WAY THAT I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS PEOPLE STOP BY TO ASK ME ABOUT IT OR STEAL GLANCES AT IT. IT JUST FEELS GREAT AND TALKS VOLUMES OF THE STYLE THIS PHONE POSSESSES. ITS UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN EXUDES PERFECTION AND CLASS.
      
      THE 8.7 MP CAMERA OF MY LUMIA 920 MEANS I AM ALWAYS ENTRUSTED WITH CLICKING SNAPS AT BIRTHDAY PARTIES, SOCIAL EVENTS AND PRIVATE DOES. THE PHOTO QUALITY IS BETTER THAN PROFESSIONAL WITH THE CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS, PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION. I HAVE BEEN COMMENDED MANY A TIMES ABOUT THE BLUR-FREE AND NON-SHAKY QUALITY OF MY VIDEOS EVEN SHOT DURING THE NIGHT WITH THE HELP OF THE DUAL LED FLASH. PREVIEWING IMAGES, WATCHING MOVIES AND PLAYING GAMES IS ALMOST LIKE ON A BIG-SCREEN TV WITH THE HIGH-RESOLUTION 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY. DUE TO THE INTEGRATED PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY, EVERY VISUAL IS RENDERED SPECTACULARLY. I CAN?T MAINTAIN A COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF TIMES I HAVE WATCHED ENTIRE SEASONS OF MY FAVOURITE TV SERIES WHILE ON THE MOVE. THE CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION ON THE SCREEN INCREASES ITS RESISTANCE TO THE ROUGH USE I SOMETIMES SUBJECT IT TO.
      
      THERE WAS NOTHING, NOT WORTH LIKING IN THE WINDOWS 8 OS ON MY LUMIA 920. IT IS JUST SO EASY TO USE AND CONVENIENT; LOOKS GREAT TOO. THE COLOURFUL LIVE TILES ARE A PLEASANT BREAK FROM THE WIDGETS HANGING AROUND ON LANDSCAPED WALLPAPERS ON MY OLD HTC SMARTPHONE. I HAVE PUT UP ALL MY FAVOURITE APPS ON THE HOME SCREEN WHERE I CAN REACH THEM EASILY. SAME IS THE CASE WITH ALL MY FAVOURITE CONTACTS WHO HAVE BEEN TAGGED TO MY HOME SCREEN USING PEOPLE HUB. THIS FEATURE CONVENIENTLY NOTIFIES ME OF ANY UPDATES THAT THEY POST TO THEIR SOCIAL NETWORKING PROFILES. EDITING AND VIEWING MS OFFICE DOCUMENTS ARE A BREEZE ON MY NOKIA SMARTPHONE, AS IS THE CASE WITH MANAGING MY EMAILS VIA THE INTEGRATED OUTLOOK APP. INSIDE MY LUMIA 920, NOKIA HAS HARNESSED THE POWER OF DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR ALONG WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. THIS HELPS ME ZIP THROUGH MULTIPLE TASKS AT THE SAME TIME AND ALSO PLAY HD GAMES THAT I COULD NOT EVEN DREAM OF ON MY OLD PHONE. STORING MY MASSIVE MUSIC COLLECTION AND SET OF FAVOURITE MUSIC VIDEOS IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM DUE TO THE BUILT-IN 32 GB STORAGE SPACE. I CAN NOW TRAVEL TO FAR-OFF DESTINATIONS WITH CONFIDENCE THAT I WILL NEVER GET LOST, DUE TO THE NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE APPS. THESE APPS OFFER TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS WITHOUT ANY NEED FOR DATA USAGE. I HAVE LOVED THE NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION OR NFC TECHNOLOGY RIGHT SINCE ITS INCEPTION, AND MY LUMIA 920 USES IT WITH LAN!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"AFTER MY BREAK-UP WITH MY GIRLFRIEND OF FIVE YEARS, I WAS VERY DEPRESSED AND LONELY. MY SISTER, ALSO MY BEST FRIEND, WAS VERY CONCERNED AND WANTED ME TO REALLY CHEER UP. SHE DID A WONDERFUL THING FOR ME AND GIFTED ME THE LATEST NOKIA LUMIA 920. THE NOTE ON THE GIFT READ, ?CHARGES WIRELESSLY JUST LIKE YOU SHOULD? AND ?CHEER, UP KEEP GOING JUST LIKE THE BATTERY.? I HUGGED HER AND FROM THAT DAY, THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 HAS BECOME MY MATE! THE BRIGHT COLOURS CAN CHEER UP THE DULLEST DAYS AND THE RICH FEATURES OF THIS PHONE MAKE SURE I NEVER HAVE A BORING MOMENT. I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO FEEL LONELY, WITH THE AMAZING WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM. I CAN EASILY EDIT MS OFFICE FILES WHILE ON THE GO OR VIEW PDF DOCUMENTS. THE LIVE TILES AND PEOPLEHUB FEATURES HELP ME STAY SOCIAL AND CONNECTED TO MY FRIENDS. THANKS TO CONSTANT FACEBOOK UPDATES RIGHT ON MY HOMESCREEN, I HAVE STARTED CHATTING WITH OLD BUDDIES MORE AND THIS REALLY HELPS ME OPEN UP.
      
      
      MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 HAS THE BEST CAMERA I HAVE EVER SEEN. I GO OUT FOR LONG WALKS AND CLICK AMAZING PICTURES WITH THE PHONE?S 8.7 MP CAMERA. INTEGRATED WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS AND REVOLUTIONARY PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY, THE CAMERA CHURNS OUT PROFESSIONAL LOOKING SNAPS. THE OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION TAKES CARE OF THE BLUR. EVEN WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE IS CLOUDY OR DARK, THE CAMERA CAN CLICK CLEAR PICTURES, THANKS TO ITS DUAL LED FLASH THAT IS QUITE POWERFUL.
      
      
      PLAYING GAMES, WATCHING VIDEOS OR SURFING THE NET, I?M BUSY ALL THE TIME. THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 CAN NEVER GIVE UP ON ME WITH ITS DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR THAT COMBINES WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. PLAYING GAMES IS TRULY A REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCE! ALL THIS ON THE SUPER-SENSITIVE 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY AND MUCH MORE! THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 IS WELL-INTEGRATED WITH THE PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY FOR AN ENRICHED VIEWING EXPERIENCE AND THE CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 FOR SCREEN PROTECTION. I DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SMUDGES AND SCRATCHES ON MY SCREEN ANYMORE, PLUS MY FINGERS AREN?T TIRED TYPING. JUST A SOFT TOUCH AND THE COMMAND IS ACCEPTED!
      
      
      WHEN IN A GROUP, I DON?T FEEL LEFT OUT ANYMORE BECAUSE EVERYONE WANTS THE LATEST SONGS THAT I DOWNLOAD WITH NOKIA MUSIC AND COMPILE MY OWN PLAYLISTS WITH THE NOKIA MIX RADIO. TRANSFERRING THEM TO MANY FRIENDS AT THE SAME TIME IS EASY TOO WITH THE NFC, WI-FI, WLAN AND BLUETOOTH FEATURES ON MY LUMIA 920. SURFING THE INTERNET IS DOUBLE FUN AND I DON?T HAVE TO WASTE TIME UNTIL VIDEOS BUFFER WITH THE PHONE?S SUPPORT FOR 3G AND LTE SERVICES. NOT THAT ANY PHONE IS A REPLACEMENT FOR A HUMAN, BUT THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN MY WORK-LIFE, SOCIAL-LIFE AND PERSONAL LIFE. THE BATTERY GOES ON FOR REALLY LONG AND CAN BE CHARGED WIRELESSLY."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"AT A TIME WHEN NOKIA HAS TAKEN A HEAVY BEATING IN THE MARKET PLACE, IT IS AWE INSPIRING TO SEE HOW THEY HAVE BOUNCED BACK AGAINST HEAVYWEIGHT CONTENDERS LIKE SAMSUNG AND APPLE WITH THIS MAGNIFICIENT NEW PHONE. PHONE IS A LITTLE CHUNKY, BUT AT LEAST GIVES YOU THE HEARTWARMING FEELING OF DURABILITY AND COMFORT.
      
      IT HAS ONE OF THE BEST SOFTWARE PLATFORMS IN THE MARKET TODAY AND IM SURE NEWER APPS ARE COMING UP.
      
      HATS OFF ONCE AGAIN TO FLIPKART FOR THEIR IMPECCABLE SERVICE. THE PACKAGING WAS AWESOME AND IT REACHED ME WITHOUT A SCRATCH."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"FINALLY AFTER A HUGE LONG WAITING, TODAY I SAW THAT NOKIA LUMIA 920 RED COLOUR IS AVAILABLE IN FLIP-KART.COM, ASA I SAW, BOOKED IT, AND W8 FOR MY UPCOMING NEW REVIEW ABT THE PHONE FULL DETAILS INCLUDING THE LOOK OF NOKIA LUMIA 920 RED COLOUR
      
      
      THE MOST INNOVATIVE SMARTPHONE EVER BUILDED STILL NOW IN THIS PLANET"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"FIRSTLY I WANTED TO SAY EVERY PHONE HAS ITS PROS AND CONS. BUT HOW FAR A PHONE MAKE YOUR DAY, IS THE ONE WHICH MATTERS MOST. I WAS A HARDCORE ANDROID PHONE ONCE, DOING ALL SHORT OF CUSTOM ROM STUFF. BUT THEN I REALIZED DOES ALL THESE JAZZY THINGS REALLY MATTERS. NO, ALL YOU NEED IS SIMPLICITY. THAT'S WHAT WINDOWS PHONES ARE ALL ABOUT. I BOUGHT NOKIA LUMIA 920 FROM FLIPKART. FIRSTLY I THANK THEM FOR SHIPPING ME YELLOW LUMIA 920 IN 2 DAYS WHEN NO ONE WAS READY TO SHIP ME WITHIN A WEEK.
      
      WHEN I FIRST STARTED USING THE PHONE I WAS HAVING A TOUGH TIME FOR A WEEK IN FINDING APPS AND GETTING USED TO THE PHONE. BUT THATS A SMALL TIME, FOR A NEW PLATFORM. LATER I REALIZED AMAZING ALTERNATIVES FOR WINDOWS PHONE IN TERMS OF APP.
      
      NEXT IS BUILD QUALITY: THE BEST BUILD QUALITY I HAVE EVER SEEN IN A PHONE. ROCK SOLID. I AM NOT AT ALL USING ANY CASE OR COVER FOR THE PHONE. I HAVE DROPPED THE PHONE LIKE 5-6 TIME, BUT NOT EVEN A SINGLE SCRATCH SO FAR.
      
      CAMERA: AMAZING LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY. DISCLAIMER: WHEN YOU GET THIS LUMIA, YOU INVOLVE YOURSELF IN TAKING LOT OF PHOTOS. THAT IS GUARANTEED.
      
      APPS: ALTERNATIVES FOR ALMOST ALL THE APPS AVAILABLE IN THE STORE. DEALS AVAILABLE DAILY BASIS.
      
      
      FINAL WORD: ONE HAPPY WP8 USER, WHO WAS A HARDCORE ANDROIDER"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"GIRLS TEND TO GET IMPRESSED WITH GUYS WHO ARE INFORMATIVE, STAYS ABREAST WITH THE LATEST NEWS AND INFORMATION. I HAVE NEVER BEEN THAT KIND OF A GUY, BUT I NEVER LIKED TO LEAVE A CHANCE TO IMPRESS A GIRL I MEET. AND MY NEW PHONE, THE NOKIA LUMIA 920, IS MY PARTNER IN CRIME WHEN IT COMES TO FULFILLING THAT ASPIRATION. WITH ITS HERE CITY LENS, HERE MAPS, HERE DRIVE AND HERE TRANSIT FUNCTION, I CAN EASILY GET ALL THE NEARBY INFORMATION OF THE CITY BE IT EATERIES, DISCOS, MOVIE THEATRES AND SOCIAL CLUBS. I LOVE TO SEE THAT SUPER-AWED LOOK ON HER FACE THAT FOLLOWS!
      
      
      ANOTHER WAY TO IMPRESS GIRLS IS TO CLICK SUPER-HOT SNAPS AND POST THEM ON FB. MY PHONE?S 8.7 MP CAMERA, FEATURING A CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS WITH PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION, HELPS ME LOOK MORE HANDSOME IN PICTURES THAN IN REAL LIFE AND MAKES ME GO YAHOO! THE DUAL LED FLASH MAKES ANY NIGHT LIGHT UP LIKE DAY AND IMPARTS AN UNDENIABLE VIBRANCY TO MY PICS. THE PUREMOTION HD+ 4.5-INCH TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY IS THE BRIGHTEST AND FASTEST I?VE EVER SEEN. JUST A FEATHERY TOUCH OF THE DISPLAY AND IT RESPONDS IN AN INSTANT. COVERED WITH CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2, THIS DISPLAY CAN TAKE ANY KIND OF ROUGH USE AND STILL LOOK GOOD AS NEW. THE UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN IS NOT ONLY CHIC, BUT ALSO MAKES MY LUMIA 920 EXTREMELY DURABLE.
      
      
      ITS WIRELESS CHARGING PAD MAKES CHARGING A CINCH. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS PLACE MY PHONE ON THE PAD AND IT SOAKS UP POWER LIKE A SPONGE SOAKING UP ON SOAPY WATER.  I MUST SAY I?M QUITE IMPRESSED WITH THE DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR AND 1 GB RAM, WHICH MAKES MY APP EXECUTION AND GAME PLAY SUPER SPEEDY. ITS 32 GB ONBOARD STORAGE LETS ME STORE ALL MY MUSIC TRACKS, FAVOURITE MOVIES, MY PHOTOGRAPHS AS WELL AS ANY OTHER DIGITAL CONTENT. THE SKYDRIVE?S FREE CLOUD STORAGE OF 7 GB IS GREAT TO STORE ALL MY DATA.
      
      
      THE BUILT-IN WINDOWS 8 OS FEATURES VARIOUS BUSINESS APPS LIKE ADOBE ACROBAT READER, WORD, EXCEL AND POWERPOINT AND GIVES ME THE COMFORTABLE FEELING OF WORKING ON A COMPUTER. THE ME TILES GIVES ME QUICK ACCESS TO ALL THE FREQUENTLY BROWSED APPS, FOR INSTANCE FACEBOOK, YAHOO MAIL, AND GMAIL. ITS MULTITUDE OF CONNECTIVITY FEATURES LIKE 3G, LTE, NFC, WLAN, WI-FI AND BLUETOOTH ADD TO THE COMFORT. MY PHONE PROVIDES 10.8 HOURS OF 3G TALK TIME AND UP TO 460 HOURS OF 3G BATTERY STANDBY TIME WHICH LETS ME TALK OR LISTEN, DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT?S MY FRIENDS OR MY GIRL I AM ON CALL WITH, AS MUCH AS I WANT TO.  MY PHONE?S NOKIA MUSIC MAKES SURE I NEVER STOP LISTENING TO MUSIC. IT?S THE BEST SMARTPHONE I?VE EVER SEEN IN THE MARKET."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"GOOD LOOKING PHONE, SMOOTH FLOWING OS N HARDWARE TO BACK IT UP. NOKIA WILL DEFINITELY MAKE SOME LOST GROUND WITH THIS PHONE. HIGHLIGHTS ARE CAMERA, SPEAKERS, BRIGHT DISPLAY AND APPS INTEGRATION. IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO GET USE TO INTERFACE IF U R ANDROID R IOS USER BUT ONCE U GET HANG OF WINDOWS 8 ITS GREAT.

Nokia Lumia 920,5,GOOD PHONE BUT BADLY OVER PRICED. IF GALAXY S3 IS BETTER FOR MUCH LESS PRICE. REDUCE THE F-ING PRICE. NOKIA IS STRUGGLING IN THE SMART PHONE MARKET AND LAUNCHING OVER PRICED PHONES??? WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"GOT MY LUMIA 920 LAST WEEK AND ITS EVERYTHING I WISH MY PHONE TO BE. BEAUTIUL DESIGN AND A POWERFUL MACHINE. LOW LIGHT CAMERA CLICKS ARE JUST AMAZING. A QUALITY PRODUCT, ITS BULKY BUT GUESS WHAT THAT'S THE NEW TREND :-)
      
      
      PRETTY GOOD MARKETPLACE, WE HAVE EVERYTHING WHAT ANDROID PROVIDES IF NOT THE SAME APPS SOMETHING SIMILAR EX. INSTEAD OF INSTAGRAM WINDOWS HAVE 2INSTAWITHLOVE AND IT PRETTY MUCH SERVES THE PURPOSE.

      EXPLORER WORKING VERY FINE WITH WINDOW 8. AWESOME EXPERIENCE TO WORK WITH FACEBOOK."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"HAVE HAD THE PHONE FOR FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW AND ITS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO USE IT. SUMMARY -
      
      
      - PROS
      
      * GREAT, GREAT UI. IT'S INTUITIVE, ELEGANT AND REALLY SIMPLE.
      
      * THE CAMERA IS AS GOOD AS WE'VE HEARD ALL ALONG.
      
      * THE DISPLAY IS RICH AND COMPARABLE IF NOT BETTER THAN ANY DEVICE IN THE MARKET.
      
      * SOLID BUILD, I ACTUALLY PREFER THE SLIGHT HEFT. PLUS YOU CAN DROP THE PHONE A FEW    TIMES AND IT WONT MIND! :) DOESN'T NEED A COVER!
      
      * GREAT INTEGRATION WITH FB, AND AWESOME SET OF PRE-LOADED APPS. (NOKIA DRIVE+ ETC)
      
      * VERY EASY TO SETUP - TOOK ME ABOUT 15 MINUTES TO SYNC CONTACTS, MAIL, CALENDAR.
      
      
      - CONS
      
      * VIBRATION MAKES AN ANNOYING RATTLE (THIS IS NOT PARTICULAR TO MY DEVICE). A TRAGEDY FOR A PHONE THAT'S OTHERWISE SO WELL MADE. I HOPE A PATCH FIXES THIS SOON (SHOULD REDUCE THE POWER TO THE MOTOR).
      
      * WHILE ALL THE IMPORTANT APPS ARE THERE, THE GOOGLE VS MS WAR LEAVES A FEW IMPORTANT CASUALTIES (GMAIL APP). THIS IS MORE A LONG TERM CONCERN FOR WP8 OWNERS.
      
      * DATA SENSE IS MISSING FOR WP8 IN INDIA AS FAR AS I KNOW, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT AVAILABLE ON AIRTEL.
      
      
      OVERALL, A GREAT PHONE, AMONGST THE BEST YOU CAN OWN NOW AND DEFINITELY THE BEST DEVICE FOR WP8 WHICH IS AN AMAZING SOFTWARE YOU SHOULD EXPERIENCE! THE 920 + WP8 COMBINATION WILL MAKE APPLE AND ANDROID WORK HARDER!!
      
      
      FLIPKART SERVICE WAS GREAT ON TIME TAKEN TO DELIVER, ALTHOUGH THE PACKAGING WAS A TAD FLIMSY ESPECIALLY FOR A PREMIUM ELECTRONIC DEVICE - GONE ARE THE DAYS FLIPKART SENT BOOKS THAT WOULD SURVIVE A BULLET. ALSO WHY WOULD YOU LAUNCH AT 38,199 AND MOVE TO 37,199 IN 4-5 DAYS. A SILLY WAY TO HANDLE YOUR FIRST FEW CUSTOMERS?!!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"HAVING USED A VARIETY OF SMARTPHONES, I WAS A BIT SCEPTICAL WHEN I HEARD NOKIA HAD LAUNCHED ITS OWN SERIES OF LUMIA SMARTPHONES. THE BRAND HAS BEEN AN ICON OF RELIABILITY, BUT FOR SOME APPARENT REASON, HAD FALLEN BEHIND ITS COMPETITORS WHEN IT CAME TO SMARTPHONES. BUT, WHEN I COULD NOT RESIST THE ALLURE AND GOT MY HANDS ON THE NOKIA LUMIA 920, I WAS IN FOR A REAL SURPRISE. THIS SMARTPHONE IS SURELY ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE DEVICES TO BE EVER LAUNCHED BY NOKIA.
      
      
      THE UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN OF MY LUMIA 920 IS NOT LIKE ANYTHING I HAVE SEEN YET, AND IT COMES IN SUCH VIBRANTLY COLOURED COVERS. THE CAMERA ON MY NEW NOKIA SMARTPHONE IS A WHOPPING 8.7 MP REAR SHOOTER THAT COMES WITH A CUTTING-EDGE AND SOPHISTICATED CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS. INTEGRATING PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION, THIS CAMERA RENDERS ALL MY PHOTOGRAPHS IN PRISTINE QUALITY, ALMOST AS IF SHOT BY A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER. ALSO INCLUDED, IS A DUAL LED FLASH THAT LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT AND ALLOWS LOW-LIGHT IMAGING.
      
      
      THE SCREEN OF MY LUMIA 920 IS A 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCH DISPLAY THAT FEATURES PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. IT RESPONDS QUICKLY TO MY TOUCH AND CAN ALSO BE USED WHEN WEARING GLOVES. THE CURVED DESIGN OF THE DISPLAY PROVIDES ENHANCED READABILITY IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT. WITH CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION, THIS TOUGH DISPLAY EASILY WEATHERS MY ROUGH USE. THE WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM IN MY LUMIA 920 IS A BREAKTHROUGH IN TERMS OF CONVENIENCE AND NAVIGATION. IT COMES WITH FEATURES LIKE PEOPLEHUB THAT HELPS ME TAG ALL MY FREQUENTLY USED CONTACTS TO MY HOME SCREEN. ALL THEIR SOCIAL NETWORKING UPDATES REACH ME DIRECTLY, WITHOUT THE EFFORT OF LOGGING INTO THESE SITES AND BROWSING TO THEIR PROFILES. THE LIVE TILES INTERFACE LETS ME ARRANGE ALL MY FREQUENTLY USED APPS AND GAMES ON MY HOME SCREEN. MICROSOFT OFFICE COMES PRE-INSTALLED ON MY PHONE AND THE SUPPORT FOR MS WORD, EXCEL AND POWERPOINT MAKE WORK ON THE MOVE, REALLY SIMPLE AND ENJOYABLE. I ALSO USE THE INTEGRATED MS OUTLOOK APP FOR MANAGING MY EMAILS.
      
      
      MY LUMIA 920 OUTPERFORMS QUITE A FEW OF ITS CONTEMPORARIES DUE TO ITS DUAL CORE 1.5 GHZ GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR, AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. THIS MAKES MULTITASKING A BREEZE AND LETS ME PLAY HD GAMES AND EXECUTE MEMORY-INTENSIVE APPS. STORING DATA IS ALSO NOT A PROBLEM, AS I CAN USE THE 32 GB ONBOARD MEMORY. ADDITIONALLY, NOKIA ALSO PROVIDES COMPLIMENTARY SKYDRIVE STORAGE FOR ADDITIONAL DATA NEEDS.
      
      
      WHEN ON THE MOVE, I DO NOT LIKE TO ASK FOR DIRECTIONS TO MY DESTINATION. THIS IS WHERE THE NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE APPS OF MY LUMIA 920 COME IN HANDY. THEY PROVIDE ME WITH TURN BY TURN DIRECTIONS EVEN WHEN I AM NOT SUBSCRIBED TO DATA USAGE. ON THE CONNECTIVITY FRONT, MY LUMIA 920 COMES WITH WI-FI, WLAN, NFC AND BLUETOOTH WHICH MAKES EXCHANGING FILES AND ACCESSING THE WEB ALL THE MORE EASY."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"HI ALL,
      
      
      I SEARCHED FOR THIS LUMIA 920 RED AT MANY PLACES IN BANGALORE , EVERY WHERE IT IS OUT OF STOCK, ONLY BLACK COLOR IS AVAILABLE.
      
      
      SO I ORDERED IT IN FLIPKART, PRICE IS SOME WHAT LESS COMPARED TO OUTLETS IN BANGALORE.I ORDERED IT ON FEB 12TH(NYT 10 O CLK) , I GOT IT ONT FEB 15TH MORNING 11 AM. I FELT VERY HAPPY AND SERVICE IS VERY GOOD. THANKS FLIPKART.
      
      
      COMING TO MOBILE , ITS BETTER THAN ANY MOBILE WHICH IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN MARKET.
      
      AWESOME TOUCH , WINDOWS INTERFACE IS TOO GOOD.
      
      
      RED COLOR IS AMAZING COMPARED TO OTHER MODELS.
      
      
      THOSE WHO DONT WANT TO USE ANDROID CAN PICK THIS MOBILE , ITS THE BEST CHOICE .
      
      I AM USING IT FROM PAST 4 HOURS, ITS AMAZING AND SMOOTH .
      
      
      DONT THINK ABOUT ITS BULKY  BODY , WHICH GIVES KILLER LOOKS FOR THIS MOBILE AND ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT YOU WILL NEVER FEEL THAT .!!!
      
      
      LUMIA 920 RED ROCKS :)"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"HIII ALL,
      
      I HAVE BROUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART,BLACK ONE.
      
      THE PHONE IS AWESOME THOUGH IT NEEDS SOME TWEAKS HERE AND THERE.
      
      1.THE OS IS VERY SIMPLE...ACTUALLY SIMPLIFIED A LOT
      
      2.CAMERA AT NIGHT IS AWESOME.
      
      3.PEOPLE'S HUB IS GOOD.
      
      4.CITY LENS IS VERY GOOD.
      
      5.THE UNIBODY DESIGN IS GOOD.
      
      6.THE SCREEN IS REALLY ONE OF THE BEST.THE TOUCH EVEN IN LOW SENSITIVITY IS SNAPPY
      
      NOW I WILL TALK ABOUT THE SMALL BLUNDERS/AREAS WHERE MODIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED
      
      1.THE BRIGHTNESS EVEN IN LOW MODE IS QUITE BRIGHT(ONLY 3 MODES- HIGH,MEDIUM AND LOW).ITS A PROBLEM CONSIDERING BATTERY LIFE WHICH IS HARDLY A DAY IN 3G CONNECTION.
      
      2.SOME MENUS SUPPORT ONLY VERTICAL ORIENTATION,IT BECOMES AN ANNOYANCE WHILE YOU LIE DOWN ON A BED.
      
      3. NO LOCK FOR SCREEN ROTATION
      
      4.TO DISCONNECT FROM NET YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE SETTINGS EVERYTIME.IF THERE IS SIMPLE POP UP TYPE MENU IT WOULD BE AWESOME
      
      5.LACK OF  NOTIFICATION CENTER(WHICH MS PROMISED TO GIVE IN NEXT UPDATE)
      
      6.NO WAY TO TYPE IN CAPITAL LETTERS CONTINUOUSLY.
      
      BUT BELIEVE ME ITS AN AWESOME DEVICE.IT FEELS GOOD IN HAND.
      
      MAKE PEOPLE ENVY YOU BY BUYING THIS PHONE EVEN THOUGH THE PRICE IS LITTLE HIGH.
      
      BUT ITS WORTH IT ?"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I AM HERE TO EXPRESS MY COMPLETE SATISFACTION FOR THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 SMARTPHONE THAT I JUST BOUGHT FOR MYSELF. IN FACT, SATISFACTION WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THIS PHONE IS SUCH AS TREASURE HOUSE OF FEATURES, THAT IT TOOK DAYS FOR ME TO COMPLETELY EXPLORE ITS CAPABILITIES. AND SINCE THEN, I HAVE BEEN IN AWE! THE UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN IS SO SLEEK AND SUAVE. MY FAVOURITE AMONG THE LUMIA 920?S LONG LIST OF FEATURE IS THE 8.7 MP CAMERA THAT COMES WITH A CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS. MY FRIENDS ARE AMAZED AT THE CLARITY AND BLUR-FREE NATURE OF MY PHOTOS CLICKED EVEN WHEN IN MOTION. ALL THIS THANKS TO THE PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION. THE LARGE 4.7-INCH TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY OF MY LUMIA 920 INTEGRATES PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. EVERYTHING ON THIS PHONE JUST SEEMS SO CLEAR AND VIBRANT.
      
      
      I CAN PLAY ONLINE GAMES, DOWNLOAD MUSIC TO MY HEART?S CONTENT FROM THE NOKIA MUSIC STORE AND USE NOKIA MAPS &AMP; DRIVE TO REACH MY DESTINATIONS WITHOUT GETTING LOST. WITH NFC, WI-FI AND 3G SUPPORT, I HAVE A LOT OF CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS. I CAN CHARGE MY LUMIA 920 WIRELESSLY BY JUST LAYING IT ON ITS CHARGING PAD. NO MORE WIRES!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I AM TRUELY IN LOVE WITH MY LUMIA 920 YELLOW, FERRARI YELLOW TO BE PRECISE. THE PRODUCT IS BEAUTIFUL, AND WHEN U PLACE IT ALONG SIDE YOUR FRIEND'S SMARTPHONE YOU CAN SEE WHAT STANDS OUT. IT A HEAD TURNER, WHENEVER I AM IN PUBLIC AND TALKING OVER MY PHONE, PEOPLE DO NOTICE THE DEVICE IN YOUR HAND.
      
      
      AS FAR A THE PRODUCT IS CONCERNED, ITS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST SMARTPHONES IN THE MARKET. THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF PRODUCT JUST FEELS RIGHT IN YOUR AND AND GIVE YOU A FEEL THAT IT'S A SOLID PRODUCT AND WON'T BREAK IF IT HAPPEN TO FALL UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER HIGH-END SMARTPHONE. THE CAMERA IS BEST ON THE BLOCK AND LOW LIGHT PICTURES WILL SURPRISE YOU.
      
      
      ALSO MASSIVELY IMPRESSED BY FLIPKART SPEED OF DELIVERY. I GOT THE DEVICE IN LESS THAN 24 HRS, THAT'S AMAZING. I LOVE YOU FOLKS, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I DINT BUY THIS FROM FLIPKART, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS PHONE IS VERY AWESOME AND FEATURE LOADED.
      
      WP8 IS ALSO VERY GOOD AND NO WHERE COMPARABLE TO WP7.X.
      
      ALTHOUGH STILL LITTLE OPTIONS LIKE VIBRATION +RING ARE MISSING.
      
      THE ONLY DOWNSIDE FOR ME WAS ITS WEIGHT; BUT YOU GET USED TO IT WITHIN FEW HOURS."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I DONT KNOW HOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE NEGATIVE REVIEW HAVE EVER SEEN LUMIA 920 PERSONALLY, BUT IM WRITING THIS REVIEW ON MY BLACK BEAUTY, I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR MORETHAN A MONTH, SO, I REALLY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BEAUTY..
      
      
      TO ANSWER FEW OF THE POINTS RAISED BY PEOPLE,
      
      
      APPS:
      
      YES! AGREED APP CATALOGUE OF WP STORE IS TRAILING BEHIND IOS AND ANDROID, BUT WAIT, ALL THE APPS ARE MAKING THEIR OWN WAY TO WP. FEW TOP APPS ARE YET TO AVAILABLE IN WP BUT NEVERMIND WE'VE EQUAL COUNTER PARTS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE, YOU CAN LIVE WITH THOSE. INSTAGRAM, FORGET WE HAVE LOMOGRAM, FHOTOROOM, FANTASIA PAINTER FREE ARE AVAILABLE.
      
      
      GAMES:
      
      WHATEVER I SAID ABOVE WILL ALSO BE APPLICABLE FOR GAMES ALSO. JUST TO REMIND, THERE WASNT A SINGLE DAY IN LAST 50 DAYS WITHOUT A POPULAR GAME OR APP RELEASE FOR WP. IF YOU OWN A NOKIA, YOU DONT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT SCARCITY OF GAMES, NOKIA HAS RELEASED MORE EXCLUSIVE GAMES THAN MS ITSELF.
      
      
      BATTERY:
      
      SERIOUSLY!! THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT BATTERY, HAVE YOU EVER USED ANY SMARTPHONE OF HD SCREEN?? I DONT IT GIVES BACKUP FOR ETERNITY, BUT IT DOES LAST FOR A DAY, WHICH IS MORETHAN ENOUGH, RIGHT?
      
      
      SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS:
      
      YES! THERE ARE FEW SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS. BUT, THOSE ARW AFTERALL 'SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS' RIGHT, CAN BE FIXED BY AN UPDATE. WE NEED TO BEAR THOSE UNTIL THAT TIME.
      
      
      NOW, HERE COMES THE ADVANTAGES ON LUMIA SMARTPHONE OVER THE OTHERS,
      
      
      NOKIA EXCLUSIVE APPS:
      
      NOKIA NEVER FORGETS PEOPLE, YOUR LIFE BETTER AND HAPPIER WITH THE EXCLUSIVE APPS PROVIDED BY NOKIA, NOKIA MAPS AND DRIVE+ ARE THE BEST MAPPING MAPPING APPLICATIONS OUT THERE. YES! BETTER THAN GMAPS, GIVE A TRY YOU'LL COME TO KNOW. WITH JUST 500MB DOWNLOADED FILE, YOU CAN GET TURN BY TURN TO THE NAVIGATION TO THE FARTHEST CORNERS OF INDIA.
      
      
      AND A REFRESHING OS,
      
      HOW LONG WILL YOU LOOK AT THE DEAD GRID OF ICONS, GIVE SOME LIFE TO THEM, MOVE TO LIVE TILES ;). THOUGH THERE ARE FEW LIMITATIONS, THE OS IS FLUID, SMOOTH AND REFRESHING.
      
      
      FINALLY, ITS NOKIA THAT IS RUNNING THE OS NOT THE MS.
      
      WITH NOKIA, YOU CANT GO WRONG, AND NOKIA NEVER LEAVES THEIR CUSTOMERS ALONE..."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I FIRST WANTED TO BUY NOKIA LUMIA 800 IN DECEMBER, BUT THE PHONE WAS OUT OF STOCK THEN I WAITED FOR NOKIA LUMIA 820, PLACED AN ORDER, PAID THE AMOUNT WAITED FOR 10 DAYS FLIPKART CANCELLED MY ORDER BECAUSE THEY RAN OUT OF STOCK AS SOON AS I PLACED THE ORDER X( THEN I WAITED FOR LUMIA 820 FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS FINALLY SAW THIS BEAUTY IN STOCK ON 1ST OF FEB GOT IT A LITTLE LATE BUT EH I GOT IT FINALLY. WELL THE FLIPKART BOX WASN'T REALLY THAT GOOD I MEAN I HAVE HERD A LOT ABOUT FLIPKART THAT THEY DO THE PACKAGING REALLY WELL, WELL I THINK THEY MUST HATE ME THEY SENT THE PHONE IN A REALLY THIN BOX THANKS FOR THE BUBBLE RAP AROUND THE LUMIA'S BOX. OK ENOUGH ABOUT THE PACKAGING
      
      
      THE PHONE IS MORE THAN AWESOME... 8-O
      
      THE CAMERA, THE FULL HD VIDEO RECORDING ON BACK CAMERA, HD RECORDING ON FRONT CAMERA IT IS JUST AMAZING. YEAH IF YOU'RE AN ANDROID USER MAY BE YOU WONT LIKE THE PHONE THAT MUCH BECAUSE WINDOWS 8 DOES NOT GIVES YOU A LOT OF OPTION TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR PHONE. I HAVE USED 3-4 ANDROID PHONE AND I LOVED THEM BUT WHEN I USED WINDOWS PHONE 8 I FELT IS IT WAY BETTER THAN ANDROID. I AM IN LOVE WITH MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 (RED)
      
      
      THE APPLICATION MARKET.
      
      YEAH THE APPS AREN'T AS MUCH AS IOS NAD ANDROID MARKET BUT IT IS NOT THAT BAD AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS. I FOUND EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED.
      
      
      NO MEMORY SLOT?
      
      COME ON IT IS FREAKING 32 GB OF STORAGE, I MEAN HOW MUCH DO YOU EVEN WANT TO STORE ON THE PHONE? IT IS A FREAKING PHONE NOT YOUR PC!!! :P
      
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE EVEN THO IT WAS OUT OF MY BUDGET BUT I HAVE BOUGHT IT AND I DONT REGRET IT AT ALL. I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE. :)"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I GOT MY LUMIA 920 ABOUT A MONTH BACK. THE PHONE IS PRETTY HEAVY AND FEELS GOOD. STURDY AND DURABLE.
      
      
      THE CAMERA IS AWESOME, THE IPS SCREEN IS PRETTY GOOD. OF THE 20 ODD APPS I USED ON ANDROID, I JUST COULDNT LOCATE TWO. BUT THE STYLISH PHONE MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR IT.
      
      
      THIS IS THE BEST PHONE OUT THERE. GO FOR IT. YOU WILL THANK ME :)"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I HAD HATED MY NOKIA N97 DUE TO ITS FAULTY SOFTWARE. THE PHONE GOT NOKIA DOWN COMPLETELY. HAD DECIDED NEVER TO BUY A NOKIA PHONE BUT WHEN I HEARD ABOUT WINDOWS MARRIAGE WITH NOKIA, I STARTED MY BIT OF RESEARCH. I LOVED THE FACT THAT NOKIA REALIZED THEIR MISTAKE AND TOOK PREVENTIVE STEPS TO MAKE A COMEBACK....
      
      
      TODAY, I'M USING A NOKIA LUMIA 920 AND I FEEL I MADE A SENSIBLE CHOICE. THE HARDWARE AS USUAL IS GOOD. THE BODY LOOKS HOT AND CAN GIVE COMPLEX TO ANY SAMSUNG PHONE. THE SOFTWARE IS REFRESHING AND SIMPLE TO USE BUT IT NEEDS A BIT OF TUNING TIME AND AGAIN (WINDOWS ARE YOU LISTENING?)
      
      
      LOVE ALL THE NOKIA APPS, HONESTLY, THOSE APPS ARE PUSHING PEOPLE TO BUY THE PHONE. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MICROSOFT POWERED 'FACEBOOK'. THAT APP IS A MAJOR TURN OFF...(FB NEEDS TO DESIGN ITS OWN APP HERE). OTHERWISE, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT...
      
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY LUMIA 920 IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE A PHONE WITH CHEAP PLASTIC AND A COPIED OS (READ SAMSUNG) OR A PHONE THAT GIVES THE SAME OLD EXPERIENCE TO ITS USERS (READ IPHONE)"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR OVER 2 MONTHS NOW AND WOULD LIKE TO RATE IT 5 STARS NOW. PREVIOUSLY I HAD RATED IT 4 STARS, WITH ONE STAR DEDUCTED FOR BATTERY'S INCONSISTENCY. BUT SINCE I WAS PLAYING XBOX GAMES AS WELL, THOSE WERE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR DRAINING THE BATTERY. ONCE YOU LEARN THE ART OF MANAGING APPS, WIFI AND DATA NETWORK, BATTERY WOULD PERFORM BETTER, IT CERTAINLY WORKS BEST WITH WIFI.
      
      
      I LOVE THE UI, WHICH IS NOT MESSY LIKE THE ONE IN ANDROID PHONES, AND APPS ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH.
      
      
      I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT I WAS USING LUMIA 710 PREVIOUSLY, AND THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT UPGRADE FOR ME.
      
      
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      
      PROS:
      
      AWESOME DISPLAY AND BUILD QUALITY, WINDOWS 8, AMAZING CAMERA(SUPERB NIGHT TIME PICS), GENUINE PRICE, GREAT OVERALL EXPERIENCE. SOME OF THE NOKIA APPS ARE AWESOME (E.G. CITY LENS AND PANORAMA).
      
      WIRELESS CHARGER HELPS TOO. OVERALL, NOKIA HAS DELIVERED A WINNER WITH LUMIA 920.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      BATTERY BACKUP COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. SLIGHT HEATING ISSUE.
      
      
      OTHER THAN THESE ISSUES, THIS PHONE IS A KING. I LOVE MY LUMIA. PURCHASED IT FOR 35 K FROM FLIPKART, BUT PRICE WAS REDUCED NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER I GOT A FREE WIRELESS CHARGER."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I HAVE BOTH THE PHONES FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS (NOKIA L920 IS PERSONAL AND SIII FROM WORK) AND HERE IS WHAT I FEEL AS THE PROS AND CONS. FOR FULL DISCLOSURE, I AM BASED IN US WITH LTE ON BOTH PHONES.
      
      
      KEYBOARD: I LIKE NOKIA KEYBOARD ACCURACY MUCH BETTER THAN SIII IN TERMS OF TYPING ACCURACY AS WELL AS PREDICTIONS.
      
      BATTERY: NOKIA LASTS LONGER THAN SIII FOR SURE. IF I USE MY SIII HEAVILY, IT NEEDS CHARGING BY LATE AFTERNOON. ALSO, THE WIRELESS CHARGING ON L920 IS PRETTY COOL.
      
      APPS: GALAXY SIII DEFINITELY HAVE MORE, BUT 90% OF MY USAGE IS EMAILS, FACEBOOK, MUSIC, GAMES WHICH THE LIVE TILES ON 920 GIVE EASY ACCESS TO. ON GSIII, I USUALLY GET LOST ON THE CAROUSEL. THE GOOGLE ECOSYSTEM  (MAPS, STORE ETC.) IS GREAT, AND MICROSOFT/NOKIA IS NOT THERE YET. HOWEVER, I USE ONENOTE AND SKYDRIVE AND PERSONALLY, I FEEL THE EMAIL CLIENT ON NOKIA IS BETTER.
      
      
      BUILD QUALITY: NOKIA HANDS DOWN. THE CHEAP BATTERY COVER ON GSIII IS A DISGRACE TO FLAGSHIPS. THE CERAMIC BUTTONS ON THE 920 ARE SCRATCH FREE AND TOOK CARE OF ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES I HAD WITH MY PHONES-THAT IS SCRATCHING THE CHROME BUTTONS WITH MY NAILS. NOT ANYMORE ON L920.
      
      SCREEN: I LIKE BOTH, THE SMOOTH SCROLLING ON L920 IS REALLY NOTICEABLE. ALSO, L920 PERFORMS BETTER IN SUNLIGHT.
      
      WEIGHT: L920 IS A BIT ON THE HEAVY SIDE, GSIII IS DEFINITELY LIGHTER, SO LIGHT THAT I AM AFRAID TO PUT IT IN MY BACK POCKET THAT I MAY BREAK IT INTO TWO WHILE SITTING.
      
      
      CAMERA: BOTH HAVE GREAT CAMERAS AND HAVE THEIR OWN ADVANTAGES. L920 CAMERA PERFORMS BETTER IN LOW LIGHT, BUT GSIII CAMERA IS VERY VIBRANT FOR NORMAL LIGHTING.
      
      
      HARDWARE SPECS AND OS: YOU CANNOT LOOK AT THE TWO SEPARATELY. ANDROID HAS IMPROVED OVER THE YEARS IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, BUT THE GSIII STILL STUTTERS ONCE IN A WHILE. THE OS STILL HAVE SOME NIGGLES AND REMINDS ME OF OLD SYMBIAN-JACK OF ALL TRADES, BUT NOT A MASTER BY ANY MEANS. THE OS IS PRETTY HARDWARE INTENSIVE, WHICH IS WHY ANDROID MANUFACTURERS KEEP BUMPING THE SPECS TO OVERCOME THIS WEAKNESS. THE MORE HEAVY THE SPECS, THE MORE BATTERY IT USES AND OBVIOUSLY IT SHOWS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WP8 IS SO SMOOTH AND LIGHT, IT IS SUCH A PLEASURE TO USE. IT IS NOT CUSTOMIZABLE AS ANDROID, BUT THE USER EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST AMONG ALL OS, BAR NONE. FOR THE SAME HARDWARE, WP8 WILL DEFINITELY PERFORM BETTER THAN ANDROID."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I HAVE NOT BOUGHT THIS PHONE BUT SINCE BEING A TECH GUY I HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS PHONE NUMBER OF TIMES TO CHECK HOW IT WORKS.
      
      I MUTS SAY THAT NOKIA HAS GONE THROUGH LOTS OF HARDWORK TO RELEASE A PHONE LIKE LUMIA 920. THIS PHONE IS COMPARED WITH ANDROID AND IOS, BUT TO NOTICE IS THAT IT HAS GOT ALL WHAT A USER NEEDS. THIS IS A DIFFERENT PHONE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE SAME LOOKING OS ON EACH PHONE. I'LL NOT GO INTO SPECS OF THIS PHONE AS EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT BUT YES WOULD REQUEST MS IF THEY ARE RELEASING A NEWER VERSION OF WIN 8 OS ALL THE WP SHOULD GET A FREE UPDATES."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I NORMALLY DONT LIKE APPLE'S IPHONE BECAUSE OF ITS MONOTONOUS BEHAVIOUR AND CONTROL OF APPLE OVER YOU USAGE PATTERN. THE ANDROIDS ARE JUST TOO LAGGY AND BUGGY AND SINCE ITS AN OPEN SOURCE, IT ATTRACTS MALWARE..
      
      
      WP GIVES YOU BEST OF BOTH WORLDS... SIMPLICITY OF IOS WITH SOME CUSTOMIZATION AND NO LAGS DURING USE. PEOPLE WILL COMPARE GHZSS OF DUAL CORE, QUAD CORE &AMP; NOW OCTA-CORE PROCESSORS WITH THIS ONE BUT THEY FORGET THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICAL. IMO, WP HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT IT DOES NOT NEED SO MANY CORES &AMP; IT WILL STILL WORK SMOOTHLY UNLIKE THOSE CORE OS PROCESSORS WHICH STILL CANT KEEP ANDROID STABLE AFTER THREE MONTHS OF USE.
      
      YOU WILL HARDLY FEEL ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LOW END LUMIA 520 VS HIGH END 920 SIMPLY BECAUSE OF OS.
      
      LAST TUESDAY MY ONE YEAR OLD ANDROID DIED AND I SWITCHED TO LUMIA 920 PURCHASED FROM A NOKIA PRIORITY DEALER AND I CANT BE MORE THAN HAPPY WITH THE CHANGE
      
      
      PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A SMOOTH EXPERIENCE PLS GO FOR IT &AMP; PEOPLE LOOKING FOR CORES OF PROCESSORS AND PLASTIC BODIES CAN FOR FOR S******"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I ORDERED THIS PHONE THROUGH FLIPKART ON 01-JUN-2013 AND GOT IT DELIVERED AT MY OFFICE TODAY (05-JUN-2013). I WAS HESITANT AT FIRST TO ORDER THE LUMIA 920 MAINLY BECAUSE IT IS A WINDOWS PHONE. BUT AFTER A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET I WAS CONVINCED THAT THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 WILL BE THE PERFECT REPLACEMENT FOR MY TRUSTED NOKIA E7. IT HAS JUST BEEN A COUPLE OF HOURS SINCE I STARTED USING THE LUMIA 920 AND I MUST SAY THAT THE PHONE IS SIMPLY AMAZING. NOKIA, AS ALWAYS, HAS MADE THE ULTIMATE MOBILE DEVICE."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I PRE-ORDERED THIS PHONE WHEN IT WAS LAUNCHED IN THE US.. AND I DON'T REGRET MY DECISION ONE BIT.
      
      
      ABOUT THE PHONE BEING HEAVY.. WELL THIS IS A SOLID PHONE.. I HAVEN'T USED A CASE SINCE I BOUGHT IT IN DECEMBER...AND THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SCRATCH..
      
      
      THE CAMERA IS WAY AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION..
      
      
      I RECENTLY STARTED USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FROM THE PHONE..AND NOW IT HAS COMPLETELY REPLACED BY TOM TOM..YES IT IS THAT GOOD AND IT IS FREE..
      
      
      THE LIVE TILES IS A NICE CHANGE FROM THE DRAB SCREEN DESIGNS.. WE HAVE FOR ANDROID AND APPLE..
      
      
      I WAS INITIALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE WIRELESS CHARGING..BUT NOT SO MUCH NOW.. IT IS SOMETHING AESTHETIC ..NOTHING MORE.. DOES GIVE IT THE WOW FACTOR THOUGH..
      
      
      THE TWO THINGS I DONT LIKE ABOUT THE PHONE
      
      
      1. THE TOUCH SENSITIVE BUTTONS AT THE BOTTOM.. I HAVE ACCIDENTLY PRESSED THOSE BUTTONS TOO MANY TIMES..
      
      
      2. THERE IS NO WAY TO KILL A PROGRAM DIRECTLY.. HAVE TO USE THE BACK BUTTON...
      
      
      I HAVE AN APPLE IPAD, IPHONE 5(USED FOR A MONTH AND SENT IT TO MY BROTHER IN INDIA).. USED THE SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB(FOR 4 MONTHS) AND NOW THIS WINDOWS PHONE.. I MUST SAY..
      
      
      USER INTERFACE .. APPLE &GT;&GT; WINDOWS &GT;&GT; ANDROID
      
      
      BUILD QUALITY.. NOKIA &GT;&GT; APPLE &GT;&GT; SAMSUNG
      
      
      NOW TO THE STORE..
      
      
      THE STORE IS NOT AS FILLED WITH APPS LIKE ANDROID OR IOS.. BUT IT IS GETTING THERE.. ALL POPULAR APPS
      
      
      FACEBOOK..(FROM MICROSOFT)
      
      SKYPE
      
      WHATSAPP
      
      PANDORA (WITHOUT ADS)
      
      METROTUBE (THE BEST YOUTUBE APP ACROSS ALL OS)
      
      
      ALL ARE THERE..
      
      
      IF GIVEN A CHOICE AGAIN.. WOULD I BUY THIS PHONE OVER THE APPLE AND SAMSUNG.. A CERTAINLY YES..
      
      
      FOR THE BUILD QUALITY.. PEOPLE CAN LOOK UP THE KNIFE TEST ON YOUTUBE...IT'S TRULY SHOCKING.."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I READ PEOPLE CRYING ABOUT CORES, LET ME CLEAR IT UP, IT HAS SNAPDRAGON S4 DUAL CORE, A15 BASED KRAIT, WHICH OUTPERFORMS GALAXY S3'S QUAD CORE EXYNOS 4412 BASED ON ARM A9 ARCHITECTURE. 1GB RAM? IT'S NOT ANDROID, WE DON'T NEED MORE RAM THAN THAT FOR A WP. GO BUY  THE UPCOMING SGS4 WITH EIGHT CORES IF YOUR PHONE DECISIONS DEPEND ON NO. OF CORES.
      
      
      REGARDING LUMIA 920, IT'S JUST AMAZING, I HAVE OWNED 3 ANDROID FLAGSHIPS, WAS A BIG ANDROID FANBOY, BUT THIS EXPOSURE TO WP HAS CHANGED MY MIND. I'M IN LOVE WITH IT. I'M A BIG TIME POWER USER(ROOT USER ON ANDROID) AND SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, I DON'T MISS APPS ON WP8."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS DEVICE, I DID 1 MONTH OF RESEARCH TO FIND A REPLACEMENT FOR MY IPHONE 5 AND FINALLY CHOOSE THE LUMIA 920. I MUST ADMIT ITS A GREAT DEVICE AND I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS DEVICE. AS SOME BLOGS MAY SAY THE 180 GRAMS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM AT ALL. IT FITS PERFECTLY INTO THE POCKET. THE CAMERA IS AWESOME EVEN IN PITCH DARK WITHOUT A FLASH THE IMAGES ARE AS GOOD AS TAKEN IN THE DAY TIME.. NO PHONE CAMERA CAN BE COMPARED TO THIS WHEN I SAY THIS THIS INCLUDES IPHONE 5 TOO. BATTERY LIFE IS VERY GOOD, NO DROPPING OF SIGNALS. NOKIA AND WINDOWS IS A GREAT ONE TO HAVE. OVERALL I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I WANTED TO GET MYSELF SOMETHING THAT WOULD PROVIDE ME WITH UNLIMITED JOY. I ZEROED IN ON THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 BECAUSE I THINK IT COMPLETES ME IN EVERY SENSE. THE FEATURE SET IS RICH AND THE PHONE ITSELF LOOKS SO AWESOME, THAT I COULD NOT RESIST POSSESSING IT. RIGHT SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT MY LUMIA 920, I HAVE BEEN IN AWE OF IT AND HAVE SPENT HOURS EXPLORING ITS MANY FEATURES.
      
      
      PHOTOGRAPHY COMES NATURALLY TO ME AND I HAVE EARNED GENEROUS PRAISE FOR MY CANDID PHOTOS. MY LUMIA 920 ALLOWS ME TO PURSUE THIS PASSION WITH ITS INTEGRATED 8.7 MP REAR CAMERA. WITH THE INCORPORATED PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND THE CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS, ALL MY SNAPS ARE RENDERED WITH LIFELIKE QUALITY. OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION REDUCES BLUR IN MY PHOTOS AS WELL AS VIDEOS. I CAN EVEN RECORD 1080P HD VIDEOS. THE SMARTSHOOT DIGITAL LENS LETS ME COMPOSE PERFECT GROUP SHOTS WITHOUT HAVING TO ARRANGE AND REARRANGE THE GROUP. IT CLICKS MULTIPLE SHOTS OF THE SAME SUBJECT AND LETS ME PICK AND CHOOSE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS TO CREATE A PERFECT SHOT. WITH CINEMAGRAPH, I CAN ANIMATE STILL IMAGES WITH HILARIOUS RESULTS. THE DUAL LED FLASH RENDERS BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE DARK TO PROVIDE CRYSTAL CLEAR SNAPS.
      
      
      WHEN WANTING TO VIEW IMAGES, MY FRIENDS FLOCK AROUND ME TO TAKE A PEEK AT THE SNAP ON THE 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY. IT IS ULTRA-RESPONSIVE AND INTEGRATES PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY FOR BETTER CLARITY. IT IS PROTECTED BY CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 TECHNOLOGY SO THAT I HAVE COMPLETE PEACE OF MIND. I CAN PLAY GAMES AND DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM THAT OFFERS SEAMLESS NAVIGATION AND IS REFRESHINGLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CURRENT CROP OF OSS. PEOPLEHUB LETS ME ACCESS SOCIAL NETWORKING UPDATES DIRECTLY FROM THE HOME SCREEN MAKING ME A SOCIAL PERSON, SOMEONE I HAD NEVER BEEN PREVIOUSLY! THE SLIM UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN OF MY LUMIA 920 ADDS TO MY PERSONALITY.
      
      AT WORK, MY BOSS APPRECIATES MY PUNCTUALITY IN REPLYING TO CLIENT EMAILS. I DO IT DUE TO THE MS OFFICE SUITE SUPPORT ON MY LUMIA 920. MS OFFICE DOCUMENT EDITING, PDF VIEWING AND SUPPORT FOR MS OUTLOOK IS THE SECRET BEHIND MY SUCCESS. I CAN BLAZE THROUGH APPS AS MY LUMIA 920 IS EQUIPPED WITH A DUAL CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON KRAIT MOBILE PROCESSOR, THE ADRENO 225 GPU AND 1 GB RAM. THE 32 GB OF ON-BOARD STORAGE SPACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR ME TO STORE ALL MY NECESSARY DATA; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL ON MY PHONE.
      
      
      I AM HAPPY TO EXPLORE MY ADVENTUROUS SIDE AS I CAN TRAVEL TO NEW DESTINATIONS USING THE NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE APPS ON MY LUMIA 920. THEY PROVIDE ME WITH TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATION EVEN WHEN I AM NOT SUBSCRIBED TO DATA USAGE. THERE IS NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN MY LIFE, THANKS TO NOKIA MUSIC AND NOKIA MIX RADIO. I CAN CHOOSE FROM OVER 150 PROFESSIONALLY MIXED PLAYLISTS OR COMPOSE MY OWN TOO.
      
      I CAN EXCHANGE STUFF WITH FRIENDS DUE TO MY LUMIA 920?S NFC, WI-FI, BLUETOOTH AND OTHER CONNECTIVITY FEATURES."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I WAS AT MY DAUGHTER?S SONG RECITAL, AND WHEN MY LITTLE ONE TOOK CENTRE-STAGE I WHIPPED OUT MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 AND SNAPPED OFF SOME AMAZING SHOTS. THOSE PHOTOS CAME OUT WONDERFUL, BUT THE BEST PART OF THE EVENING WAS THE GLARES OF ADMIRATION AND ENVY I GOT FROM THE OTHER PARENTS FOR MY NOKIA SMARTPHONE. YES, MY LUMIA 920 HAS THAT EFFECT. DRAPED IN A STUNNING YELLOW UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE SHELL, IT JUST LOOKS STUNNING. I REMEMBER SWOONING AT THE SITE OF THIS PHONE AT THE NOKIA GALLERY AND PESTERING MY HUBBY TO BUY IT FOR ME. WHEN THE SALES EXECUTIVE EXPLAINED THE LUMIA 920?S FEATURES TO ME, MY HUSBAND SAYS MY EYES GREW LARGER AND WIDER BY THE SECOND! IT?S BEEN SOME DAYS SINCE THAT, AND I HAVE GROWN USED TO THE CUTTING-EDGE FEATURES ON MY PHONE. REMEMBER MY DAUGHTER?S AWESOME RECITAL SNAPS I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THAT WAS COURTESY THE 8.7 MP CAMERA ON MY LUMIA 920. IT COMES AUGMENTED WITH CARL ZEISS TESSAR OPTICS, OPTICAL IMAGES STABILISATION AND PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY. EVEN WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT IN THE AUDITORIUM, MY PHONE?S DUAL LED FLASH DID THE TRICK AND JUST LIT THE PLACE UP FOR THAT PERFECT SNAP.
      
      BACK HOME, I SHOWED THE PHOTOS TO MY HUBBY ON THE LARGE 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY. WITH THE INTEGRATED PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY, THE RENDERING OF VISUALS IS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVERY IMAGE AND VIDEO FEELS TRUE-TO-LIFE. MY HUSBAND WAS INITIALLY SCEPTICAL ABOUT ME HANDLING THIS DEVICE, BUT ONCE THE EXECUTIVE TOLD HIM ABOUT THE CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION ON THE SCREEN, HE LET OUT A SIGH OF RELIEF. IT HAS REALLY SUSTAINED SOME ROUGH USE BY ME AND HAS STILL RESISTED SCRATCHES. WITH THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM, I CAN FIND ALL THE APPS I NEED RIGHT AT MY FINGERTIPS ON THE HOME SCREEN. ALL MY CONTACTS TOO RESIDE THERE WITH THE PEOPLE HUB FEATURE THAT LETS ME CATCH UP WITH THEIR LATEST SOCIAL NETWORKING UPDATES. MY LITTLE ONE FREQUENTLY COMES UP TO ME WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT HER SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS AND WE HAVE A GALA TIME TRYING TO SEARCH THE WEB FOR ANSWERS. I CAN STREAM MULTIMEDIA CONTENT AND SHOW MY ANGEL ALL THE EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS I NEED WITHOUT ANY IRRITATING BUFFERS OR LAGS. MY HUBBY TELLS ME ALL THIS POWER IN MY LUMIA 920 COMES FROM A DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR COMBINED WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM.
      
      OUR LITTLE FAMILY LOVES TAKING RANDOM TRIPS TO NATURAL SURROUNDINGS OR EXOTIC LOCALES, AND THIS IS WHERE MY LUMIA 920?S NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE APPS COME IN HANDY. THEY OFFER ACCURATE TURN-BY-TURN DIRECTIONS LETTING US REACH OUR DESTINATIONS ON TIME AND WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ASKING ANY DIRECTIONS. I CAN CHARGE MY PHONE WIRELESSLY AS IT CAN BE JUST LAID ON A FATBOY PILLOW OR A CHARGING BASE. NO MORE HASSLES OF LOCATING THE CHARGER WHEN THE BATTERY?S DYING!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I WAS EARLIER REALLY CONFUSED TO GO FOR ANDROID OR WINDOWS (KEEPING APART THE GIANT APPLE OUT, BECAUSE I LOVED IPHONE5(COST FACTOR SADDENS :( ) AFTER GETTING USED TO WINDOWS AND BEAUTIFUL LUMIA 920, I AM REALLY FLABBERGASTED BY THE LOOKS, THE FEATURES, THE ATTRIBUTES AND QUALITIES ETC. ITS SO SO SO GOOD. I AM NOW HAVING THIS PHONE FOR THE LAST 4 MONTHS, BELIEVE ME NEVER EVER IT HAS HANGED. I AM A HARDCORE GAMER AND EXCLUSIVE FEATURE USER.
      
      
      I FIND THE EXTREME GAMES RUNNING SMOOTHLY AND APPLICATIONS BEHAVING LIKE WATER, SO SMOOTH.
      
      EXCELLENT PRODUCT TO HAVE."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I WAS LOOKING FOR WHAT'S CALLED A PHONE AFTER DEALING WITH ANDROID. THIS IS IT.
      
      BRING AN ANDROID ""SUPER HI-FI"" CONFIG PHONE AND LUMIA 920 HAND IN HAND. I HAVE JUST GONE BY THE PERFORMANCE, AND NOKIA LUMIA 920 DELIVERED (COMPARED TO XPERIA Z, NOTE II, ETC). YOU WONT AT ANY POINT FEEL LIKE THE PHONE IS LAGGY (FINALLY FREE FROM THE ANDROID LAGS). I THINK WINDOWS HAS DONE ITS JOB WELL (SURPRISED TO SAY THIS, BUT TRUE).
      
      MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE PRODUCT IS A COMPLETE ONE. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE YOU ARE HOLDING SPECIFICATIONS IN YOUR HAND WITH CHEAP PLASTIC WRAPPED AROUND IT OR A BABY HOLDING A TOY, YOU FEEL IT AS A PHONE, NICE CAMERA, NICE FINISH AND EXTREMELY GOOD DISPLAY.
      
      
      NOKIA KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A PHONE AND OPTED FOR THINGS (THAT YOU USE REALLY AND JUST NOT BOAST) THAT MAKE IT A GOOD PHONE RATHER THAN SELLING SPECS.
      
      
      I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT I DIDN'T BUY THE PHONE IN FLIPKART EVEN IF THEY ARE OFFERING A BETTER PRICE, I JUST COULDN'T RESIST, PAID MORE AND GOT IT ON SPOT TO AVOID DELIVERY TIME :P"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I WAS USING ANDROID OS BASED PHONES SINCE LAST 04 YEARS AND THIS IS MY FIRST HAND ON EXPERIENCE ON WINDOWS OS.
      
      DESIGN: THIS PHONE IS A AWESOME PIECE OF DESIGN, ENGINEERING AND CRAFTSMAN SHIP BY NOKIA. A POLY-CARBONATE BODY IS EXCELLENT AND RESISTING ALMOST EVERY SCRATCH. SCREEN SIZE AND RESOLUTION IS WONDERFUL, UNLIKE OTHER NOKIA PHONES THIS PHONE IS QUITE TOUCH SENSITIVE AND RESPONSIVE AND GLASS HAS EXCELLENT CAPABILITY TO AVOID ANY KIND OF SCRATCHES.
      
      OS:  AS I EXPERIENCED, WINDOWS OS IS A 'NO KIDDING' OS UNLIKE ANDROID. ALTHOUGH I FOUND ALMOST EVERY APPLICATION AND GAMES WHICH I USED TO USE ON MY ANDROID PHONE.
      
      BATTERY: AS LIKE EVERY LARGE SCREEN SMART PHONES, IT WORK FOR YOU FOR A DAY IN NORMAL USE CONDITION, WHICH IS NOT BAD.
      
      OVERALL: PROS: SUPERB BUILT QUALITY, EXCELLENT SCREEN, GOOD BATTERY, IMPRESSIVE LOOKS, NOKIA NAVIGATION AND MAPS.
      
      CON: EXPENSIVE, PROCESSOR COULD BE FASTER AND LACK OF NUMBERS OF APPS ON NOKIA STORE SPECIALLY MISSING YOU TUBE."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I'M A STUDENT OF SCITECH AND I WANTED A PHONE THAT WOULD SIMPLIFY MY LIFE BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF THINGS I CARRY AROUND IN MY POCKET: TO MERGE A PHONE WITH GOOD RECEPTION, A GREAT CAMERA (CAN SNEAKILY TAKE GREAT PICTURES INSIDE CLASSROOMS EVEN!), A MINI-TABLET THAT READS, WRITES, TAKES NOTES, TRANSLATES ETC, AND EASILY SYNCHS WITH MY LAPTOP. ALSO, INCREDIBLY DURABLE.
      
      
      THE NATURAL CHOICE WAS THE BEST PHONE NOKIA COULD MAKE - FROM PAST EXPERIENCE - AND LUCKILY, IT COMES WITH A GREAT CAMERA.
      
      
      AM I SATISFIED? WELL, HERE ARE THE GOOD POINTS:
      
      
      1)AMAZING TOUCH SENSITIVITY (I CAN NAVIGATE WITH MY FINGER 1MM OFF THE SCREEN) AND RESPONSE - FEELS GREAT TO OWN
      
      
      2)GOOD STORAGE 32GB
      
      
      3)GOOD BATTERY - IT ONLY EATS THE BATTERY WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING GAMES, BUT PERFORMS REASONABLY WELL WITH MOVIES AND YOU CAN HEAR SONGS ON IT ALL DAY. INTERNET SURFING TIME IS PRETTY DECENT. OVERNIGHT, IT WAS CONNECTED TO WIFI AND UPDATED ALL APPS- I HAVE A LOT OF APPS - AND SYNCHED FACEBOOK AND GMAIL - AFTER 24HRS IT HAD LOST 1% BATTERY... BRILLIANT!
      
      
      4) VERY DECENT CAMERA WITH GOOD APPS (LOOK UP NOKIA LENSES). ANDROID MAY HAVE MORE VARIETY THOUGH BUT THEN, THE QUALITY OF IMAGES IS BRILLIANT ONLY ON THE 920 OVERALL, IF YOU CONSIDER IMAGE RESOLUTION, QUALITY, AND STABILIZATION. THERE IS A BUTTON FOR CAMERA AND THE CAMERA CAN BE ACCESSED EVEN WHEN THE SCREEN IS LOCKED WITH A LONG PRESS OF THE BUTTON - I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU WILL APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS.
      
      
      5) I LIKE THE TILES - LIFE IS A LOT MORE SIMPLER, BUT MISS THE LIVE-WALLPAPER ON ANDROIDS (NOT LIKE I USED IT ANYWAY, TO CONSERVE BATTERY!) THE INTERFACE IS VERY SIMPLIFIED AND NOTHING REALLY IS MISSING, UNLESS YOU ARE A HELLBENT ON HAVING THE ANDROID SCREENS. IN FACT, THERE IS A NICE FEATURE CALLED ""HUBS"" WHICH GROUPS DIFFERENT KINDS OF APPS TOGETHER, WHICH DOES LOOK LIKE THE ANDROID OR IOS SHELLS - BUT YOU CAN'T MODIFY IT. STILL, LIFE IS SIMPLER - THE PRE-PROGRAMMED GROUPING IS CONVENIENT.
      
      
      6) I KNOW THE APPS ARE TERRIBLY INCOMPETENT COMPARED TO ANDROID BUT FACE IT - THE GROWTH CURVE IS SHARPER FOR WP8. I LIKE THE APPS (BUT MOST OF THE GOOD ONES ARE NOT FREE, SO BEWARE). MOST OF THE ONES IMPORTANT TO ME ARE THERE. THE NOKIA SPECIFIC APPS ARE COOL ESPECIALLY CITYSCAPE. SO DONT GET VERY WORRIED THAT WP8 IS PRIMITIVE COMPARED TO ANDRD AND IOS (READ: 10 WINDOWS PHONE 8 FEATURES THAT WOULD MAKE ANDROID EVEN SWEETER BY KAVAFIAN)
      
      
      7) SYNCHS PRETTY WELL WITH WINDOWS7
      
      
      8) LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, LOOKS AMAZING (I HAVE MATTE BLACK), IS VERY STRONG AND IT'S A LITTLE HEAVY BUT UNLIKE WHAT I FEARED - YOU DON'T FEEL THE WEIGHT, EVEN IN YOUR POCKET. IT'S ABOUT 50-60G HEAVIER THAN WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE USED TO. CMON, THAT'S SERIOUSLY NOT MUCH!
      
      
      SOME DRAWBACKS.
      
      
      1) NON-REMOVABLE BATTERY, SO YOU CANNOT CARRY A SPARE ONE AROUND.
      
      2) HEATS UP RANDOMLY - WHILE WIRELESSLY CHARGING, WHILE PLAYING FOR SOME WHILE...
      
      THESE ARE SYNONYMOUS WITH THOSE OF OTHER HIGHEND, HEAVYDUTY SMARTPHONES ALSO. WE'VE BEEN REDUCED TO PEOPLE WHO NEED TO CHARGE EVERYDAY AND HAVE STARTED CALLING A GOOD BATTERY ONE WHICH SEES YOU THROUGH AN ENTIRE DAY. WELL, IF YOU AREN'T GAMING, LM920 IS GOOD IN THAT RESPECT, BUT AN HOUR IDLING AWAY PLAYING GAMES IS A SERIOUS ISSUE - EATS UP 20-30%!
      
      
      3) ONE TERRIBLE SHORTAGE...
      
      THERE IS NO ****** DOCUMENT MANAGER. SURE IT READS YOUR PDF'S AND AFTER A LABOURIOUS PROCESS, READS YOUR EPUBS ALSO, BUT WHAT SUCKS IS THAT YOU CANNOT MANAGE ALL THESE IN FOLDERS! SO IF YOU ARE LIKE ME - THIS MEANS SCROLLING THROUGH ABOUT 4000 FILES IN ONE LIST (HAVEN'T UPLOADED THEM YET FOR THIS PRECISE REASON). I WOULD REALLY LIKE A FOLDER SYSTEM - WP8 DEVELOPPERS DO SOMETHING!THIS IS WHY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND A WP8, NOT JUST THE LUMIA 920.
      
      
      SO AM I IN LOVE WITH LM920? YES! BUT GIVEN A CHANCE TO GET THE MONEY BACK AND INVEST IN A DIFFERENT PHONE (LIKE SAMSUNG NOTE2?) WOULD I DO IT? YES. DEFINITELY. THIS IS BECAUSE I REALLY MISS THE FOLDER SYSTEM AND THE LM920 IS MAKING LIFE HARD HERE. ALTHOUGH, IT'S REALLY FANCY AND WILL SERVE ME WELL IN PARTIES AND TRAVEL TRIPS (AS LONG AS I CARRY A CHARGER). SO YEAH, IF YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THESE CONS - LM920 IS THE PHONE YOU WANT."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"I'M WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER A WEEK OF USAGE WITH MY BLACK LUMIA 920. THE PHONE IS HAVING VERY GOOD BUILD QUALITY AND IS THERE TO LAST. I HAVEN'T FELT ANY DISCOMFORT WITH THE WEIGHT RATHER IT GIVES A PREMIUM FEEL.(PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE USED S3 AND IPHONE4). THE OS IS A NEW AND PLEASANT EXPERIENCE AND IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO GET USED TO BUT ONCE YOU DO, YOU'LL START LOVING IT. THE USER INTERFACE IS GREAT AND RESPONDS VERY WELL WITHOUT ANY DELAY. AND I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO GO AND READ THE USER GUIDE AT THE NOKIA SITE -THERE IS ONE IN THE PHONE AS WELL- TO KNOW MANY MINUTE YET SIGNIFICANT DETAILS. REGARDING THE APPS, I'M SATISFIED WITH THE CURRENT COLLECTION AS IT SERVES MY PURPOSE WELL. AND I STRONGLY FEEL THIS WP8 PLATFORM WILL BRING IN MORE COOL FEATURES GOING FORWARD.
      
      
      NOTE: I HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE BATTERY LIFE INITIALLY WITH THE BATTERY GETTING DRAINED QUICKLY. BUT IT WAS OUT OF MY IGNORANCE; THE TIPS ON EXTENDING BATTERY LIFE MENTIONED IN THE GUIDE AS WELL AS SOME GOOGLING HELPED ME SORT OUT THE PROBLEMS AND ALL IS WELL NOW.
      
      
      GOOD
      
      1) SCREEN - EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AND TOUCH SENSITIVITY
      
      2) CAMERA - VERY GOOD LOW LIGHT PICS, SMART SHOOT, CINEMAGRAPH, PHOTOBEAMER ETC
      
      3) NOKIA MUSIC - UNIQUE AND ONE OF A KIND EXPERIENCE.
      
      4) NAVIGATION - NOKIA MAPS, DRIVE, CITY LENS
      
      5) MS OFFICE
      
      6) SPECS - DUAL CORE PROCESSOR WITH 1GB MEMORY IS SUFFICIENT ENOUGH FOR A SMART PHONE IN MY OPINION FOR CURRENT GENERATION USE. ULTIMATELY, ITS UP TO THE OS AND THE APPS TO MAKE USE OF IT AND WP8 SHINES IN THIS DEPARTMENT.
      
      
      NOT SO GOOD
      
      1) MUSIC PLAYER - THE INTERFACE FOR PLAYBACK AND ITS CONTROLS IS NOT SO GOOD.
      
      
      BAD
      
      NONE SO FAR :)"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"INITIALLY I WAS CONFUSED WHETHER TO GO FOR IPHONE 5 OR LUMIA 920, BUT I TRIED MY HANDS ON  WITH LUMIA 920 AND IT COMPLETELY BLEW MY MIND.!! BUTTER SMOOTH UI  AND SUPER RESPONSIVE TOUCH WITH GREAT POLYCARBONATE BODY.. MADE IT IDEAL FOR MY DAILY USE. BEFORE BUYING,  I COMPARED THE ANDRIOID STORE, IOS STORE AND THE WINDOWS STORE, SO AS TO GET A BETTER IDEA ON THE APP POPULATION, MY ONLY CONCLUSION WAS THAT, MICROSOFT AND NOKIA HAVE COME OF THE AGE, THE APPS ARE SURPRISING GOOD AND MOST OF THE MATURE (REAL USEFUL) APPS ARE ALREADY THERE ON WINDOWS!... I WATCHED TON'S OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS BEFORE FINALISING ON THIS AND MY GOD! I AM THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED.. IT JUST KICKS THE IPHONE AND S3 HARD!
      
      
      THE CAMERA ON THIS PHONE IS A MONSTER AND YOU CAN REALLY CLICK SOME FABULOUS SHOTS WITH IT.
      
      ALL IN ALL.. GO FOR THIS PRODUCT.. IF YOU ARE REALLY BORED WITH UI OF ANDROID AND IOS.. WHICH ARE SAME ON EVERY PHONE.. ALSO, THE BUILD QUALITY IS JUST TOO GOOD, (I AM USING MY KEYS AS STYLUS WITHOUT ANY WORRY FOR SCRATCHES.. )
      
      AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE APPS, THEY ARE AMPLE AND SUFFICIENT.. TRY AND IT AND YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT..
      
      
      KUDOS TO NOKIA AND MICROSOFT!!.. CHEERS!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"LUMIA 920 IS AWESOME......,I JUST LIKE IT.IT HAS GD SOUND,GD SPEED WITH 1.5 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR,AWESOME CAMRA.BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD,4.5INCH HD+ CAPACITIVE TOUCH SCREEN,WINDOWS 8,X-BOX GAMING,COMMUNITIES,AWESOME LOOKING HOME SCREEN,ETC..."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"MY MOM SURPRISED ME WITH A GIFT THAT STOLE MY BREATH AWAY! A BRAND NEW NOKIA LUMIA 920 FOR SCORING THE BEST IN MY GRADS! I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS PHONE IS JUST AWESOME. ITS 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR IN THE SUNLIGHT TOO AND GAVE AMAZING VIEWING ABILITY. IT TOOK JUST ONE SWIPE TO OPEN THE MENU. TODAY I KNOW IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY THAT IS PROTECTED BY CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2! THIS WAS THE BEST GIFT I HAD EVER RECEIVED!  INSIDE ITS SLEEK UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN, IS A SUPER FAST WORKING, DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR THAT COMBINES WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. ADD TO THAT A BRILLIANT WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM THAT MAKES APPS COME ALIVE ON SCREEN. UPDATING FACEBOOK STATUS AND STAYING CONNECTED WITH FRIENDS IS EASY AS THE PEOPLE HUB APP PINS UPDATES ON THE SCREEN. I LIKE TO UPDATE LATEST TILES ON SCREEN AND APPRECIATE THE CREATIVE DESIGNS TOO.
      
      MICROSOFT OFFICE DOCUMENTS AND PDF FILES CAN BE VIEWED AND EDITED ON MY PHONE TOO. THIS MAKES IT A GREAT PHONE FOR AN INTERN LIKE ME WHO IS WORKING ON DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND NEEDS TO CONSTANTLY STAY ONLINE AND CHECK FOR VARIOUS CHANGES. ACCESSING THE INTERNET VIA 3G IS EASY AND CONVENIENT. MY PHONE ALSO SUPPORTS NFC IN ADDITION TO THAT. CONNECTIVITY IS NO ISSUE AT ALL FOR ME. MY PC?S BROADBAND CONNECTION MAY GET STUCK OR PLAY HARD BALL BUT NOT MY PHONE?S INTERNET. I CAN USE THE LTE SERVICES ALONG WITH NFC, WI-FI, WLAN AND BLUETOOTH FOR DATA TRANSFER TOO. I?M A PHOTOGRAPHY BUFF REALLY SPEAKING. THIS PHONE WAS A GIFT AND THANK GOD, MY MOM KNEW IF I WANTED A PHONE IT HAD TO HAVE AN AWESOME CAMERA. MY WISH CAME TRUE AS THE PHONE HAS AN 8.7 MP CAMERA EQUIPPED WITH A STATE-OF-THE-ART CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS! THE PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO HAZY PICTURES OR VIDEOS. I CAPTURE REALITY AT ITS BEST EVEN AT NIGHT AS THIS PHONE HAS A DUAL LED FLASH THAT IS SUPER POWERFUL.  MUSIC IS MY SECOND LOVE AND I?M THE HAPPIEST WHEN I GET TO DOWNLOAD LOADS OF CLASSIC SONGS FROM THE NOKIA MUSIC STORE! WITH NOKIA MIX RADIO, I?M CREATING MY COLLECTION OF THE BEST CLASSICS EVER ON THIS AWESOME PHONE.  CHARGING MY PHONE DOES NOT REQUIRE IT TO BE PLUGGED IN. I JUST HAVE TO LAY THE PHONE ON A PAD AND VOILA! CHARGING IS ON! THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE PHONE THAT YOU CAN EVEN GIFT YOURSELF WITH WHENEVER YOU SAVE FROM YOUR POCKET MONEY OVER A PERIOD OF TIME!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"MY VIEWS ON THE LUMIA 920 AFTER USING IT FOR A WEEK. I SHIFTED TO LUMIA 920 AFTER BEING AN IPHONE USER FOR MORE THAN 3 YEARS. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR SHIFTING WAS WINDOWS 8 AND WINDOWS PHONE 8. I AM ENJOYING BOTH ON THE DESKTOP AND NOW ON THE NEW LUMIA PHONE. THE PEOPLE HUB IS FANTASTIC WITH THE COOL INTEGRATION WITH FACEBOOK ETC ? ALL IN ONE PLACE.
      
      WEIGHT IS NOT AN ISSUE AT ALL ? FELT RELATIVELY HEAVY WHEN I HELD IT FIRST. BUT IT IS JUST THE FIRST REACTION. YOU DON?T EVEN NOTICE THE WEIGHT NOW. SO MANY HAVE TALKED ALREADY IN DETAIL ABOUT THE PLUS AND MINUS POINTS OF THE PHONE. SO NOTHING MUCH TO ADD THERE. BUT I NEED TO TELL A FEW POINTS ABOUT THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      THERE WAS RANDOM REBOOTING'S WHILE ON CALL. INITIAL CALL TO NOKIA SUPPORT ENDED WITH THEM ASKING ME TO DO A HARD RESET. BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED AND THE SECOND CALL ENDED WITH ME GOING TO NOKIA CARE WHO UPDATED THE FIRMWARE/ SOFTWARE AND FROM THEN ON, THERE ARE NO ISSUES;
      
      
      BEFORE DOING THE HARD RESETS, I HAD TAKEN THE BACKUP AND IF WE NEED TO RESTORE THIS BACKUP, WE NEED TO NECESSARILY SIGN INTO THE WINDOWS ID, WHEN THE PHONE RESTARTS. IF WE DO NOT, WE WILL NOT GET THE OPTION TO RESTORE IT LATER;
      
      HAVING COME FROM IPHONE, I FIND THE SELECTION OF WORDS OR PART THEREOFF USING THE FINGERS A BIT DIFFICULT;
      
      
      WANT OF APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SAID A LOT. ALTHOUGH I COULD FIND REPLACEMENTS FOR MOST OF THE IPHONE APPLICATIONS WHICH I WAS USING, CERTAIN APPLICATIONS FOR HOME BUDGETING, USE OF ACCESS DATABASE ETC WERE FOUND TO BE INADEQUATE OR WERE NOT AVAILABLE. I AM SURE MORE APPLICATIONS WILL COME SOON.
      
      
      HOWEVER, OVERALL I REALLY ENJOY THE PHONE AND THE FANTASTIC OS. IT WAS DEFINITELY A WORTHWHILE SHIFT FROM IOS.
      
      
      FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS EXCELLENT."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"NICE PHONE WITH VERY GOOD BUILD QUALITY, AND TERRIFIC SCREEN CLARITY, USER FRIENDLY, ALL AROUND I HAVE GIVEN 5 STAR RATING FOR THIS PHONE. HD LCD SCREEN HAS SUPURB CLARITY. YES I RECOMEND THIS PHONE. JUST YOU USE IT ONE HOUR AND YOU WONT LIKE ANY OTHER PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"NOKIA BEING ON ITS LAST LEGS HAS DECIDED TO GO ALL OUT ON THEIR LUMIA SERIES WITH THE HOPE OF CAPTURING THE EARLY GLORIES OF ITS HEY DAY. GUESS WHAT, IT SHOWS THROUGH ON THEIR PHONES, BE IT ERGONOMICS, DESIGN, STYLE OR APPLICATION.
      
      
      WHEN YOU SWITCH ON THE PHONE, THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKES YOU IS THE INNOVATIVE AND BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED TILES THAT SETS IT APART FROM ANY OF ITS COMPETITORS. COMBINE THAT ALONG WITH THE OPTION OF CHANGING THE TILE COLORS, SIZE AND LOOK, YOU'VE GOT THE FREEDOM OF CUSTOMIZING TO SUIT YOUR NEEDS. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE RESOLUTION. IT EASILY IS ABOVE THE IPHONE 5 OR SAMSUNG S3. THE TILES ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND WHEN YOU PLAY A TRACK ON THE PHONE, THE MUSIC TILE SCROLLS THE NAME OF THE SONG AND THE ARTIST. CERTAIN APPS LIKE DICTIONARY (FREE) KEEPS CHANGING AND THE LAST VIEWED WORD IS CONSTANTLY ON THE TILE. THIS HELPS BELIEVE IN LEARNING ONE WORD A DAY. SMALL CHANGES LIKE THESE MAKE THIS A VERY PRACTICAL PHONE.
      
      
      THE PHONE IS ALSO EXTREMELY USER FRIENDLY AND OFFERS MANY SMALL BUT INNOVATIVE CHANGES THAT MAKE THE PHONE SUCH A JOY TO USE. ALMOST ANYTHING (CONTACTS, VIDEOS, PHOTOS, APPS, INDIVIDUAL TRACKS ETC) CAN BE ""PINNED"" TO THE MAIN SCREEN FOR EASY ACCESS. THIS HAS MADE MY LIFE A LOT EASIER AND CAN HELP IN QUICKLY ACCESSING THINGS THAT I OFTEN USE. THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS PHONE IS ITS MULTI TASKING ABILITY. I HAVE OFTEN OPENED 5 OR 6 DIFFERENT WINDOWS (APPLICATION, CONTACTS, MUSIC, MESSAGING) AT THE SAME TIME AND HOLDING THE BACK BUTTON FOR A SECOND SHRINKS ALL THE WINDOWS ""MAC STYLE"" AND THE DESIRED WINDOW CAN IMMEDIATELY BE ACCESSED WITHOUT LOSING THE CURRENT WINDOW. EVEN WHEN MULTIPLE WINDOWS ARE OPENED (5 -6), THE PHONE NEVER SLOWS DOWN.
      
      
      THE NOKIA APP STORE, THOUGH NOT AS DIVERSE AND LOADED LIKE THE APPLE STORE, STILL PROVIDES A LOT OF USEFUL APPLICATIONS. NOKIA MAPS PROVIDES THE OPTION OF DOWNLOADING A MAP OF ANY COUNTRY AND CAN BE ACCESSED OFFLINE. THIS IS SUCH A BLESSING WHEN I NEED DIRECTIONS AND DON'T HAVE GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION. NOKIA MUSIC PROVIDES 1 YEAR OF UNLIMITED SUBSCRIPTION AND CAN BE USED TO DOWNLOAD ALBUMS FREE OF COST.
      
      
      AS FAR AS PRACTICALITY GOES, THIS PHONE IS RIGHT THERE AT THE TOP. I HAVE USED IOS FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS AND I FOUND THE TRANSITION FROM APPLE TO NOKIA SEAMLESS. THE CONTACT LIST IS ALPHABETICALLY ARRANGED AND THE TILE CAN BE CLICKED ON TO BRING ABOUT THE ENTIRE ALPHABET LIST TO QUICKLY NAVIGATE TO THE DESIRED CONTACT. WHILE THE IPHONE HAS THE CLOSELY PACKED SIDE BARS WHICH QUITE OFTEN MISSES THE CORRECT INPUT AND TAKES ME EITHER TO THE PRECEDING OR THE SUCCEEDING ALPHABET.
      
      
      THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF A CONTACT CAN BE ACCESSED EITHER THROUGH THE CALLS LIST OR THE CONTACT LIST (SWIPING EITHER SIDE WILL LEAD TO THE ENTIRE MESSAGE THREAD, PHOTO ALBUM, FACEBOOK, MAIL ETC OF THE CONTACT). SUCH SMALL CHANGES MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE WHEN USING THE PHONE. THE ONLY GRIPE I HAVE WITH THIS PHONE IS THE ABSENCE OF CUSTOMIZED LABELS WHICH IOS PROVIDES. YOU ARE PRESENTED ONLY WITH GENERIC CONTACTS TITLES (HOME 1, OFFICE 1 ETC) WHICH LEADS TO CONFUSION ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS WHO USE 2 OR 3 PHONES.
      
      
      THE CAMERA IS ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES OF THE PHONE AND HAS ONE OF THE BEST LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE OF ANY PHONE ON THE MARKET TODAY. BEING A PHOTOGRAPHER, I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT THIS PHONE IS A SOLIDWHEN IT COMES TO CAPTURING PHOTOS WITH VERY LITTLE LIGHT AND ITS LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE IS VERY WELL AHEAD OF ANY PHONE. FOR THE GEEKS, THE CAMERA GOES UPTO ISO 800.
      
      
      THERE IS SO MUCH TO BE SAID ABOUT THIS PHONE BUT I THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THE JOY OF DISCOVERY. I AM NOT A NOKIA FANBOY (THE LAST NOKIA PHONE I HAD WAS THE 7610 WAY BACK IN 2006). I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR QUITE SOMETIME TO BUY THIS PHONE SINCE IT WAS INTRODUCED AND I AM GLAD. THE PHONE HAS EXCEEDED MY BEST EXPECTATIONS.
      
      
      PRO'S:
      
      EXCELLENT ERGONOMICS
      
      BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED
      
      THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS SIMPLY AMAZING
      
      HUGELY CUSTOMIZABLE
      
      PRACTICAL
      
      VERY GOOD CAMERA
      
      SMALL INNOVATIVE TWEAKS THAT GO A LONG WAY
      
      
      CONS:
      
      NO CUSTOMIZABLE CONTACT LABEL
      
      32GB WITH NO EXTERNAL MEMORY SLOT
      
      SLIGHTLY BIG (BUT YOU'LL GET OVER IT SOON ONCE YOU SEE ITS RESOLUTION AND THE QUALITY)
      
      LIMITED APP STORE
      
      
      FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE SAVING UP FOR A SMART PHONE, GO AHEAD AND BUY THIS PHONE WITHOUT A THOUGHT, YOU'LL LOVE IT. EVERYONE (FRIENDS, FAMILY) WHO'VE SEEN THIS PHONE HAVE FALLEN INSTANTLY IN LOVE WITH ITS ALLURING BEAUTY AND ONCE I'VE GIVEN THEM A TASTE OF WHAT THIS PHONE CAN DO, THEY ARE HOOKED. THESE ARE GUYS WHO USED IPHONE'S AND SAMSUNG FOR YEARS. NOKIA IS BACK WITH THE SAME INNOVATIVE MINDSET THAT HELPED THEM ESTABLISH A MONOPOLY ON THE MOBILE MARKET IN INDIA OVER A DECADE AGO.
      
      
      I VERY RARELY POST REVIEWS OF PRODUCTS I HAVE PURCHASED AND I DECIDED TO POST THIS BECAUSE I AM BIT PARTIAL TO NOKIA (MY FIRST PHONE WAS A NOKIA) AND HOPE THIS REVIEW CONVINCES SOMEONE TO BUY THIS BRILLIANT PHONE THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE BURIED UNDER THE OVER SATURATED, BIG BRAND NAME MARKET OF THE SMART PHONE"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"NOKIA IS SERIOUSLY BACK WITH A BANG! AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND A FEW EXTRA BUCK THEN THIS IS THE BEST PHONE IN THE MARKET NOW!
      
      LUMIA IS THE ONLY SERIES WHICH COULD PULL OFF SUCH BOLD COLORS.
      
      IF YOU ARE AN ANDROID USER IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME TO GETTING USED TO IT BUT IN THE END ITS JUST AWESOME!
      
      
      CONS :
      
      DURING WIRELESS CHARGING THE PHONE GETS REALLY HOT.
      
      NO PROPER FILE MANAGER.
      
      
      REST ASSURED, IT IS ACTUALLY WORTH IT."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"NOKIA LUMIA 920 IS THE MOST INNOVATIVE LUMIA OF ALL THE 5 LUMIAS OF THE CURRENT WINDOWS PHONE 8 FAMILY.
      
      HERE'S WHAT I LIKE THE MOST IN IT:-
      
      *BETTER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS EVEN IN LOW LIGHT AND NIGHT DUE TO PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY WITH OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION AND A CARL ZEISS OPTICS.
      
      *LUMIA 920 COMES WITH FULL VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE AND OUTLOOK. CREATE AND EDIT POWERPOINT, EXCEL AND WORD DOCUMENTS WITH EASE WHEREVER YOU ARE. THOUGH OFFICE IS IN OTHER LUMIAS ALSO, BUT IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THIS GREAT FEATURE!
      
      *WITH NOKIA MUSIC YOU CAN STREAM UNLIMITED MUSIC FOR FREE.
      
      *NOKIA LUMIA 920 ALSO SUPPORTS WIRELESS CHARGING.
      
      *THE SUPER-SENSITIVE SCREEN IS EASY TO TOUCH ON AND THE LATEST WINDOWS PHONE 8 OS SHINES ON THIS BEAUTIFUL LUMIA!
      
      *WITH 1 GB OF RAM, ALMOST ALL APPS ON THE WINDOWS PHONE STORE WILL BE ABLE TO RUN SEAMLESSLY ON NOKIA LUMIA 920 PLUS THE EXCLUSIVES FROM NOKIA!
      
      AT THE END, I WOULD SAY THAT THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 IS MEANT FOR TECHNOLOGY ADDICTS, EARLY-ADOPTERS AND IMAGING ENTHUSIASTS WHO NEED TO HAVE THE BIGGEST AND THE BEST."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"NOT EXACTLY PROS AND CONS BUT THINGS WORTH LOOKING AT LUMIA 920 ARE:
      
      STRONG BODY, CAMERA, BEST PERFORMANCE IN TOUCH AND PROCESSING, OFFLINE MAPS, CLEAN INTERFACES, KIDS CORNER/GUEST ACCOUNT, GREAT SOCIAL NETWORK INTEGRATION. APPS ARE GOOD ENOUGH UNLESS YOU WANT THE EXACT SAME APPS ON OTHER PLATFORMS. NOKIA MUSIC IS GOOD. DOLBY AUDIO IS GREAT ON GOOD HEADPHONES. (THE DEFAULT HEADSET GIVEN WITH PHONE IS THE WORST AUDIO DEVICE I'VE SEEN SO FAR IN MY LIFE)
      
      
      NEEDS IMPROVEMENT IN: THE USER INTERFACE THOUGH ELEGANTLY SIMPLE STILL HAS REDUNDANT SWIPES REQUIRED FOR MUNDANE TASKS.  (E.G CONNECTIVITY SETTINGS/VIEWING NEW NOTIFICATION/ CHANGING AUDIO TRACK OR CHOOSING ALBUMS/ ORGANIZING VIDEOS)
      
      MAPS DON'T HAVE 'FIND DESTINATION VIA'/ADD DESTINATION OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO VISIT MULTIPLE PLACES.
      
      THERE ARE FEW MORE SUCH EXAMPLES WHICH CAN ENHANCE THE USER EXPERIENCE THROUGH A SOFTWARE UPDATE BUT WONDER HOW WOULD THESE(AND MORE) REACTIONS REACH THEM!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"PROS:
      
      1. SMOOTH OS. FLUID UI.
      
      2. DISPLAY IS 720P AND 330PPI+ WHICH IS WONDERFUL TO LOOK AT. THE BLACKS OUT DEEP AND DARK.
      
      3. NOKIA PHONES ARE ALWAYS BUILT TO LAST. FIT AND FINISH IS AWESOME. ITS BUILT LIKE A TANK.
      
      4. THE FINISH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SCRATCH AND THE COLOURS ARE INHERENT.
      
      5. YOU GET MS OFFICE FREE
      
      6. NOKIA DRIVE NOKIA MAPS ARE AVAILABLE OFFLINE WHICH IS A BIG BONUS.
      
      7. NOKIA MUSIC IS ALSO GREAT AND HAS A MASSIVE LIBRARY.
      
      8. 1GB RAM IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO RUN ALL GAMES. XBOX GAMES ARE IMPRESSIVE
      
      9. LESS MALWARE APPS ON WINDOWS PHONE UNLIKE ANDROID WHERE IT IS EASY TO COMPROMISE THE SAFETY OF YOUR DEVICE WITH MALWARE
      
      10. ALL ESSENTIAL APPS ARE AVAILABLE ON WINDOWS PHONE LIKE WEATHER, ESPN, FOX, BBC, SPORTS, BUSINESS, NEWS, MOVIES. ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF APPS IS LESS THAN ANDROID YOU WONT FEEL THE STORE LACKING.
      
      (ANDROID HAS MULTIPLE APPS FPR THE SAME CATEGORY LIKE SAY FOR WEATHER IT HAS DOZENS OF THEM WHILE WINDOWS HAS ONLY A FEW. NEVERTHELESS YOU WILL GET THE MOST ACCURATE WEATHER ON WINDOWS AS PROMINENT WEATHER WEBSITES HAVE APPS. THE NUMBER OF APPS DOESN'T CORRESPOND TO THE STORE BEING BETTER. REMEMBER QUALITY IS MORE ESSENTIAL THAN QUANTITY.)
      
      
      11. THE OS DOES NOT LAG.
      
      12. THE PUREVIEW CAMERA IS AWESOME AND SHOOTS WONDERFUL PICTURES AND VIDEOS
      
      13. WIRELESS CHARGING CAPABILITIES.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. SOME MIGHT NOT LIKE THE WEIGHT OF THE DEVICE BUT THATS A PERSONAL CHOICE. PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT SAMSUNG'S BUILD BEING PLASTICKY AND SO ON.
      
      2. THE DIMENSIONS MIGHT BE THICKER THAN OTHER DEVICES BUT AGAIN THATS A PERSONAL CHOICE (SLIMMER LUMIA 925 COMING SHORTLY TO RECTIFY THAT)
      
      3. MICROSOFT NEEDS TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE OS. UPDATES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. Q4 UPDATE EXPECTED TO BRING NOTIFICATION CENTRE ETC.
      
      4. CLOSING APPS REQUIRES YOU TO SELECT AN OPEN APP AND PRESS BACK TO CLOSE. MIGHT BE IRRITATING IN IE WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO THE FIRST PAGE TO CLOSE.
      
      
      VERDICT:
      
      A VERY GOOD COMEBACK SMARTPHONE. THE OS MAY NOT BE AS ADVANCED AS IOS BUT WITH A FEW QUIRKS AND TRICKS THE PHONE WILL WORK SUPERBLY.
      
      LIKE FOR INSTANCE INSTALLING A FASTER BROWSER. NOT ALL VIDEOS/MUSIC FORMATS ARE SUPPORTED BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS USE YOUR PC TO GET THE REQUIRED FORMAT. PLUS NOKIA MUSIC ISN'T LACKING AT ALL.
      
      I SUGGEST GETTING YOUR OWN EARPHONES TOO. THE PHONE WILL ALMOST NEVER HANG BUT IF IT DOES THEN YOU CAN'T REMOVE THE BATTERY AND YOU MIGHT BE STUCK FOR A FEW MINUTES. OR IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY EVEN MORE TIME. BUT AS THESE THINGS RARELY HAPPEN THIS ISN'T A REASON TO ABANDON THE DEVICE.
      
      SO SHOULD YOU GET THIS DEVICE?
      
      AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS RETAILS FOR AROUND THE 30K MARK WHICH PROVIDES GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY AND ALL THE TOPEND FEATURES TOO. FOR THE PRICE IT IS DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED.
      
      GO FOR IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"PURCHASED THIS PHONE ON 9TH JUNE ..AND I HAVE ONE WORD TO SAY AMAZING...SO ANYONE CONFUSED BETWEEN ANDROID, IOS OR MICROSOFT PHONES..GO FOR LUMIA 920 WITHOUT ANY HESITATION..GOT EVERYTHING..
      
      GAMES-XBOX
      
      CAMERA-NO COMPARISON..SUPERB
      
      CALL QUALITY- WONDERFULL
      
      APPS- U CAN'T GET MUCH BETTER APPS THEN MICROSOFT
      
      BUT THERE IS ONE NEGATIVE POINT IT HEATS WHILE PLAYING GAMES ..BUT THATS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME AS THIS IS PHONE NOT OUR LAPTOP WHICH HAVE SMALL FANS TO COOL THE PROCESSOR..MAY BE FUTURE PHONES WILL GOING TO HAVE IT..BUT NOW ALL THE SMART PHONES ARE FACING THIS HEATING PROBLEM..
      
      
      AT LAST I WOULD SAY IF U NEED A PHONE WHICH CAN BEHAVE LIKE A BUSSINESS PHONE, LIKE UR PSP FOR GAMING , LIKE A HIGH END DIGI CAM ..AND GIVES U A FLAWLESS EXPERIENCE ALL OVER THEN GO FOR IT."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"PURE VIEW TECHNOLOGY IS GREAT AND ONLY AVAILABLE TO NOKIA.
      
      THUS CAN TAKE LOW LIGHT IMAGE PERFECTLY AND BETTER THEN ANY OTHER MOBILE CAMERA CHECK ON GSM ARENA. 	HYBRID (NT KERNEL) WHICH MAKE IT AS GOOD AS REAL WINDOWS OS."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"RATING 4.5/5
      
      
      USP?
      
      REDEFINING CALL TO ACTION. SWITCHED FROM BUTTONS TO TEXT. NO BUTTONS ONLY TEXT. BEAUTIFUL FLUID COLORFUL TEXT . VERY VERY SIMPLE.
      
      
      WHY I BOUGHT IT?
      
      SINCE THE FIRST DAY, I SAW IT'S ADVERTISEMENT IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO ME, THAT I CAN BE RATIONAL ENOUGH NOT GO WITH OLD MONOTONIC UI OF IOS OR ANDROID AND COULD ACTUALLY GO WITH THE UNDERDOG IN THE MARKET WHICH WAS WINDOWS OS. AS FAR AS APPS ARE CONCERNED, IN THE END OF THIS REVIEW YOU COULD FIND A LIST OF APPS THAT I USE AND THEN NOBODY HAS TO SAY THAT WINDOWS PLATFORM DOESN'T HAVE APPS. YES THERE ARE PLENTY OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE APPS ALONG WITH OLD IOS AND ANDROID APPS. AGREED THAT THAT IT WOULD TAKE TIME FOR DEVELOPERS TO CHOOSE WINDOWS AS FIRST CHOICE FOR RELEASING THEIR APP.
      
      
      HOW LONG SINCE I AM USING IT?
      
      IT'S BEEN AROUND 15 DAYS AS OF TODAY SINCE I HAVE BOUGHT IT AND ALL MY EXPERIENCE IS BASED ON MY INTERACTION WITHIN THESE 15 DAYS.
      
      
      WHAT IS REALLY REALLY GOOD, 5 STAR TYPES?
      
      SCREEN | CAMERA | INTERACTION | ALL NOKIA APPS ( MAPS, DRIVE, TRAILERS, MUSIC*) | BATTERY BACKUP | RESPONSIVENESS | SCREENSHOTS(VERY USEFULL) | GAMES | MEMORY(32 GB)
      
      NOKIA MUSIC IS THE AWESOMEST OF ALL OF 'EM.
      
      NEVER WORRY ABOUT SPACE.
      
      
      SOME NOT SO GOOD THINGS
      
      WEIGHT (COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LIGHTER)
      
      
      BRACE YOURSELF, APPS ARE COMING....
      
      
      FIRST SOME NOKIA APPS -  CITY LENS, DRIVE, MAPS, MUSIC, TRAILERS, TRANSPORT. ALL ARE EXCELLENT.
      
      OTHERS WALKEE TEXTEE*, SKYSCANNER, SHAZAM, EVERNOTE, RUBBERNECK*, PHOTOFUNIA, MOQUU,INSTANT HEART RATE*, HIKE, DIDLER, DAY COUNTER, CIFRA CLUB TUNER*, ZOMATO, CLEARTRIP,  WHATSAPP, TWITTER, FACEBOOK, TUBEBOX(YOUTUBE APP), TALK.TO, SKINERY, KINDLE E-BOOK READER
      
      
      *MARKED ARE SOME NEW INNOVATIVE APPS
      
      
      BRACE YOUR SELF GAMES ARE COMING....

      TO GET THESE APPS YOU COULD USE, APPDEALS OR BROWSE USING, APPFLOW.
      
      
      IN ALL, IT IS A VERY GOOD PHONE TO BUY IF YOU COULD JUSTIFY THE MONEY YOU RE SPENDING :)
      
      
      EDIT: 1 MONTH AND STILL LOVING IT !"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"SINCE I WAS PRETTY YOUNG, I HAVEN?T HAD MANY FRIENDS. I GUESS I WAS JUST TERRIFIED TO WALK UP TO SOMEONE AND SAY HELLO. BUT AS I STARTED GROWING UP, THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE AND THE NEW EXCITING WORLD OF THE INTERNET EMERGED, I FOUND MAKING ONLINE FRIENDS EASY AND LESS THREATENING. I LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN BE FRIENDS WITH A TOTAL STRANGER WHOM I HAVEN?T MET PERSONALLY. MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 HELPS ME MAKE NUMEROUS ONLINE FRIENDS WITH ITS WI-FI AND SOCIAL NETWORKING CAPABILITIES. THE WINDOWS 8 MAKES MY ACCESS TO THE FREQUENTLY USED APPS FASTER THROUGH THE ME TILES FUNCTION AND I CAN VISIT FACEBOOK, YAHOO MAIL, PEOPLEHUB, GMAIL ALL AT ONCE AND CHAT WITH 2-3 FRIENDS SIMULTANEOUSLY. BLUETOOTH HELPS ME SHARE VIDEOS AND MUSIC TRACKS IN NO TIME.
      
      
      MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 ALSO HAS BUSINESS APPS LIKE ADOBE ACROBAT READER, WORD, EXCEL AND POWERPOINT IN IT. THE 32 GB ONBOARD MEMORY CAPACITY AND SKYDRIVE FREE CLOUD STORAGE OF 7 GB IS SUFFICIENT TO STORE MY SNAPS, SONGS AND DATA. I LOVE TO MAKE ONLINE FRIENDS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DATING, I PREFER GIRLS WHOM I KNOW PERSONALLY, ON A ONE-ON-ONE BASIS. WHEN OUT ON A DATE, MY SMART PHONE?S HERE CITY LENS, HERE MAPS, HERE DRIVE AND HERE TRANSIT FUNCTIONS COME IN HANDY, AS THEY DISPLAY ALL THE NEARBY EATERIES, DISCOS, SOCIAL CLUBS AND MOVIE THEATRES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE CITY. THIS WAY, I?M FREE OF THE HASSLE OF FINDING OUT NEW PLACES AND MY DATE IS QUITE IMPRESSED BY MY KNOWLEDGE OF NEW DESTINATIONS.
      
      
      I LOVE TO CLICK PICTURES WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND WITH MY NOKIA LUMIA?S 8.7 MP CAMERA, FEATURING THE CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS, PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION, THE SNAPS COME OUT NATURAL AND BEAUTIFUL. THE PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY 4.5 INCH TOUCHSCREEN IS SO DELICATE THAT I CAN BROWSE IT EVEN IF I?M WEARING GLOVES. IT HAS A SHARPER, CLEARER SCREEN WHICH MAKES BROWSING, CHATTING AND PLAYING ONLINE GAMES FASTER. DONNED WITH CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2, IT?S HIGHLY RESISTANT TO FINGERPRINTS, SCRATCHES AND DAMAGES DUE TO ACCIDENTAL BUMPS OR FALLS. I?M PASSIONATE ABOUT MUSIC AND MY PHONE?S NOKIA MUSIC GIVES ME THE BEST AND LATEST POPULAR MUSIC TRACKS AVAILABLE. I CAN MAKE MY OWN PERSONAL COLLECTION OF MY FAVOURITE NUMBERS TOO.
      
      
      ONE MORE FEATURE THAT FASCINATES ME ABOUT MY PHONE IS THAT IT CAN BE CHARGED WIRELESSLY. I JUST HAVE TO PLACE MY PHONE ON THE WIRELESS CHARGING PAD AND IT AUTOMATICALLY GETS CHARGED. ITS UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN EXUDES CLASS AND ELEGANCE, WHILE MAKING SURE IT?S DURABLE TOO. THE 10.8 HOURS 3G TALK-TIME AND 460 HOURS 3G BATTERY STANDBY TIME LETS ME TALK TO MY FRIENDS AS MUCH AS I WANT TO. I WAS EXCITED WHEN I HEARD THAT NOKIA LUMIA 920 WON THE READER?S CHOICE SMARTPHONE OF THE YEAR IN THE ENGADGET AWARDS 2012. I MUST SAY, THE GUYS THERE SURELY KNOW WHAT THE BEST IN TECHNOLOGY IS! IF I WAS GIVEN A CHOICE, I WOULD HAVE ALSO CHOSEN NOKIA LUMIA 920 AS THE BEST SMARTPHONE."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"SINCE THE DAY I HAVE GOT THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 I HAVE BEEN ADDICTED TO IT. THERE ISN?T A MOMENT I CAN SPEND WITHOUT MY PHONE BECAUSE IT IS JUST SO AWESOME. WHATEVER I DO, MY PHONE TOTALLY SUPPORTS ME. THEY SAY THERE IS NO FRIEND AS LOYAL AS A BOOK; I SAY THERE IS NO FRIEND AS LOYAL AS THE NOKIA LUMIA 920. WITH THE LIVE TILES AND PEOPLE HUB FEATURES, I CAN KEEP UPDATING MY FACEBOOK PROFILE. ALL MY FRIENDS ARE IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH ME AND I SIMPLY NEVER FEEL LONELY. MY FAVOURITE APPS ARE RIGHT ON MY HOME SCREEN AND I CAN USE THEM WHENEVER I WANT. NOT JUST THAT, MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 WORKS CONSISTENTLY ALL DAY WITHOUT INTERRUPTION THANKS TO A DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM.
      
      
      MY NOKIA LUMIA 920?S UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN GIVES THE PHONE A SLEEK AND SEXY LOOK ALONG WITH DURABILITY. THE BIGGEST ADDICTION OF THE PHONE IS DUE TO ITS AMAZING 8.7 MP CAMERA THAT COMES WITH A STATE-OF-THE-ART CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS. THE PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY GIVES MY SNAPS EXCELLENT CLARITY AND THE OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION FEATURE ELIMINATES BLURRING. UNLIKE OTHER PHONES, MY PHONE?S CAMERA IS USEFUL EVEN AT NIGHT. THE DUAL LED FLASH HELPS ME CLICK BEAUTIFUL PICTURES WITH AMAZING QUALITY. I JUST CAN?T TAKE MY EYES OFF THE LUMIA 920?S 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY THAT IS INTEGRATED WITH PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY AND COVERED BY CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2. MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 HAS THE BEST DISPLAY AND ALLOWS ME TO VIEW AND EDIT MS OFFICE AND PDF FILES.
      
      
      ALL CREDIT GOES TO THE SUPER-SENSITIVE SCREEN THAT ENABLES ME TO FLIP THROUGH PAGES AT A SOFT TOUCH! ANOTHER REASON WHY I?M ADDICTED TO MY NEW PHONE IS THE NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE FEATURES. I?M A VERY ADVENTUROUS, OUTDOORSY PERSON WHO LOVES TO GO ON LONG CAMPS AND DRIVES. THE NOKIA LUMIA 920?S FEATURES OFFER TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATION THAT LETS ME TRAVEL CAREFREE! I CAN HAVE FUN AND FORGET WORRYING ABOUT THE ROADS. ALL THIS TRAVELLING CAN BE DONE WHILE I LISTEN TO MY FAVOURITE SONGS VIA NOKIA MUSIC AND NOKIA RADIO MIX. 32 GB ON-BOARD STORAGE IS ENOUGH FOR MY FAVOURITE SONGS AND VIDEOS.
      
      
      MY NOKIA LUMIA IS EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE LATEST DATA-TRANSFER FEATURES. I DO NOT NEED MY LAPTOP ANYMORE THANKS TO MY NEW PHONE. THE NFC IS THE NEW RAGE ALONG WITH WI-FI, WLAN AND BLUETOOTH THAT ARE ALSO SUPPORTED BY MY PHONE. I CAN TRANSFER DATA WITH SUCH EASE NOW AND EVEN DOWNLOAD STUFF FROM THE INTERNET ON MY PHONE WITH SUPPORT FOR 3G AND LTE SERVICES. WHAT?S MORE, WITH WIRELESS CHARGING MADE POSSIBLE, I DO NOT HAVE TO WASTE TIME UNTANGLING A MESS. ALL I NEED TO DO IS LAY THE PHONE DOWN ON ITS CHARGING BASE AND LET IT CHARGE. THE BATTERY DOES NOT DRAIN OUT FASTER EVEN WHEN THE PHONE SUPPORTS SO MANY APPS!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"STRAIGHT TO THE POINT, LUMIA 920 + WINDOWS8 PROVIDES THE PREMIUM FEEL OF APPLE PRODUCTS WITH THE PROFESSIONALISM OF BLACKBERRY. I WAS A ANDROID USER FOR PAST 3 YEARS &AMP; WAS VERY SKEPTIC ABOUT THE WINDOWS PHONE &AMP; ITS UI. HAVING USED ANDROID FOR SUCH A LONG PERIOD WITH MULTIPLE SCREENS &AMP; OPTIONS TO CUSTOMIZE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT WITH SHORTCUTS &AMP; WIDGETS; I WASN'T SURE IF I COULD ADAPT WITH JUST 2 FIXED SCREENS OF WIN8. SURPRISINGLY, I FOUND IT AMAZING HOW MUCH PRECISE THE TWO SCREENS COULD GET. HAVING THAT MANY SCREENS  &AMP; WIDGETS IN ANDROID ACTUALLY MAKES ME LESS PRODUCTIVE SWIPING AROUND SCREENS TO FIND WHAT I WANT :)
      
      
      UI:
      
      FLUID, RESPONSIVE, NO LAG WHATSOEVER. YOU FAVORITE APPS ARE LITERALLY JUST A CLICK AWAY.
      
      
      SOCIAL MEDIA:
      
      FB &AMP; TWITTER ARE VERY TIGHTLY INTEGRATED AND YOU WON'T FEEL THE NEED FOR ANY NATIVE APP FOR THEM. SOCIAL MEDIA INTEGRATION WITH THE CONTACTS IS SIMPLY SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER PHONE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET. BUT AS EXPECTED, GOOGLE IS YET OUT OF THE PLAY &AMP; I'M MISSING MY GOOGLE MESSENGER IN WP &AMP; THERE ARE NO SOLID APPS THAT ADDRESS THIS GAP.
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      CAMERA IS SIMPLY AMAZING, STANDS UP TO ALL THAT HYPE AROUND.
      
      
      FREE OF ZUNE:
      
      UNLIKE WP7 PHONES, WP8 DON'T REQUIRE ZUNE. THEY ARE PLUG &AMP; PLAY JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ANDROID PHONE. PLUG IN AND COPY THE MUSIC/VIDEO AS YOU WOULD DO WITH ANY OTHER SD CARD &AMP; THAT'S IT. WHICH MEANS WP PHONES ARE NOT TIED TO JUST WINDOWS, YOU CAN USE THEM AS FILE TRANSFER DEVICES IN OTHER OS PLATFORMS AS WELL
      
      
      BATTERY:
      
      HOWEVER, BATTERY LIFE IS ONE THE DOWNSIDE. I HARDLY MAKE IT TO END OF THE DAY WITH 3G ON ALL DAY LONG WITH MODERATE USAGE, BUT THAT'S QUITE REASONABLE FOR A SMARTPHONE THIS SIZE. IF YOU ARE NOT USING 3G, YOU CAN EASILY MAKE IT THROUGH A FULL DAY!
      
      
      HEATING:
      
      I FACE WITH A PROBLEM OF THE PHONE GETTING HOT WHEN CONNECTED TO A WIFI OR PLAYING ANY GAMES. AM I THE ONLY ONE ?
      
      
      SETTINGS:
      
      THERE ARE A FEW THING THAT MS MIGHT WANT TO ADDRESS WITH THE CUSTOMIZATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
      
      
      CRITICS:
      
      MOST OF THE CLAIMS FROM WP CRITICS IS THE LACK OF APP ENVIRONMENT, BUT TRUST ME, ITS REACHING THE POINT. YOU HAVE PLENTY OF QUALITY APPS TO CHOOSE FROM. IT MIGHT NOT BE UPTO THE LEVEL OF APPS ANDROID IS HAVING, BUT YES - EVENTUALLY IT WILL GET THERE.
      
      
      VERDICT:
      
      IGNORE THE CRITICS, JUST GO FOR IT - YOU WILL LOVE IT FOR THE SIMPLICITY &AMP; EASE OF USE. I DON'T REGRET MAKING THE SWITCH, INFACT I'M BOASTFUL ABOUT THE SWITCH."

      (2) HEATING UP OF BACK SIDE OF PHONE(ALTHOUGH THAT IT OCCURS VERY LESS)
      
      (3) SLIGHTLY HEAVY(NOT AT ALL HEAVY WHEN U USE IT FOR SEVERAL DAYS U WILL NT FOUND IT HEAVY)
      
      (4) SLOW SHUTTER SPEED OF CAMERA(ALTHOUGH ITS QUALITY IS BEST ON EARTH)"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"TAKE THE RISK OF GOING OUT OF WAY FROM BUYING AN IPHONE OR ANDROID AND YOU WILL BE SURPRISED. THE PROBLEMS OF LACK OF APPS AS COMPARED TO IOS OR ANDROID IS TRUE, BUT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER WITH TIME!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THANK YOU FLIPKART FOR THE YELLOW COLOUR AND THE AWESOME DELIVERY SERVICE THAT YOU HAVE. THE PHONE GOT DELIVERED TO ME IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS FROM THE TIME OF ORDER.
      
      
      FINALLY A FREAKING AWESOME PHONE BY NOKIA TO HAVE IN OUR HANDS !
      
      
      COMING TO THE PHONE, IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 10 DAYS I HAVE BEEN USING THE LUMIA 920 AND IT HASN'T DISAPPOINTED ME AT ALL. INFACT IT HAS GIVEN ME MORE REASONS TO SMILE WITH EACH PASSING DAY.
      
      
      IT'S THE FIRST WITH OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION, WIRELESS CHARGING, A TOUCHSCREEN THAT CAN BE USED WITH ANY GLOVES AND A DISPLAY WITH THE HIGHEST REFRESH RATE ON ANY PHONE TODAY.
      
      
      WINDOWS PHONE 8 RUNS BUTTER SMOOTH - NO SLOWDOWNS, NO HANGING AND SEAMLESS MULTITASKING. NOKIA'S PRELOADED APPS (NOKIA MAPS, DRIVE AND MUSIC) PROVIDE A RICH EXPERIENCE ON THE DEVICE. MAP CAN BE DOWNLOADED COMPLETELY AND CAN EVEN BE USED WITHOUT ANY DATA CONNECTION JUST BY HAVING THE LOCATION SERVICES ON. NOKIA NOW HAS A MUCH BETTER NAVIGATION APP IN THE FORM OF NOKIA DRIVE AND IT DOESN'T AT ALL.
      
      
      THE PHONE LASTS ABOUT A DAY ON A FULL CHARGE WITH DATA (3G) CONNECTION ALWAYS ON. I'M ALWAYS ON CALLS, WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK AND MESSAGING AND THE BATTERY ISN'T DRAINED OUT COMPLETELY AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT STILL HAD LIFE TO KEEP GOING.
      
      
      GET THIS PHONE IF YOU HAVE BEEN THINKING OF SOMETHING NEW TO SWITCH AND IT WON'T DISAPPOINT YOU AT ALL. ITS A BOX FULL OF SURPRISES !

Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THE KILLER PHONE TILL NOW. BUT I AM WAITING FOR AWESOME 925 TO ARRIVE. HOPE IT WILL BE PRICED CLOSE TO 35K AND NOT MORE THAN THAT.
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING N86 SINCE LAST 6 YEARS AND WAS WAITING FOR THE NEXT KILLER. AND HERE IT ARRIVED!!!!
      
      LUMIA 925. IF ANY BODY IS PLANNING TO BUY 920, YOU MAY WAIT FOR ANOTHER MONTH TILL THE ARRIVAL OF 925. HOWEVER THERE WILL BE PRICE DIFFERENCE OF AROUND 4-6K BETWEEN 920 &AMP; 925. AGAIN THE 925 DESERVES THOSE EXTRA BUCKS!!!!!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THE LATEST PHONE I HAVE BOUGHT FOR MYSELF IS THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 AS I NEEDED A BREAK FROM THE MONOTONOUS ANDROID AND WANTED TO TRY WINDOWS PHONE OS. THE PHONE HAS COME AS A BREEZE OF REJUVENATING AIR AND INSTILLED GREAT INTEREST AND EXCITEMENT IN ME. FIRST OF ALL, MY PHONE HAS A STURDY AND SLEEK POLYCARBONATE DESIGN THAT FITS COMFORTABLY IN MY HAND. IT COMES IN ATTRACTIVE SNAP-ON COVERS OF CYAN, RED, YELLOW, BLACK AND WHITE COLOURS THAT EFFORTLESSLY DISPLAY MY STYLE AND ATTITUDE. I HAVE TAKEN A LIKING FOR THE TILED INTERFACE THAT THE OS BRINGS TO THE TABLE.
      
      ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I?VE NOTICED IN THE PHONE IS ITS DISPLAY AND TO SUM IT UP IN ONE WORD: GORGEOUS. MY LUMIA 920 SPORTS A 4.5-INCH IPS LCD CAPACITIVE TOUCHSCREEN WITH A RESOLUTION OF 1280 X 768 PIXELS WHICH PROVIDES SUPERIOR VIEWING ANGLES AND COLOUR RENDITION. THE PHONE ALSO FLAUNTS NOKIA?S CLEARBLACK TECHNOLOGY THAT PROVIDES ME ENHANCED CONTRAST AND LEGIBILITY EVEN IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT. THE SCREEN ALSO SPORTS PUREMOTION HD+ WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF HD DISPLAY, SUPER-SENSITIVE SCREEN AND A SUPER-FAST 60 HZ DISPLAY. THE 8.7 MP PUREVIEW CAMERA TAKES BLUR-FREE PICTURES EVEN IN LOW-LIGHT CONDITIONS AS OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION (OIS) COMPENSATES FOR THE SHAKING OF HANDS AND PROVIDES LONGER EXPOSURES. I HAVE NOW FOUND A PERMANENT REPLACEMENT TO MY DIGITAL CAMERA. SPEAKING OF VIDEO RECORDING, THE PHONE HAS KEPT ME IN AWE ALWAYS AS IT CAN SHOOT VIDEOS IN BOTH 720P AND 1080P. WITH OIS SENSOR CAPABILITY, IT GREATLY REDUCES THE SHAKINESS THAT IS VISIBLE IN SMARTPHONES THESE DAYS.
      
      
      NOKIA HAS BEEN WORKING REAL HARD ON ITS APP STORE AND HAS COME UP WITH SOME INTERESTING ONES OVER TIME. PEOPLEHUB GOES BEYOND AN ORDINARY ADDRESS BOOK AS IT IS A ONE-STOP SHOP THAT KEEPS ME UP TO DATE WITH MY SOCIAL NETWORKS AND CONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE I CARE MOST ABOUT. MS OFFICE OFTEN ACTS AS MY OFFICE ON THE GO AS I CAN VIEW AND EDIT IMPORTANT WORD AND EXCEL FILES ON THE GO. NOKIA DRIVE GIVES ME TURN BY TURN VOICE GUIDED NAVIGATION FOR EFFORTLESS DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND THAT TOO WITHOUT ANY DATA USAGE. NOW THAT TAKES THE CAKE AS WELL AS THE CHERRY ON TOP FOR ME. OTHER COOL APPS TO LOOK FOR ARE NOKIA MUSIC, NOKIA HERE, CITY LENS AND CINEMAGRAPH AMONG MANY OTHER.
      
      
      MY LUMIA 920 IS POWERED BY A 1.5 GHZ DUAL-CORE SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR, 1 GB OF RAM AND AN ADRENO 225 GPU THAT LET ME PLAY GRAPHICS INTENSIVE GAMES, WATCH HD VIDEOS IN CONJUNCTION WITH CHATTING ALL AT AN UNPARALLELED LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OF GLITCH. THE PHONE COMES WITH 32 GB OF ONBOARD MEMORY SUFFICIENT TO SAVE MY SONGS, GAMES, APPS AND MULTIMEDIA WITHOUT RUNNING OUT OF STORAGE. THE 7 GB OF FREE SKYDRIVE STORAGE IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT AS I MOSTLY USE IT TO BACKUP MY IMPORTANT STUFF."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THE LUMIA 920 IS AN AMAZING PHONE.. I BOUGHT IT 3 DAYS AGO AND ABSOLUTELY SATISFIED.. ITS WORTH PAYING EVERY SINGLE BUCK.. EVERYTHING IS SO BEAUTIFULL ABOUT THIS PHONE THAT I CANT RESIST MYSELF LOOKING AT IT EVERY 5 MINZ...
      
      REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE, THE ONLY CONCERN IS THE BATTERY LIFE.. MINE WAS LASTING ONLY 5 HRS FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS AND I WAS A BIT WORRIED ABOUT IT, BUT I WENT THROUGH THE NOKIA FORUMS AND READ THREADS REGARDING BATTERY OVER THERE. SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT LI-ION BATTERIES REQUIRE CERTAIN CHARGE CYCLES FOR THE OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE.. AND AFTER 6-8 CHARGE CYCLE BATTERY IS WORKING AS IT SHOULD BE.. GIVING ME 10-12 HRS ON FULL CHARGE WITH HEAVY USAGE..
      
      HIGHLY SATISFIED... WELL DONE NOKIA.."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 HAS MORE THAN LIVED UP TO MY EXPECTIONS. IT HAS A WHOLE HOST OF GREAT FEATURES. IT HAS A UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN THAT IS SUPER SLEEK AND STYLISH. THE LARGE 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN IS EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE TO EVEN THE SOFTEST OF MY TOUCHES DUE TO THE INTEGRATION OF PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. IT IS PROTECTED BY CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 FROM SCRATCHES AND OTHER PHYSICAL DAMAGE. THE PHONE ALSO BOASTS OF A POWERFUL DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR COMBINED WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM.
      
      
      ITS 32 GB ON-BOARD STORAGE LETS ME STORE ALL MY FAVOURITE PICTURES, MUSIC AND VIDEOS. THE PHONE ALSO LETS ME CAPTURE IMAGES WITH ITS BRILLIANT 8.7 MP CAMERA THAT COMES WITH A STATE-OF-THE-ART CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS. THE PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION GUARANTEES THAT THE PHOTOS REMAIN FREE FROM BLUR. INCREASING MY MUSIC COLLECTION HAS ALSO NEVER BEEN SO EASY WITH NOKIA MUSIC AND MIX RADIO LETTING ME DOWNLOAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF REALLY GREAT SONGS. NOKIA MAPS AND DRIVE FEATURED ON THE PHONE IS A WONDERFUL GUIDE FOR TRIPS AND IS FREE OF DATA USAGE!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 WORKS GREAT FOR ME AS IT IS RELIABLE AND COMES WITH A HOST OF GREAT FEATURES. THE PHONE'S 4.5-INCH TOUCHSCREEN RESPONDS WONDERFULLY DUE TO THE PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY PRESENT. THE DISPLAY IS KEPT IN GREAT CONDITION WITH THE CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2. WITH AN EXCELLENT 8.7 MP CAMERA THAT CONTAINS A STATE-OF-THE-ART CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS, MY LUMIA 920 LETS ME CAPTURE QUALITY SNAPS. THE PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION ENSURE THAT SNAPS ARE CLEAR AND FREE FROM BLUR. THE DUAL LED FLASH LETS ME TAKE SNAPS AT NIGHT. NOKIA MUSIC IS A GREAT WAY TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF MY MUSIC LIBRARY WITH AN ASSORTMENT OF DOWNLOADABLE TRACKS FROM MIX RADIO.
      
      
      MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 IS LIGHTNING QUICK DUE TO THE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR COMBINED WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. IT ALSO COMES WITH 32 GB OF ON-BOARD STORAGE WHICH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO STORE ALL MY FAVOURITE PICTURES, MUSIC AND VIDEO. ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE IS NOKIA MAPS AND DRIVE WHICH IS A GREAT APP FOR MY TRAVELLING EXPLOITS. THE BEST PART? IT'S FREE FROM DATA USAGE!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THE PHONE IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTER PIECE. ESPECIALLY WITH THE PRICES SLASHED, ITS WORTH THE MONEY I WOULD SAY. I GOT MY PHONE WITHIN A WEEK OF PLACING MY ORDER.
      
      PROS:
      
      - WINDOWS IS AN AMAZING INTERFACE TO WORK ON. THE OS IS EXTREMELY USER FRIENDLY AND STABLE. ONCE U TOUCH A WINDOWS PHONE, I DOUBT WHETHER YOU WOULD GO BACK TO ANDROID.
      
      - BUTTER SMOOTH OPERATION.
      
      - THE CAMERA QUALITY IS EXQUISITE. SUPER CLARITY PICS AND MANY OTHER FEATURES TO PLAY AROUND WITH.
      
      - NOKIA MUSIC IS A BOON FOR ALL MUSIC LOVERS OUT THERE.
      
      - MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE ANOTHER EXCELLENT AND USER FRIENDLY FEATURE.
      
      - SUFFICIENT STORAGE - 32 GB (AVAILABLE AROUND 28 GB FOR THE USER).
      
      - EXCELLENT PROCESSOR
      
      - EXCELLENT BUILD AND USE OF THE GORILLA GLASS MAKES IT EVEN MORE STABLE.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      - AT THIS PRICE, 1.5 GB RAM WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AWESOME ADDITION. HOWEVER, 1 GB IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR BUTTER SMOOTH OPERATION. ONLY A FEW GAMES WOULD NEED A HIGHER MEMORY.
      
      - LACK OF APPS. HOWEVER, I GOT WATEVER APPS I WANTED. SO THIS ACTUALLY ISN'T A CON FOR ME PERSONALLY.
      
      - BATTERY DRAINS OUT WITHIN A DAY AT MAX (HEAVY USAGE INCLUDES CAMERA, INTERNET (MAIL, WATSAPP ETC.)
      
      - WEIGHS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE COMPETING PHONES IN THE MARKET. BUT 180 ODD GRAMS IS NO BIG DEAL. HOWEVER, IF THE WEIGHT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE, WAIT FOR THE LUMIA 925. REDUCTION OF 60 ODD GRAMS AT THE EXPENSE OF A FEW EXTRA THOUSANDS.
      
      
      OVERALL, AN AMAZING PHONE. WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANY PROSPECTIVE BUYERS.
      
      
      CHEERS!!!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THIS IS A SUPERB DEVICE...WITH AMAZING CAMERA, SCREEN AND REFRESHINGLY NEW METRO UI...AND SUPER SENSITIVE TOUCH (SUPPORTING GLOVE MODE) GREAT OUTDOOR VISIBILITY. UI IS VERY SMOOTH AND BATTERY LASTED 2 DAYS WITH MODERATE USE :)"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THIS IS MY 3RD WINDOWS PHONE. EARLIER I HAD USED HTC RADAR AND HTC TITAN. BEFORE THESE WINDOWS PHONES I HAD BEEN USING IPHONE 3G. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HTC RADAR, EVEN MORE IMPRESSED WITH HTC TITAN BUT NOKIA LUMIA 920 HAS COMPLETELY BOWLED ME OVER. IT IS AN EXCELLENT PHONE WITH GREAT BUILD AND FINISH. THE OS VERSION 8 IS EVEN MORE ADVANCED WITH A FEW VERY NEAT FEATURES OVER WINDOWS PHONE 7.5 LIKE:
      
      1) MULTIPLE ITEM SELECTION TO PERFORM BATCH OPERATIONS
      
      2) FAIRLY CUSTOMIZABLE START SCREEN WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO PACK EVEN MORE LIVE TILES AND MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE.
      
      3) OVER THE AIR OS UPDATES.
      
      4) KID'S CORNER.
      
      5) FAMILY ROOMS.
      
      6) IF YOU ARE BUSY IN MEETING AND YOU RECEIVE A CALL IN THE MIDDLE, YOU CAN NOW HANG THE CALL WITH IMMEDIATE TEXT REPLY MESSAGE. VERY NEAT.
      
      7) WALLPAPERS THAT MAKE SENSE UNLIKE THE USELESS LIVE WALLPAPERS OF ANDROID THAT JUST EAT YOUR BATTERY WITH USELESS ANIMATIONS.
      
      8) NOKIA COLLECTIONS OF APPS INCLUDING CITY LENS, SMART SHOOT, NOKIA DRIVE ETC. WHICH ARE FAR BETTER THAN ANY OF THE APPS PROVIDED BY OTHER SMARTPHONE MANUFACTURERS.
      
      
      THE BEST PART HOWEVER IS THE CAMERA. ITS A BLITZ TO USE. THE PHOTO QUALITY IOS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.
      
      
      FROM MY SIDE THIS PHONE IS A MUST BUY! NOKIA IS BACK!"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"THIS IS THE BEST THING YOUR MONEY CAN BUY..

DON'T TELL ME ANDROID WAS PERFECT SINCE DAY 1... MOREOVER.. YOU TALK ABOUT MULTI-TASKING.. ITS THE SAME AS IOS.
      
      
      BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK AT SPECS TO BUY YOUR PHONE.. ANDROID NEEDS QUAD-OCTA-MEGA CORES TO RUN.. AND ON TOP OF THAT JELLYBEAN TOO.. THIS OS IS SILKY SMOOTH EVEN ON A CHEAP PHONE AS LUMIA 520..
      
      
      THIS IS NOT THE BEST OUT THERE.. BUT ITS VERY GOOD AND BEST THING THAT THIS PHONE HAS IS ITS DIFFERENT.. ITS VIVID TO USE.. ITS FRESH LOOK N FEEL.. ITS LIVELY.. N WITH UPDATES COMING IN ITS BECOMING BETTER N BETTER...."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"TRULY AMAZING! IF YE ARE A NOKIA FAN, UPON THAT WINDOWS OS LOVER, THEN PLEASE DON'T THINK OF ANY SHITTING PHONES 1 LIKE SAMSUNG, IT JUST EATS UP YOUR MONEY! THE SAMSUNG PHONES LOOK COOL 'N' HUGE IN THE BEGINNING WITH ALL AWESOME APPS PROVIDED WITH ANDROID OS.. BUT AS TIME PASSES, THE PHONES BEGIN TO GET MAD! (IF YE KNOW WHAT I MEAN).
      
      THEY LOSE THEIR CAPACITY IN SPEED. UNLIKE THE NOKIA PHONES ARE 1 OF THE BEST I'VE KNOWN!
      
      MY EXPERIENCE WITH LUMIA 920 IS GOING AMAZING. THOUGH WINDOWS IS NEW OS 'N' STILL NEED TO SET A STRONGER BASE, IT PROVIDES ALL ESSENTIAL APPS FOR FREE. FEW AWESOME XBOX GAMES DO COST BUT ONLY FOR A WHILE.
      
      BUT SPEAKING ABOUT THE HARDWARE, IT IS THE BEST WITH MOST TOUGH POLY CARBONATED BODY 'N' THE GORILLA GLASS PROTECTION.
      
      THE DISPLAY IS CRYSTAL CLEAR WITH PURE MOTION HD, ALSO THE CAMERA BEING PROVIDED WITH 1 OF THE BEST CARL ZEISS LENS WITH PURE VIEW. 'N' THE BRIGHTNESS 'N' CONTRAST IS NOT TO WORRY NOW, B'CAUSE ITS ALL AUTOMATIC ON THE LUMIA 920. EVEN THE VOLUME OF YOUR MP3 PLAYBACK IS BEING REGULATED BASED ON THE NOISE ON YOUR BACKGROUND!!
      
      ADDITIONAL FEATURES FROM NOKIA LIKE HERE DRIVE, CITY LENS, WALLET, CINEMA-GRAPH, SMART SHOOT 'N' LOT MORE COOL APPS ARE ALL AVAILABLE FOR FREE WHILE SOME COME WITH THE MANUFACTURE SETTINGS!
      
      THE MICROSOFT OFFICE 365, IS ANOTHER INTERESTING FEATURE IN-BUILT. YE CAN ""EDIT OR CREATE"" THE ""WORD, EXCEL 'N' PRESENTATION DOCS, USING THE ALREADY SAVED SAMPLE SPREADSHEETS.
      
      AND MOST OF ALL, VERY ATTRACTIVE FEATURE OF THIS PHONE IS THE ""WIRELESS CHARGING"".
      
      NO OTHER SO CALLED FAMOUS SMART PHONES LIKE THE ""SAMSUNG OR APPLE"" GIVES YE THIS FACILITY.
      
      THE TOUCH IS VERY SENSITIVE 'N' FRIENDLY.
      
      IF YE THOUGHT OF BUYING A LUMIA 920, THEN GO FOR IT, YE'VE MADE THE ""BEST CHOICE""..!! :)"
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"WHAT COULD MAKE A MOBILE PROFESSIONAL HAPPIER THAN A POWERFUL AND SMART COMMUNICATION DEVICE LIKE THE NOKIA LUMIA 920!

I JUST LOVE THE UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN OF MY LUMIA 920. NOT TO MENTION ITS BEAUTIFUL 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY THAT COMES WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. THIS NOT JUST MAKES FOR BRIGHTER VISUALS, BUT ALSO PROVIDES GREATER CLARITY AND A HIGHER RESOLUTION. WITH CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION, THIS DISPLAY IS TOUGH AND HAS SURVIVED SOME ROUGH USE. OUR OFFICE MEETS AND EVENTS GENERALLY HAVE ME COVERING THE EVENT WITH MY LUMIA 920?S AWESOME 8.7 MP CAMERA. ITS CARL ZEISS OPTICS, PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION MEAN THAT MY PHOTOS AND VIDEOS ARE TOTALLY BLUR-FREE AND THE PICS ARE MOSTLY IN DEMAND AFTER I CLICK. I CAN EVEN CLICK PRISTINE QUALITY SNAPS AT NIGHT DUE TO THE INTEGRATED DUAL LED FLASH. THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM ON MY NOKIA SMARTPHONE IS A BOON. IT NOT JUST SIMPLIFIES STUFF AND TASKS, BUT ALSO LOOKS GOOD DOING IT. THE LIVE TILES FEATURE IS MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE BECAUSE IT LETS ME ARRANGE ALL MY FAVOURITE APPS RIGHT ON MY HOME SCREEN WAITING FOR A TAP OF MY FINGERS TO ACTIVATE THEM. ALL MY FRIENDS, DEAR ONES AND COLLEAGUES ARE TAGGED TO MY HOME SCREEN USING PEOPLE HUB SO THAT I RECEIVE ALL OF THEIR SOCIAL NETWORKING UPDATES ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY.

I CAN NOW TRAVEL TO MY DESTINATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO ASK AROUND FOR DIRECTIONS, AS THESE APPS OFFER TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS EVEN WITHOUT DATA USAGE!

WITH NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION OR NFC, 3G, LTE, WI-FI AND WLAN COMPLETING THE GAMUT OF CONNECTIVITY FEATURES ON MY LUMIA 920, THERE PRETTY MUCH NOTHING MORE THAT I COULD ASK FOR."
Nokia Lumia 920,5,"WHEN OUT IN THE MARKET LOOKING FOR SMARTPHONES, I REMEMBER THE NUMBER OF TIMES I HAVE RETURNED EMPTY HANDED, PERPLEXED BY THE LARGESSE OF UNWANTED FEATURES, THE LACK OF USEFUL ONES AND SKY-ROCKETING PRICES.

I GOT MYSELF ONE AFTER I RESEARCHED AND ANALYSED IT UMPTEEN TIMES ON THE WEB. I HAVE GOT TO SAY THAT MY LUMIA 920 IS A GREAT BUY AND TOTALLY WORTH ITS PRICE.

THE BUILT-IN WIRELESS CHARGING FEATURE OF THIS PHONE LETS ME CHARGE MY PHONE WITH THE HELP OF A COLOURFUL CHARGING PLATE OR FATBOY PILLOW."""
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"ABSOLUTELY UNUSABLE IN BED, THE CORNERS PRICK MY HAD WHEN I TRY TO TYPE, AND WINDOWS PHONE 8 DOESN'T LET ME TURN OFF SCREEN ROTATION WHICH IS A PAIN (HOPE THIS COMES IN A FURTHER UPDATE)!
      
      
      THE PHONE IS BUILT ROCK SOLID AND FEELS VERY PREMIUM, MY BROTHER HAS A SGS3 AND COMPARATIVELY MY 920 IS MUCH BETTER.
      
      
      THE BRIGHTNESS CAN BE ADJUSTED TO ONLY THREE LEVELS, LOW, MEDIUM AND HIGH. WITH LOW STILL BEING PRETTY BRIGHT. AUTO BRIGHTNESS WORKS LIKE A CHARM AND BRINGS BRIGHTNESS TO A MUCH LOWER LEVEL THAN THE DEFAULT ""LOW"" SETTING, BUT I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE THAT MANUALLY SO AS TO CONSERVE MY BATTERY.
      
      
      BATTERY LASTS A DAY IF USED JUDICIOUSLY. IT WAS VERY AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS, WHICH DISAPPOINTED ME, BUT IT IMPROVED DRASTICALLY AFTER A COUPLE OF FULL CHARGES AND DISCHARGES! :O
      
      
      NOKIA MUSIC, NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA CITY LENS. DAMN!! LOVE THESE. AND ALSO THE FACT THAT I GET A FREE SUBSCRIPTION TO NOKIA MUSIC FOR AN YEAR (LEGAL, HQ MUSIC) GETS ME EVERY TIME. IT EVEN HAS MALAYALAM AND TAMIL MUSIC APART FROM HINDI AND WORLD.
      
      
      I CAN DOWNLOAD ATTACHMENTS FROM EMAIL BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT GETS STORED, WHICH MEANS THAT I CANNOT DELETE THEM MANUALLY. THEY GET DELETED AUTOMATICALLY AS AND WHEN THE EMAIL GETS DELETED FROM MY INBOX (SYNC SETTINGS ALLOW YOU TO SYNC EMAIL FROM THE PAST 3 DAYS, PAST 7 DAYS, PAST 2 WEEKS AND ANY TIME).
      
      
      THERE ISN'T A FILE MANAGER WHICH LETS ME BROWSE THROUGH THE FILES ON MY PHONE. YOU CANNOT FIND ONE ON THE WINDOWS MARKETPLACE EITHER.
      
      
      BUT OF COURSE, YOU CAN DRAG AND DROP FILES TO AND FROM YOUR PC WHICH MAKES TRANSFERRING SONGS AND VIDEOS BETWEEN MY PHONE AND PC VERY EASY.
      
      
      WINDOWS PHONE 8 IS FLUIDIC, DOES NOT CRASH OR HANG AND IS EXTREMELY USER FRIENDLY (MIGHT TAKE YOU A DAY OR TWO OR EVEN THREE TO GET USED TO IT THOUGH). THE FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND EMAIL INTEGRATION WORKS LIKE A CHARM. IT IS MUCH CLEANER AND EXCITING THAN ANDROID, THOUGH NOT AS CUSTOMISABLE.
      
      
      COMING FROM A SAMSUNG GALAXY SII RUNNING JELLYBEAN, THESE ARE THE THINGS I LIKED AND DISLIKED ABOUT THE LUMIA 920.
      
      
      OVERALL I AM SATISFIED WITH THE 920, AND DOES NOT REGRET MY DECISION TO BUY A WINDOWS PHONE."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"AFTER THOROUGHLY CHECKING FOR SOME COOL PHONES AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET, I OPTED FOR THE NOKIA LUMIA 820. DESPITE THE HYPE THAT ANDROID AND IOS BEING THE LEADERS IN THE UI CATEGORY, I STILL DECIDED TO TRY OUT THE NEW WINDOWS 8 OS. AND ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT WINDOWS 8 OS IS THAT IT REALLY IS ENGAGING AND UNIQUE. THE FIRST THING I DID WAS THAT I GOT SOME TRENDY INTERCHANGEABLE BACK COVERS THAT WOULD ALSO MATCH WITH MY ATTIRE. INSIDE THE SHINY AND GLOSSY EXTERIOR, THERE LIES A DUAL CORE 1.5 GHZ SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR AND ADRENO 225 GPU WHICH TAKES YOU THROUGH THE DAY?S WORK WITHOUT ANY GLITCHES. THE 1 GB RAM MAKES THE PROCESSOR PERFECT FOR HEAVY DUTY TASKS WITHOUT ANY SINGLE INSTANCE OF LAG. THE 4.3-INCH AMOLED TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY GIVES HIGHLY VIVID AND COLOURFUL EXPERIENCE. WITH AN EASY TOUCH OR PINCH OF THE FINGERS, I CAN QUITE EASILY SWIPE OR ZOOM THROUGH THE IMAGES. THE WINDOWS 8 OS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE AMONG THE OTHER INTERESTING FEATURES OF THE PHONE. THE OS OFFERS A LIVE TILES DISPLAY WITH AN OPTION OF ADDING MY FAVOURITE APPS TO THE HOME SCREEN. ALL MY FRIENDS ARE PINNED TO THESE TILES USING PEOPLE HUB. IN THIS WAY, I CAN VIEW THEIR STATUS UPDATES WITHOUT TAKING THE TROUBLE OF LOGGING ONTO SOCIAL NETWORKING WEB SITES OR NAVIGATING TO THEIR PROFILE PAGES. I CAN ALSO POST MY STATUS UPDATES ON FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN AND TWITTER SIMULTANEOUSLY.
      
      OTHER NOTABLE APPS ON THE LUMIA 820 ARE INTERNET EXPLORER 10 AND BING WHICH I AM QUITE FAMILIAR WITH ON MY PERSONAL PC. BY OPTING FOR AN APPROPRIATE 3G DATA PLAN, I CAN EASILY BROWSE WEB PAGES, SEND OR RECEIVE EMAILS OR STREAM ONLINE CONTENT JUST LIKE WE TASK IT ON COMPUTERS. I LOVE CLICKING SNAPS PARTICULARLY WHEN I GO ON TRIPS WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY. MY LUMIA 820?S 8 MP CAMERA QUITE EASILY TAKES UP THE TASK OF CLICKING PICTURES AND SHOOTING HD VIDEOS FOR ME. THE F2.2 APERTURE CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS INSIDE THE CAMERA LETS ME CLICK HIGH RESOLUTION AND LIVELY PICTURES. I AM ALSO QUITE A FAN OF THE PANORAMIC MODE WHICH CAN TAKE WIDE SWEEPING PHOTOS. THE CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS IS CAPABLE OF RECORDING 1080P HD QUALITY VIDEOS. MY LUMIA 820 IS EQUIPPED WITH 8 GB INTERNAL MEMORY WHICH PROMISES ABUNDANT SPACE AND EXPANDED UPTO 32 GB MICROSD CARD SO YOU DON?T HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON MEMORY WHEN IT COMES TO CLICKING PICTURES OR RECORDING VIDEOS.
      
      MY LUMIA 820 HAS MANY CONNECTIVITY FEATURES LIKE BLUETOOTH, NFC AND WI-FI FOR FILE TRANSFER AND DATA BROWSING REQUIREMENTS AT LIGHTNING FAST SPEEDS. A-GPS SUPPORT WITH APPS LIKE NOKIA DRIVE AND NOKIA MAPS PROVIDE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT WHILE TRAVELLING WITH TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATION."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"AFTER WAITING FOR YEARS, I FINALLY GOT MY MUCH AWAITED DREAM PHONE - THE NOKIA LUMIA 920. COMPARED TO THE GALAXY S III DIRECTLY UNDER THE SUN, THE LUMIA 920'S DISPLAY IS A LOT CLEARER AND LESS WASHED OUT. ITS 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY IS AMAZINGLY SENSITIVE AND SMOOTH WITH SLIGHTLY CURVED DESIGN AND PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. I HAVE EXPERIENCED ENHANCED VISIBILITY AND GREAT PICTURE QUALITY. I CAN WATCH VIDEOS AND MOVIES WITHOUT FEELING EXHAUSTED OR GETTING MY EYES TIRED. CALLING AND MAINTAINING CONTACTS IS EXTREMELY CONVENIENT. I HAVE ALL OF THEM RIGHT ON MY HOMESCREEN ALONG WITH SOCIAL NETWORK UPDATES FROM FRIENDS. THANKS TO THE ME TILES AND WINDOWS 8 MAGIC, I?M MUCH MORE POPULAR AND UPBEAT. AT WORK, I CAN STILL KEEP UP WITH MY FRIENDS BY CONNECTING WITH THEM ON FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN AND TWITTER. WHILE I?M ON THE MOVE, I CAN EDIT AND VIEW MS OFFICE DOCUMENTS AND VIEW PDFS. YOU CAN EXPECT EXCELLENT CLARITY IN IMAGES FROM THE 8.7 MP CAMERA THAT INTEGRATES A CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS. THE PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY ENABLES HIGH CLARITY, LOW-DISTORTION IMAGES.  WHEN I CAPTURED MY BEST FRIEND?S VIDEO, THERE WAS NO HAZY BLUR IN SPITE OF SO MUCH DANCING! OPTICAL STABILIZATION, MAGICALLY REDUCED MOTION BLUR AND BEAUTIFUL VIDEOS OF HIGH QUALITY FLATTERED ALL THE GUESTS. IN FACT, THEY WERE MUCH BETTER THAN THE PROFESSIONAL VIDEOS.  THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 FEATURES A STYLISH LOOKING EXTERIOR. ITS UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN LOOKS VERY CLASSY AND IS YET EXTREMELY LIGHT. IT SLIPS INTO MY POCKET PERFECTLY.
      
      IT IS STUFFED WITH FEATURES INSIDE AND LOOKS STUNNING OUTSIDE. IT HAS A POWERFUL DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR IN COMBINATION WITH THE ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP. ALL OF MY HIGH RESOLUTION GAMES AND APPS OPEN EASILY AND ARE SO EASY TO PLAY. THE PHONE?S 1 GB RAM MEMORY EASILY ACCOMMODATES DATA AND MAKES MULTI-TASKING SEAMLESSLY ENTERTAINING. THE EXTENDABLE 32GB MEMORY ACCOMMODATES ALL MY PERSONAL DATA, FAVOURITE MUSIC AND MOVIES ON IT. BECAUSE OF THIS MY PHONE DOES NOT BECOME SLOW TIME AND AGAIN. NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE ARE MY FAVOURITE FEATURES. I CAN GO TO ANY PLACE I DESIRE WITHOUT THE FEAR OF GETTING LOST. NOKIA LUMIA 920 IS A TREAT FOR THE ULTIMATE MUSIC LOVER IN ME. WHILE GOING TO WORK OR ON MY WAY BACK I CAN CHILL WITH ALL MY FAVOURITE SONGS THANKS TO NOKIA MUSIC STORE AND MIX RADIO. DOWNLOADING SONGS IS FUN, FAST AND FAB WITHOUT ANY DATA USAGE. NOKIA ROCKS FOR THIS! SHARING SONGS WITH FRIENDS ONLINE IS SO EASY TOO. THE PHONE SUPPORTS3G, LTE, WI-FI, WLAN AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTING YOU TO YOUR WORLD WHEREVER YOU GO! I AM SURE IT IS AN INSTANT HIT WITH YOUTH THAT FOLLOWS THE NOKIA BRAND LOYALTY. THE BEST PART ABOUT MY LUMIA 920 IS THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR A WIRED CHARGER!"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,CAMERA CLARITY IS NOT GOOD FOR THIS PRICE RANGE I AM USED THIS PHONES 3 DAYS I AM CAPTURE IMAGES PHONE VIEW IS ALSO GOOD WHEN IAM TRANSFER IMAGE TO MY LAP BUT CLARITY IS NOT GOOD ........SELECT SONY OR HTC ITS AMAZING CAMERA CLARITY
Nokia Lumia 920,4,EVERYTHING SAID AND DONE ITS A GREAT PHONE I KINDA LIKE WINDOWS OS TOO DOES EVERYTHING I ASKED IT TO THE DAILY STUFF I USE PHONE WAS SMOOTH FLAWLESS AND YES I WOULD TRUST NOKIA HARDWARE OVER SAMSUNG N EVEN APPLE N THE TRUSTED AFTER SALES BUT BUT BUT 37K IS A BIT ASKING TOO MUCH IF IT WAS AROUND 32-33 I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT BY NOW ITS 5K TOO MUCH
Nokia Lumia 920,4,FABULOUS PHONE.I SHOULD SAY THAT IAM VERY MUCH DOUBTFUL BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE.BUT IAM VERY HAPPY AFTER USING THE PHONE.BUY THIS PHONE WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED.LIVE TILES BRING FRESHNESS.IT IS WAY BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS ANDROID PHONE NOTE 2
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"HI ALL. I RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS PHONE FROM A RETAILER. ALL ARE GOOD EXCEPT FOR THE BATTERY. IT DRAINS PRETTY FAST AND THE TOP OF THE MOBILE GETS HEATED UP. IVE EVEN CHECKED SOME ONLINE NOKIA FORUMS. EVERYONE IS FACING THE SAME ISSUE AND ARE EXPECTING A RESOLUTION FOR THIS. EVEN THE NOKIA TEAM IS WORKING ON THIS TO FIX THE ISSUE.
      
      
      HOPE THIS HELPS...CHEERS :)"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"I AM USING 920 FROM LAST 4 MONTHS &AMP; HERE ARE SOME REVIEWS...
      
      1)IT'S CAMERA IS REALLY AWESOME....LOWLIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY &AMP; IT'S APP CREATIVE STUDIO IS JUST LIKE PICASA &AMP; EVEN BETTER.
      
      2)MUSIC &AMP; NOKIA MAPS ARE ALSO GOOD &AMP; THEY ARE KEEP UPDATING THERE MAPS .THERE'S A DOLBY DIGITAL FUNCTION FOR MUSIC WHICH GIVES PERFECT SND IN MY SIBERIA HEADPHONE
      
      3)IT'S BATTERY BACKUP IS REALLY GOOD ...4 DAYS WITHOUT NET &AMP; GAMING APPLICATION.......2 DAYS MAX WITH NET.OFCOURSE OTHER SMARTPHONES LIKE S3 ,Z CAN LAST 4-6 HOURS LONGER WITH NET.
      
      4)APPLICATION LIKE TEMPLE RUN INSTAGRAM ARE AVAILABLE &AMP; I HOPE MICROSOFT WILL PROVIDE MORE APPLICATION SOONS.
      
      5)VIDEO QUALITY IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER HANDSET AVAILABLE .I DID COMPARE IT'S SCREEN QUALITY WITH OTHER MOBILES LIKE S3,4S,Z(EXCEPT S4 &AMP; LUMIA 925) BUT THERE'S NO MATCH WITH 920.
      
      
      CONS
      
      1)MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS ARE PAID WHICH I REALLY HATE ABOUT MICROSOFT.
      
      2)APPLICATIONS LIKE TEMPLE RUN 2 &AMP; SUBWAY SURFER ARE YET TO BE RELEASE.
      
      
      OVERALL IT'S A GOOD PHONE I'LL GIVE 4.5 STARS."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"I GOT THIS PHONE JUST A DAY AFTER ITS LAUNCH( WILL TELL LATER WHY I GOT IT FROM NOKIA PRIORITY)
      
      
      THIS IS THE BEST PHONE FROM NOKIA TILL NOW...
      
      PROS:-
      
      ITS BLACK MAT FINISH AT THE BACK IS GOOD, HOWEVER MIGHT GET TINY SCRATCHES.
      
      BEST PART IS ITS CAMERA AND THE CLEAR BLACK DISPLAY. ITS TRUE THAT IN SUNLIGHT THIS PHONE HAS THE BEST DISPLAY. CAMERA HAS BEST PICTURES IN LOW LIGHT FOR WHICH ITS FAMOUS.
      
      BUILD QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD. FIRST THING YOU WILL NOTICE ONCE YOU CATCH THE PHONE IN YOUR HAND IS THAT THIS PHONE WILL STAY WITH YOU FOR LONG TIME, ITS DURABLE.
      
      LAUDSPEAKER IS DESCENT ENOUGH AND SPECIALLY THE DOLBY ENGINE IS VERY GOOD ONCE YOU ARE WITH EARPHONES.( BUY MONSTER EARPHONES FROM NOKIA AVAILABLE IN NOKIA PRIORITY)
      
      A BIT HEAVY BUT NOT TOO MUCH THAT YOU WILL FEEL ITS A BRICK ;)
      
      
      PEOPLE SAY THAT THERE ARE VERY LESS APPS IN WINDOWS, I MAY NOT COMPLETELY AGREE BUT YES TO SOME EXTENT YOU FEEL THAT THE REQUIRED APPS LIKE PRODUCTIVITY APPS AND BANKING APPS(SPECIALLY FOR INDIA) ARE NOT PRESENT.
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      WINDOWS OS STIL NEEDS A LOT OF UPDATES.
      
      THE BATTERY SIGN SHOWING AT THE TOP WILL NEVER SHOW YOU PERCENTAGE SO ITS DIFFICULT WITHT E TINY PIC OF BATTERY TO JUDGE HOW MUCH ITS LEFT.
      
      THERE IS NO SHORTCUT BY NOKIA FOR DAILY OPTIONS SUCH AS WIFI, MOBILE DATA, BLUETOOTH(BLUETOOTH WORKS FINE TOO), AIRPLANE MODE, SCREEN ROTATION TURN ON/OFF.
      
      I DIDNT FIND A OPTION TO TURN OFF THE SCREEN ROTATION IN SETTINGS TOO, WILL HAVE TO CHECK AGAIN THOUGH. VERY SAD THING.. SHOULD HAVE A NOTIFICATION AREA WHERE YOU HAVE ALL THE SHORTCUTS AND PUSH NOTIFICATIONS.... YES I KNOW THERE ARE LIVE TILES BUT HOW MANY TILES WILL YOU PUT ON A 4.5 INCH SCREEN AND ITS NOT A COMBINED TILE FOR ALL NOTIFICATIONS
      
      
      BELIEVE ME DONT TAKE THIS PHONE IF YOU ARE A GAMER. ITS SOMEHOW NOT A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH GAMES AND THERE ARE VERY LESS IN THE WINDOWS MARKETPLACE
      
      I DONT PLAY GAMES ON CELL PHONE SO AS OF NOW APART FROM FEW WINDOWS DRAWBACKS THE PHONE IS GOOD..
      
      
      YES AND ONE MORE VERY PATHETIC EXPERIENCE IS THE MUSIC PLAYER OF WINDOWS ... ITS VERY POORLY DESIGNER. IF I HAVE 899 ODD SONGS ON MY PHONE AND I WANT TO SEARCH A SONG WITH A KEYWORD WHICH THEN I CANNOT.
      
      YOU HAVE TO SEARCH WITH THE STARTING LETTER OF THE SONG ONLY. THERE IS NO SEARCH BUTTON OR SEARCH WINDOW EVEN TO SEARCH THE SONGS.
      
      THERE ARE LETTERS LIKE A,B,C,D AND THEN CLICK ON A LETTER TO SEARCH SONGS STARTING FROM THAT LETTER.... VERY VERY SAD WINDOWS MUSIC PLAYER"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"I HAVE USED LUMIA 920 FOR ABOUT 4 WEEKS. THE WINDOWS 8 INTERFACE IS SILKY SMOOTH. OS HAS NOT HANGED EVEN ON HEAVY USAGE. THE HD - 1280 X 768 PIXELS DISPLAY MAKES WATCHING VIDEOS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.
      
      THE PURE-VIEW CAMERA FEATURE IS A NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCE. AUTOMATICALLY CLEARS OUT THE BLURS AND LOW LIGHT IMAGE CAPTURES ARE GREATLY ENHANCED BY THE APERTURE OF F/20, WHICH IS HIGHEST IN CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SMART PHONES.
      
      THE BATTERY SAVER OPTION ALLOWS SUFFICIENT CHARGE TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ENTIRE DAY EVEN IF I HAVE USE 3G TO SURF AND PLAY GAMES.
      
      MUSIC DOWNLOADS FROM THE NOKIA MUSIC STORE HAPPEN AT BLAZING SPEED AND STORE OFFERS A HUGE COLLECTION.
      
      HOWEVER THE PHONES QUICKLY GETS HEATED UP ON PLAYING GAMES FOR 20 MINS. ALTHOUGH NOKIA CARE SAYS THAT THE HEATING IS WITHIN THE ALLOWABLE LIMITS, BUT I PERSONALLY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PLACE IT ON MY EARS IN SUCH CONDITION. HAVE TRIED TO TRANSFER A IMAGE TO ANOTHER LUMIA720 THROUGH NFC BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. IN FACT 720 HANGED AND WAS REQUIRED TO BE HARD REBOOTED.
      
      AND A CONSIDERABLE FACT IS THE AVAILABILITY OF LESS NUMBER OF WINDOWS MOBILE APPLICATIONS AS COMPARED TO ANDROID."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"I WAS A NOKIA USER A LONG TIME AGO, N8 TO 808 AND 808 WENT TO MY WIFE AND I GOT THE GALAXY S3. HERE ARE THE REASONS I SWITCHED FROM S3 TO WINDOWS PHONE NOKIA 720 TO 920
      
      THE 720 GOT WET IN THE RAIN AND IS BEYOND REPAIR:(, AND THEN I MOVED TO 920 BY SELLING MY GALAXY S3.
      
      THE POINT NUMBERS MATCH B/W THE S3 AND THE 920
      
      1. THE PHONE USED TO RANDOMLY REBOOT AT TIMES
      
      2. AFTER ABOUT 100 HOURS OF USAGE THE PHONE WOULD BECOME VERY SLOW I HAD TO REBOOT
      
      3. UNPREDICTABLE BATTERY LIFE, I LIKE TO KEEP WIFI ON THROUGHOUT THE DAY. SUPPOSE YOU FORGET TO CLOSE SOME APP, IT DRAINS YOUR BATTERY VERY QUICKLY
      
      4. UI OF THE APPS IS TOO CLUTTERED YOU HAVE ONE BIG SCREEN WITH LOTS OF BUTTONS HERE AND THERE AND EACH APP CAN CHOOSE WHERE IT CAN PLACE THE BUTTONS. WITH THE HUGE SCREENS OF THE S3/4 YOU HAVE TO REACH YOUR FINGER TO THE BUTTON FROM CORNER TO CORNER, SINGLE HANDED USE IS IMPOSSIBLE.
      
      5. NOTORIOUS APPS THAN CAN SUCK YOUR DATA PLAN AND BATTERY
      
      6. CALL DROPS INSIDE ELEVATORS AT WORK (SIGNAL BOOSTERS INSTALLED IN WORK PLACE)
      
      7. LOUSY AND PICS/VIDEOS ON THE CAMERA
      
      
      AFTER SWITCHING TO LUMIA
      
      1. EXCELLENT STABLITY, I DON'T KNOW WHEN MY PHONE REBOOTED OR WHEN I REBOOTED, REBOOTS ONLY WHEN I RUN OUT OF JUICE, WHICH IS AGAIN RARE.
      
      2. EXCELLENT STANDBY TIME. I UNPLUG IN THE NIGHT AND LEAVE THE PHONE ON (WIFI AND MOBILE DATA SHUTOFF) IT IS STILL 100 % IN THE MORNING. I USE GPS TRACKING FOR 30 MINS WHEN I CYCLE TO WORK, I REACH OFFICE AND IT STILL IS AT 100 %!! THAT IS INSANE. I NEVER TURN OFF GPS
      
      3. WINDOWS PHONE, THE OS HAS THIS THING CALLED FREEZE, IT SHUTS DOWN APPS THAT ARE NOT IN BACKGROUND IF THERE IS NO ACTIVITY, THAT WAY EVEN IF I LEAVE AN APP RUNNING IT DOES NOT DRAIN BATTERY.
      
      4. EXCELLENT UI AND ALWAYS PREDICTABLE KNOW WHERE THE MENU'S ARE LOCATED, AND A SIMPLE SWIPE TO RIGHT OR LEFT WILL GET THE JOB DONE. I ALWAYS LIKE THE SINGLE HANDED USE OF THE LUMIA 720, 920 IS A BIT LARGE BUT I CAN STILL MANAGE.
      
      5. APPS ARE NOT MUCH, BUT MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR ME, WHAT EVER APPS ARE AVAILABLE THEY BEHAVE CORRECTLY AND INTEGRATE WELL WITH THE OS. MS HAS BEEN DOING SOME STRICT MONITORING.
      
      6. I HAVE NOT HAD A SINGLE CALL DROP IN ELEVATORS AT WORK. IF THERE IS NO SIGNAL, WELL NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT, PHONE INDICATES THAT THERE IS NO SIGNAL.
      
      7. EXCELLENT PICS AND VIDEOS, I HAVE THE LATEST FIRMWARE, THE OLDER FIRMWARE HAD ISSUES WITH COLOURS AND DAYLIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY. I GET EXCELLENT INDOOR SHOTS AS GOOD AS SOME COMPACT CAMERAS
      
      
      I AM A POWER USER, I HAVE CONFIGURED 4 EMAIL ID'S ON THE PHONE, MY WORK EMAIL IS SET SYNC AS THE MAIL ARRIVES ALL OTHER EMAIL SYNC EVERY HOUR, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE CONTACTS, I HAVE ABOUT 10 GAMES, I PLAY ABOUT 15 TO 30 MINS DAILY. I MAINLY USE FOR FACEBOOK AND EMAIL. SOMETIMES YOUTUBE. MS TOOK THE YOU-TUBE APP OFF :(
      
      I AM IMPRESSED WITH THE PHONE,
      
      THE ONLY THING NAGGING ME IS THE VOLUME CONTROL, THE VOLUME CONTROL FROM SPEAKER AND HEADPHONE IS THE SAME :( IT IS THE STUPIDEST THING IN THE PHONE. I HOPE IT GETS FIXED IN THE UPCOMING UPDATE FROM MS.
      
      BTW I DID NOT BUY THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"I WAS WAITING FOR BUDGET TO BUY THIS PHONE, EXPECTING THAT THE EXCISE DUTY WILL BE REDUCED. BUY THIS PHONE RIGHT AFTER GOVT ANNOUNCES 5% INCREASE(AGAINST EXPECTATION) IN DUTY ON PHONE MORE THAN RS.2000.
      
      DELIVERY OF THE PHONE WAS REALLY QUICK, GOT THE PHONE VERY NEXT DAY.
      
      
      EVERYONE HAS SAID MUCH ABOUT ITS QUALITIES AND YES THEY ARE TRUE. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION CERTAIN DRAWBACKS.
      
      1. 2000MAH BATTERY. REQUIRE 2 TIMES FULL CHARGE IN A DAY. ALSO BATTERY IS INBUILT SO KEEPING AN ADDITIONAL BATTERY IS OUT OF EQUATION.
      
      2. CAN'T SHARE VIDEOS VIA BLUETOOTH.
      
      3. CAN'T SHARE AUDIO AND VIDEO IN YOUR PHONE USING WATSAPP.
      
      4. CAN'T PICK YOUR FAV. RINGTONES, ONLY NOKIA AND WINDOWS RINGTONES ARE ALLOWED.
      
      6. IF YOU ARE DOWNLOADING SOMETHING OTHER THAN NOKIA MUSIC STORE, IT WONT BE SHOWN IN YOUR MUSIC, VIDEOS OR PICTURE.
      
      7. NO OPTION TO CREATE FOLDER OR MOVING OBJECT FROM ONE FOLDER TO ANOTHER IN THE PHONE, CONNECT WITH COMPUTER THAN YOU CAN.
      
      
      MY STAND IS EXCEPT BATTERY OTHER DRAWBACKS ARE NEGOTIABLE. I JUST GET TO KNOW THOSE CONS AFTER USING THIS PHONE. SO KEEP THIS THINGS IN MIND WHILE BUYING WINDOWS PHONE.
      
      NOW WHAT IS EXCITING.
      
      EXCELLENT PHONE TO USE, GREAT BUILD, POLYCARBONATE FEEL GR8 TO HOLD, REFRESHING OS.
      
      CAMERA IS THE BEST PART OF IT. LOTS OF APPLICATIONS(THOUGH LESS THAN ANDROID AND IOS BUT IF YOU COMPARE THE INITIAL VERSION OF ANDROID AND IOS, WINDOWS DID PROVIDED A LARGE NO OF APPLICATION AND INCREASING DAY BY DAY).
      
      OVERALL A GOOD OPTION TO GO.
      
      THIS PHONE AND WHOLE SERIES OF LUMIA WILL AGAIN ESTABLISH NOKIA IN THE MARKET. I HAD GIVEN 4 STARS CZ THERE IS NO OPTION TO GIVE 4.5."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"IF THERE WAS EVER A POLL FOR THE BEST SMARTPHONE AVAILABLE TODAY, I WOULD VOTE FOR THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 BASED ON THE CRITERION OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND A RICH FEATURE SET. I SWITCHED FROM MY SAMSUNG WAVE III TO THE LUMIA 920 AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY DECISION. EVEN THE SWITCH FROM BADA OS TO WINDOWS PHONE 8 HAS BEEN SEAMLESS. I LOVE THIS PHONE BECAUSE IT ALMOST SEEMS TO ADD MORE STYLE TO MY PERSONALITY. ITS UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN IS JUST SO STRIKING, THAT I HAVE CAUGHT MANY A PEOPLE GLANCING JEALOUSLY AT IT. MY LUMIA 920 GOES WITH ME WHEREVER I GO, AND I CLICK AWESOME SNAPS IN BRILLIANT QUALITY WITH THE 8.7 MP CAMERA. THE KEY TO THIS CAMERA?S BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE IS THE CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS AND PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY. EVEN THE VIDEOS I RECORD WHEN IN MOTION, SUCH AS FROM WHEN WALKING OR RUNNING, COME OUT BLUR-FREE DUE TO THE INTEGRATED OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION FEATURE. MY NEXT POINT OF ADDICTION IN THIS PHONE IS ITS 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY THAT FEATURES PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. ITS SLIGHTLY CURVED DESIGN LENDS ITSELF WELL TO THE NATURAL SWIPING OF FINGERS AND IS RESISTANT TO SCRATCHES AND ABRASIONS DUE TO ITS CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 TECHNOLOGY. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, THE TRANSITION TO WINDOWS 8 HAS BEEN GREAT. I JUST LOVE THE TILED INTERFACE THAT THIS OPERATING SYSTEM BRINGS TO THE TABLE, WITH LARGE ICONS AND UP-FRONT NOTIFICATIONS. FEATURES SUCH AS THE PEOPLEHUB ARE SO CONVENIENT AND ACCESSIBLE, AS I GET ALL THE UPDATES OF MY FRIENDS FROM VARIOUS SOCIAL NETWORKS RIGHT ON MY HOME SCREEN. WITH THE NATURE OF MY WORK REQUIRING CONSTANT ACCESS TO MS OFFICE DOCUMENTS, MY LUMIA 920 IS VERY HANDY FOR VIEWING AND EDITING MS WORD, EXCEL AND POWERPOINT FILES, AS WELL AS READING PDFS.
      
      
      UNDERNEATH ITS HOOD, THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 HOUSES A DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR THAT WORKS IN TANDEM WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP. MULTITASKING AS WELL AS MEMORY INTENSIVE APPS PLAY OUT FLUIDLY WITH THE 1 GB RAM. FOR THE KIND OF DATA, MUSIC AND MOVIE COLLECTION I HAVE, ALONG WITH MY PHOTO ALBUMS, THIS PHONE?S 32 GB MEMORY HAS PROVED TO BE SUFFICIENT; EVEN THOUGH I CAN ALWAYS OPT FOR CLOUD STORAGE. WITH MY WORK TAKING ME ACROSS THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE COUNTRY, THE NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE APPS PROVE TO BE VERY USEFUL. I GET TO MY DESTINATIONS ALONG WITH TURN-BY-TURN DIRECTIONS; ALL THIS EVEN WHEN I AM NOT USING PACKET DATA OR 3G SERVICES. MY LUMIA 920 HELPS ME STAY CONNECTED WITH A VARIETY OF FEATURES, SUCH AS 3G, LTE, NFC, WLAN, WI-FI AND BLUETOOTH. A SMARTPHONE NEEDS TO BE CHARGED INEVITABLY. BUT, LONG GONE ARE THE DAYS OF ENSURING A CLOSE FIT BETWEEN THE CHARGER PLUG AND PHONE SOCKET. I JUST LAY MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 DOWN ON ITS CHARGING PAD AND IT STARTS JUICING UP POWER WIRELESSLY! I LOVE MY NOKIA LUMIA 920!"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"IT IS A BEAST. NO OTHER PHONE IN THE WORLD CAN COME CLOSE TO THIS. NOKIA HAS ALWAYS PROMISED AND DELIVERED THE BEST PRODUCT TO ITS CUSTOMERS. I HAVE BEEN USING NOKIA PHONES FROM THE PAST 7-8 YEARS AND EVERY YEAR THEY COME UP WITH SOMETHING SPECIAL.
      
      PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT IT BEING HEAVY. EVEN MY 3 YEAR OLD SISTER CAN CARRY IT THEN WHATS UP WITH YOU GUYSSS????...ITS A QUALITY PRODUCT AND BEST QUALITY COMES AT A BEST PRICE.
      
      
      4 STARS BECAUSE DIDN'T GET A WIRELESS CHARGING PLATE WITH THE PHONE.. :/"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"MY BEST BUD AND I WERE HAVING THIS HEATED DEBATE ABOUT WHICH SMARTPHONES RULE THE ROOST. IT WAS ESSENTIALLY IMPORTANT AS I WAS TO CHOOSE A SMARTPHONE FOR MYSELF PRETTY SOON. WITH ANDROIDS, IPHONES AND BLACKBERRYS SHOWN THE BACK DOOR, WE DECIDED THAT THE LUMIA 920 SURE DESERVES A CHANCE. IT WAS SURELY A RISK AS I WAS INVESTING MONEY, BUT I TRUSTED MY GUT AND THE LUMIA 920 HAS PROVED ME RIGHT! THIS PHONE IS A BEAUTY AND IT CATCHES YOUR EYE AND EARNS YOU YOUR FRIENDS? ENVY AS SOON AS YOU SLIP IT OUT OF ITS CASE. IT IS JUST SO SLEEK AND COMPACT, THAT YOU WOULDN?T WANT TO LET GO. I FOR ONE ALWAYS PREFER MUSCLE OVER LOOKS, BUT I HAVE MADE AN EXCEPTION WITH MY LUMIA 920. BUT, THAT DOESN?T MEAN THIS LITTLE BEAST DOES NOT PACK POWER. MY NOKIA SMARTPHONE COMES WITH A POWERFUL DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR COMBINED WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. IT RUNS HD GAMES, MOVIES, APPS AND WEB CONTENT WITH EXCEPTIONAL EASE. I CAN MULTITASK AND SWITCH BETWEEN MY WORKS EASILY, THANKS TO THIS PHONE?S SEAMLESS AND SMOOTH INTERFACE AND EASY NAVIGATION. THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM IS BY FAR THE BEST VISUALLY APPEALING OS I HAVE COME ACROSS; AND IT IS SO CONVENIENT TOO! I HAVE NOW ARRANGED ALL MY FAVOURITE AND FREQUENTLY USED APPS ON THE HOME SCREEN, SO THAT ALL I NEED TO DO IS TAP ON THE SCREEN, TO ACCESS THEM. WITH PEOPLE HUB, ALL MY FRIENDS? SOCIAL NETWORKING UPDATES ARE AUTOMATICALLY FED TO MY HOME SCREEN; NO MORE BORING LOG-INS AND PROFILE NAVIGATION. I AM BECOMING INCREASINGLY EFFICIENT AT COMPLETING MY OFFICE TASKS AS I CAN VIEW AND EDIT MS OFFICE DOCUMENTS ON MY LUMIA 920. THE 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY INTEGRATES PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY AND IS A JOY TO VIEW AND READ ON. IT SPORTS A SLIGHTLY CURVED DESIGN FOR ENHANCED READABILITY AT ANY VIEWING ANGLE. PROTECTED BY CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 TECHNOLOGY, THIS DISPLAY HAS SUSTAINED MY ABUSE QUITE WELL.
      
      
      I AM NOT MUCH OF A PHOTOGRAPHY BUFF, BUT I AM MIGHTY IMPRESSED BY THE 8.7 MP CAMERA ON MY LUMIA 920. IT COMES WITH CARL ZEISS TESSAR OPTICS AND INCORPORATES PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY FOR CRYSTAL CLEAR IMAGING. I CAN EVEN RECORD BLUR-FREE HD VIDEOS OF ALL MY FAVOURITE MOMENTS USING THIS CAMERA DUE TO ITS OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION FEATURE. THE FRONT 1.3 MP CAMERA IS PERFECT FOR MAKING VIDEO CALLS TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I DOWNLOAD AND STREAM MULTIMEDIA CONTENT AT HIGH SPEEDS FROM THE WEB AS MY PHONE SUPPORTS 3G AND LTE SERVICES. NFC IS A DREAM TO USE, WHILE THE WI-FI, WLAN AND BLUETOOTH FEATURES ON MY PHONE ARE EXTREMELY EFFICIENT AND CONVENIENT. DRIVING TO AND FROM WORK HAS BECOME HASSLE-FREE AS I CAN NOW LET MY PHONE?S NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE APPS POINT ME ONTO NEW ROADS WITH LESSER TRAFFIC."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"NOKIA LUMIA 920 HAS UPPED MY EXPECTATIONS FROM THE POPULAR BRAND. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A LOYAL NOKIA USER, BUT WHEN IT CAME TO SMARTPHONES I WASN?T SURE MY EXPECTATIONS WILL BE MET. GOOD THAT I MADE THE SWITCH, BECAUSE THIS PHONE HAS NOT ONLY MATCHED UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS BUT CERTAINLY EXCELLED. I?M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH ITS SLEEK BODY AND POLYCARBONATE DESIGN.  AT THE TOUCH OF A FINGER, APPS DANCE THROUGH AND PICTURES COME ALIVE ON ITS 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY WITH PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. THE 8.7 MP CAMERA OF THIS PHONE IS THE BIGGEST DELIGHT FOR ME. IT IS NOT JUST ANY OTHER CAMERA WITH REGULAR FEATURES. IT COMES WITH A STATE-OF-THE-ART CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS, WHICH CAPTURES IMAGES WITH PERFECTION AND INTEGRATES PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY ALONG WITH OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION. AT NIGHT I CAN TAKE PICTURES AS IF IT WERE THE DAY, THANKS TO THE CAMERA?S DUAL LED FLASH.  FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EXPERIENCED COMPLETE DESIGN EXCELLENCE AND GREAT LOOKS COMBINED TOGETHER. A PHONE THAT FITS MY POCKET AND JUSTIFIES EVERY PENNY SPENT ON IT. EVEN MY DAD WAS VERY HAPPY WITH MY DECISION TO BUY THIS PARTICULAR SMARTPHONE. THOUGH HE ISN?T VERY TECH-SAVVY, HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE PHONE WAS GREAT.
      
      I?M VERY IMPULSIVE AND IMPATIENT. I MEAN, WHO LIKES TO WAIT ALL THE TIME? MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 NEVER MAKES ME WAIT LONG. THANKS TO THE DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR THAT COMBINES WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. TOGETHER, THEY HELP ME ENJOY ALL THE APPS FASTER, BETTER. CONNECTIVITY COULDN?T GET BETTER! ALL MY WORK WORRIES OF STAYING CONNECTED WITH CLIENTS AND EXCHANGING DATA WHEN ON THE MOVE ARE GONE. MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 SUPPORTS NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION OR NFC, WI-FI, WLAN AND BLUETOOTH TOO. NOT JUST THAT, STAYING UPDATED WITH THE WORLD IS EXTREMELY EASY WITH THE 3G AND LTE SERVICES THAT ALLOW FASTER INTERNET STREAMING.  THE 32 GB STORAGE MEMORY ALLOWS ME TO STORE ALL MY FAVOURITE VIDEOS AND SONGS ALONG WITH OTHER IMPORTANT DATA.  MUSIC IS TRULY MY FIRST LOVE AND I SIMPLY ENJOY DOWNLOADING LATEST HITS. THE PHONE?S NOKIA MUSIC FEATURE TOTALLY DELIGHTS ME. WITH MIX RADIO, I CAN LISTEN TO A LARGE VARIETY OF SONGS AND SOOTHE MY MIND. THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 IS ONE FRIEND I LOVE TO TRAVEL WITH. I?M AN EXPLORER AT HEART AND WHENEVER I VISIT NEW PLACES, THE NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE APPS PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION. IT IS NOT LIKE MY DATA USAGE IS SHOOTING UP OR BATTERY IS GETTING DRAINED FAST. WHAT A SUPER COOL PHONE! IT GETS CHARGED IN NO TIME. WORKS EFFORTLESSLY, CHARGES WIRELESSLY. THIS IS WHAT I WOULD CALL A PHONE THAT IS CREATED TO DELIVER ONLY THE BEST-IN-CLASS. WITH SUCH CUTTING EDGE APPS AND MIND-BLOWING FEATURES IT HAS STOLEN MY HEART! WHENEVER SOME FRIEND COMES ALONG FOR ADVICE ON WHICH PHONE TO BUY, I SAY IT?S THE WONDERFUL NOKIA LUMIA 920."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"PLS HELP ME TO SOLVE MY DOUBT.....
      
      I THINK NOKIA WINDOWS PHONE DOESNOT PROVIDE MULTITASKING ON THIRD PARTY APPS...
      
      FOR EXAMPLE WE CANNOT OPEN SKYPE AND NIMBUZZ ON SAME TIME. AFTER OPENING NIMBUZZ, WE CAN OPEN SKYPE BUT IN THAT TIME NIMBUZZ IS GO TO OFLINE...HOW CAN SOLVE THIS ON WINDOWS  OS
      
      PLS HELP..."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"POSTING IN LIST FORMAT ABOUT FEATURES I CAN THINK OF.
      
      
      -PHONE  BUILD QUALITY- SUPERB (WAS THERE ANY DOUBT?). IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH THE SIZE, IT FEELS AWESOME.
      
      
      -CALL QUALITY- ALSO OUTSTANDING
      
      
      -USER INTERFACE- IT'S DIFFERENT, BUT NOTHING WORRYING, HAS A VERY SHORT LEARNING CURVE AND ONCE ONE GETS USED TO IT FEELS JUST AS GOOD AS ANY COMPETING PLATFORM. IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF PERSONAL CHOICE ON THIS ONE, AND IMO, IS NOT A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ASPECT, UNLESS IT'S OVERLY CUMBERSOME. WHAT IS GOOD THOUGH IS THE FLUIDITY OF THE UI IN ALL REGIONS. AGAIN, THAT'S NOTHING TO BOAST ABOUT NOW, BECAUSE COMPETING PLATFORMS ARE AT PAR TOO.
      
      
      -APPS- THE SITUATION IS NOT AS DIRE AS NAY- SAYERS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE US BELIEVE, BUT LET'S FACE IT, IT ISN'T EXACTLY BRIMMING WITH APPS EITHER. I SEE THIS AS A VERY TEMPORARY ISSUE THOUGH, BECAUSE WITH MSFT POURING MONEY INTO THE PLATFORM, THERE IS A NOTICEABLE FORWARD PUSH. THERE ARE ALL THE CORE APPS ONE COULD NEED AND PLENTY MORE ARE INCOMING. THE DOWN SIDE IS THE MARKET INTERFACE ITSELF. WHILE IT WORKS PERFECTLY AND IS INFORMATIVE ENOUGH,  A LITTLE MORE DATA, LIKE ON ANDROID WOULD BE GOOD, LIKE TOTAL NUMBER OF DOWNLOADS, VERSION RATING AND RATING FOR YOUR DEVICE. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, IT'S STILL DECENT AND NO WHERE NEAR AS BAD AS PEOPLE WHO GET EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN A COMPANY OR PRODUCT, BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT IT (DON'T WANT TO CALL THEM FANBOYS/ GIRLS) LIKE TO BELIEVE.
      
      
      -MULTITASKING- THIS IS THE ONE SEMI DOWNSIDE TO THIS PLATFORM. IT WORKS FOR CORE APPS, AND WP HAS HAD IT SINCE MANGO (WP7.5), BUT FOR SOME REASON A LOT OF DEVELOPERS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE USE OF IT. I CAN LIVE WITH IT, BUT I'M NOT REALLY PLEASED WITH IT AS IT IS. I'M ONLY HOPING THAT AT SOME STAGE, IT GETS PUSHED A LITTLE MORE TO AT LEAST IOS LEVELS.
      
      
      CAMERA- LOL, I WAS SAVING THIS FOR LAST, BUT THEN I REALISED THAT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT HAD TO BE SAID HAS BEEN SAID IN COUNTLESS REVIEWS ON THE WEB. TO SUM IT UP, AWESOME LOW LIGHT STILLS AND DAYLIGHT/ LOW LIGHT VIDEO, NOT SO OUTSTANDING, WHILE STILL DECENT, STILLS IN GOOD LIGHT. THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO ADD, IS THAT WHILE THE PORTICO UPDATE WAS SUPPOSED TO FIX THE BLUR, IT HASN'T COMPLETELY ACHIEVED ITS GOAL. CHECK DP REVIEWS ON THAT BECAUSE FOR PHOTOGRAPHY RELATED REVIEWS, THAT'S WHERE ONE GOES, AND NOT TO TECH SITES WHICH CARRY ON THEIR BRAND OF FANBOY JOURNALISM/ BLOGGING.
      
      
      OUTRIGHT NEGATIVE ASPECTS ARE
      
      -NO CORE TIME SUITE (COUNTDOWN TIMER/ STOPWATCH) APP, TIMERS SOMETIMES FAIL TO BUZZ IN THE BACKGROUND OR OUTRIGHT QUIT BECAUSE THE DEVELOPERS DIDN'T CODE PROPERLY. THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED THIS AS A STANDARD RUNNING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PHONE CLOCK.
      
      
      -VOLUME SETTINGS GET REVERTED TO STANDARD AFTER A REBOOT AND IF YOU FORGET TO PUSH IT UP/ DOWN, YOU HAVE A RINGER AT AN UNDESIRABLE SOUND LEVEL. (I HOPE THEY SEE THIS AS AN OBVIOUS FLAW AND FIX IT.)
      
      
      CAN'T REALLY THINK OF MUCH ELSE, AND TO SUMMARISE MY IMPRESSION, I REALLY LIKE THIS DEVICE AND AM HOPEFUL FOR THE PLATFORM. IT HAS A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS, BUT AT THIS STAGE IN IT'S LIFE, I THINK IT IS AHEAD OF WHERE THE COMPETITION WAS."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"PROS- EXCELLENT BATTERY LIFE( LASTS FOR 34HRS CONNECTED TO A WIFI NETWORK, MODERATE USE), BEST CAMERA ON A MORDERN SMARTPHONE, UNIQUE BUILD QUALITY, LIVE TILES ON WIN PHONE 8,NOKIA EXCLUSIVE APPS AND SERVICES,GOOD SOCIAL NETWORK INTEGRATION.
      
      CONS- LACK OF OPTIMIZED APPS AND GAMES.
      
      
      UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST INNOVATIVE SMART PHONE IN THE MARKET.
      
      EXCELLENT PEICE OF ENGINEERING."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"THE PHONE IS GREAT. BUT THE WINDOWS PHONE 8 OS HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO COMPETE WITH THE LIKES OF ANDROID, IOS. IT HAS IT'S LIMITATIONS LIKE NO WAY TO LOCK SCREEN ROTATION, NO QUICK SETTINGS, VERY LIMITED GOOD APPS(FREE) ETC"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW, THE WORD THAT COMES TO MY MIND IS REFRESHING, YES THIS PHONE WITH ALL ITS LOW POINTS MENTIONED BY OTHERS IS NOT THE BEST IN THE MARKET SPEC'S WISE BUT IT'S REALLY REFRESHING!, ALMOST A WEEK NOW AND STILL LOVE TO PLAY AROUND WITH THE HANDSET, IT MAKES YOU STAND OUT IN THE CROWD.
      
      
      WILL MENTIONED SOME OF THE POINTS WHICH ARE SOME HOW NOT ADMIRED THAT MUCH BUT ARE A GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY,
      
      
      NOKIA DRIVE AND NOKIA MAPS: USING IT FOR MY DAILY COMMUTATION..TURN BY TURN NAVIGATION,IT'S VERY ACCURATE AND FREE...NO DATA PLANS...NO SLOWNESS....EVERYTHING OFFLINE..CHOSE STATE(S) AND DOWNLOAD THE MAPS....NAVTECH IS OWNED BY NOKIA WITCH IS THE WORLD'S LEADING NAVIGATION SERVICE PROVIDER.
      
      
      NOKIA MUSIC:AMAZING WAST AND RICH COLLECTION OF SONGS BOTH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL WHICH YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FOR FREE ...SYNC IT TO YOUR PC ..THEY ARE DRM FREE...SO AUTHENTIC FILES AT YOUR FINGER TIPS
      
      
      WHY A 4/5:
      
      -BATTERY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPECIALLY UNDER WIFI USAGE IT DRAINS VERY QUICKLY
      
      -MOST OF THE ACCESSORIES ARE YET NOT AVAILABLE IN RETAIL....ALSO INCLUDING A WIRELESS CHARGING OUT OF BOX WOULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME..
      
      -CALL QUALITY IS NOT THE BEST OF THE LOT"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"THIS IS THE BEST WINDOWS PHONE YOU CAN GET AT THIS PRICE.

      THIS IS THE DRAWBACKS I FOUND MAY BE AT FUTURE UPDATE THIS CAN BE RESOLVED.BUT SERIOUSLY GUYS WHEN U BUY THIS PHONE U WILL FALL IN LOVE.IT ALSO WON 12 INTERNATIONAL AWARDS.SO GO FOR IT"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"THIS IS THE ERA OF SMARTPHONES AND THE LUMIA 920 LAUNCHED BY NOKIA SPORTS CLASSY DESIGN AND DELIVERS AN AWESOME PERFORMANCE. MY BEAUTIFUL PHONE HAS A UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN THAT IS A CLASS APART. I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY, AND LOVE THE SPECTACULAR 8.7 MP CAMERA THAT COMES WITH A CARL ZESIS TESSAR LENS. THIS CAMERA INCORPORATES PUREVIEW TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION THAT PROVIDES ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND BRIGHT PHOTOS. THE DUAL LED FLASH IS VERY POWERFUL AND IS PERFECT WHEN I WANT TO CLICK SNAPS IN THE DARK. I LOVE THE 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY THAT IS SO SLEEK AND RESPONSIVE DUE TO THE INTEGRATED PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. THE UNIQUE DESIGN OF THIS SCREEN OFFERS THE EASY READABILITY AND COMFORTABLE VIEWING BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH RESOLUTION.
      
      
      PEOPLE HUB ON MY PHONE IS SO HANDY THAT I GET ALL THE UPDATES OF MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES ON MY HOME SCREEN. I CAN EVEN READ AND EDIT MS OFFICE DOCUMENT ON MY SMARTPHONE AND VIEW PDF FILES WITH EASE. THE COMMON HASSLE OF A WIRED CHARGER IS ELIMINATED BY THE WIRELESS CHARGING FEATURE OF MY LUMIA 920."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"THIS IS THE FIRST WINDOWS 8, I HAVE MOVED TO AFTER USING ANDROID FOR LAST TWO YEARS AND FIND THE PLATFORM TO BE ROBUST AND OPTIMUM AMOUNT OF APPS AVAILABLE ON THE PLATFORM. ALTHOUGH ONE CANNOT COMPARE IT TO VARIETY OF APPS AVAILABLE IN GOOGLE PLAY THE APPS AVAILABLE SATISFY MY MODERATE REQUIREMENT OF SOCIAL, BUSINESS, GAMING AND COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENT FOR THE MOMENT. THE MAIN ADVANTAGE IS SEAMLESS SYNC WITH OFFICE OUTLOOK MAIL, CALENDAR, ONE NOTE, ETC.
      
      
      THE PHONE BUILD, GRIP, FINISH IS VERY GOOD. I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE SQUAR-ISH SIZE BEING USED TO LONGISH PHONES, BUT THE SHAPE HELPS IN BETTER HANDLING OF THE DEVICE WHILE TALKING OR ON SCREEN OPERATION. THE TOUCH FACTOR IS SMOOTH AND CONTROLLED (DOES NOT SLIP AND RUN AWAY LIKE OTHER PHONES) AND THE DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD AND TEXT LEGIBILITY IS VERY HIGH. HD VIDEOS PLAYS LIKE DREAM.
      
      
      GOOD PHONE, GO FOR IT"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"TO ALL THE PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF WHO USE ANDROID BASED PHONE TRY NOKIA LUMIA 920 AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT NOKIA IS UPTO. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH WITH JAM SAID. NOKIA HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE THE BEST HARDWARE WHEN IT COMES TO PHONE. HAD AN E72 WHICH WAS BOUGHT IN 2009 AND STILL STANDS STRONG.
      
      NOKIA MAPS ARE ANY GIVEN DAY BETTER THAN GOOGLE MAPS AND THE CITY LENS IN LUMIA IS SIMPLY AWESOME. HAVE BEEN USING A SAMSUNG GALAXY S2 FOR CLOSE TO 2 YEARS NOW AND I USED TO THINK SAMSUNG IS THE BEST BUT WHEN SAW LUMIA 920 (THANKS TO MY WIFE FOR BUYING THIS PHONE) I REALIZED I WAS LIVING IN SOME FOOL'S PARADISE.
      
      KUDOS TO NOKIA FOR FIGHTING ALL ODDS AND DELIVERING MASTER PIECE."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"TO BE FRANK, THIS IS THE BEST PHONE AVAILABLE IN MARKET WITH LOT OF INNOVATION AND STANDS HEALTHY IN FRONT OF APPLE AND SAMSUNG. IPHONE 5 IS NOTHING IN INNOVATION EXCEPT THE DESIGN. ON THE OTHER SIDE, SAMSUNG GIVES OUT A CHEAP HARDWARE WITH BEST MOBILE OS AVAILABLE IN MARKET. NOKIA TAKES WINDOWS OS WHICH IS FRESH BUT HASN'T MADE ANY IMPACT IN MOBILE OS. BUT UNDOUBTEDLY, IT GIVES THE BEST HARDWARE AND BUILD QUALITY. THE ADVANTAGE OF LUMIA 920 IS THAT ITS AVAILABLE IN INDIA WHERE EVERYONE LOVES NOKIA BUT THE DISADVANTAGE IS THAT ITS MUCH OVERPRICED FROM ITS COMPETITORS. IF LUMIA 920 IS PRICED NEAR 32,000 AND 820 AROUND 25000. THEN, IT CAN BE THE BEST SELLER SOON. I SHD HAVE RATED 5, BUT I HAVE MADE IT 4 BECOS OF ITS PRICE..."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"TO ME IT LACKED ONLY 2 FEATURES.....
      
      
      1.QUAD CORE BCZ PAYING 35K+ FOR DUAL CORE PROCESSOR IS A MESS.
      
      
      2.RAM MUST BE 2GB INSTEAD OF 1GB.....
      
      
      3.BATTERY MUST BE AROUND 2400MAH
      
      
      EVERY ONE ARE SAYING THAT WP8 REQUIRES LESS RAM AND CONSUMES LESS POWER AND DUAL CORE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH....BUT ???...
      
      
      EVERY OTHER FEATURES WHICH ARE NOT MENTIONED  ARE SUPERB ESPECIALLY WINDOWS 8..
      
      
      FOLKS LOOKING FOR RICH LOOKS &AMP; INNOVATIVE CAMERA CAN GO WITH AS IT HAD OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION..."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"WHEN I HEARD THAT NOKIA WAS PLANNING TO PORT MICROSOFT?S LATEST OS OFFERING TO ITS MOBILE DEVICES, I WAS HONESTLY A BIT SCEPTICAL. BUT ONCE I GOT A TASTE OF WHAT IT FELT LIKE, I JUST COULDN?T HOLD BACK. I GOT MYSELF THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 SMARTPHONE AND THE INTEGRATION OF THE RELIABILITY OF NOKIA WITH THE CONVENIENCE AND EASY ACCESSIBILITY OF WINDOWS 8 HAS LEFT ME IN AWE. THE ME TILES ARE SO INFORMATIVE AND CONVENIENT. I HAVE ORGANIZED ALL MY CONTACTS ON MY HOME SCREEN AND THE SECOND ANYONE POSTS AN UPDATE ON ANY SOCIAL NETWORK I HAVE IT ON MY SCREEN! THE SAME GOES FOR ME, AS I CAN POST MY UPDATE SIMULTANEOUSLY TO FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN AND TWITTER. WINDOWS PHONE 8 ALSO LETS ME VIEW AND EDIT MS OFFICE DOCUMENTS AND VIEW PDFS. THIS HELPS ME WORK WHILE I AM ON THE MOVE, IMPROVING MY PRODUCTIVITY. ON THE BUILD FRONT TOO, THIS PHONE SCORES VERY HIGH. ITS UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN IS SOPHISTICATION PERSONIFIED. HOUSED AT THE REAR OF THE PHONE IS THE 8.7 MP CAMERA THAT INTEGRATES A CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS. WHEN COUPLED WITH PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY, MY IMAGES COME OUT CLEAN WITH MINIMUM DISTORTION AND TRUE-TO-LIFE COLOURS. EVEN VIDEO RECORDING IS GREAT WITH OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION RADICALLY REDUCING MOTION BLUR. I CAN SHOOT VIDEOS AND CLICK SNAPS EVEN AT NIGHT DUE TO THE POWERFUL LED FLASH. I LOVE THE WAY THE 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY FEELS UNDERNEATH MY FINGERS WITH ITS SLIGHTLY CURVED DESIGN AND PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. IT MAKES TEXT MORE READABLE, ICONS AND IMAGES BRIGHTER AND VIVID, AND MAKES WATCHING MOVIES AND VIDEOS AN EXTREMELY IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE.
      
      BENEATH ITS STYLISH EXTERIOR, MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 COMES WITH A POWERFUL DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR. IN COMBINATION WITH THE ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP, IT LETS ME RUN MEMORY INTENSIVE APPLICATIONS AND GAMES WITH EASE. MULTITASKING IS GLITCH-FREE AND INSTANT DUE TO 1 GB RAM. I HAVE COMBINED THE 32 GB ON-BOARD MEMORY STORAGE AND A CLOUD DATA STORAGE SUBSCRIPTION FOR ALL MY DATA. THIS WAY, I HAVE AMPLE SPACE FOR MY MAIL INBOX, PHOTO ALBUMS, MUSIC AND MOVIE COLLECTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER DATA. I PERSONALLY LOVE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL AVAILABLE IN NOKIA MAPS AND THE TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATION PROVIDED BY NOKIA DRIVE. IT HELPS ME REACH MY DESTINATIONS ON TIME AND WITH MINIMUM EFFORT. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TO CONFIGURE MY LUMIA 920 TO POINT THE WAY AND IT LITERALLY DOES SO EVEN WITHOUT USING DATA! NOW THAT?S INCREDIBLE. I HAVE AN EVERGREEN LOVE FOR MUSIC AND LIKE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE LATEST TUNES TO HIT THE AIR. WITH THE NOKIA MUSIC STORE AND MIX RADIO, I CAN DOWNLOAD UMPTEEN SONGS TO MY LUMIA 920 AND LISTEN TO THEM ON RADIO TOO, AGAIN EVEN WITHOUT DATA USAGE. WITH SUPPORT FOR 3G, LTE, WI-FI, WLAN AND BLUETOOTH, THIS PHONE HAS PLENTY OF CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS. AND THE BEST PART IS, IT DOESN?T REQUIRE A WIRED CHARGER!"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS OF NOKIA LUMIA 920?S LAUNCH, I WAS EXCITED TO RESEARCH ABOUT IT. JUST DIDN?T KNOW THAT I WOULD LIKE IT SO MUCH, I WOULD END UP GETTING ONE FOR MYSELF! I LOVE THE BLUR-FREE PICTURE QUALITY THAT MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 PROVIDES WITH ITS 8.7 MP CAMERA FEATURING PUREVIEW TECHNOLOGY AND CARL ZEISS LENS. AND I CAN GO CLICKING EVEN IN A MOVING BUS AS ITS OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION FEATURE TAKES CARE OF THE SHAKES AND BUMPS AND PREVENTS THEM FROM MARRING THE SNAP. THE 4.5-INCH PUREMOTION HD+ DISPLAY MAKES CHATTING, BROWSING AND NAVIGATION FASTER. IT?S THE MOST SENSITIVE TOUCH SCREEN AND I CAN BROWSE IT EVEN WITH COVERED FINGERTIPS. DONNED WITH CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 PROTECTION, THE DISPLAY RESISTS SCRATCHES, FINGER PRINTS AND DAMAGE DUE TO ACCIDENTAL FALLS. SO MY PHONE LOOKS GOOD, NO MATTER HOW OLD IT REALLY GETS.
      
      
      I LOVE TO DISCOVER DIFFERENT CITIES AND FIND OUT WHICH ARE THE MOST EXCITING PLACES TO VISIT AND MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 HELPS ME IN THAT WITH ITS HERE CITY LENS, HERE MAPS, HERE DRIVE AND HERE TRANSIT FUNCTION. ITS VIEWFINDER REVEALS ALL THE NEARBY EATERIES, SHOPPING MALLS, MOVIE THEATRES ALONG WITH PHOTOS, SO I CAN SPEND MORE TIME HAVING FUN, INSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR A PLACE TO DO SO. I CAN EASILY SHARE MY FAVOURITE PLACES WITH MY BUDDIES OR SAVE THEM FOR MY FUTURE VISITS. LOOKS MATTER TO ME, AND I HAVE NOTICED HOW OTHERS TRY TO STEAL A GLANCE AT MY PHONE?S SLEEK, UBER COOL UNIBODY CONSTRUCTION. IT?S SUCH A RELIEF THAT I DON?T HAVE TO CARRY A WIRED CHARGER TO CHARGE MY PHONE WHEN LOW ON ENERGY. I JUST HAVE TO PLACE MY PHONE ON THE WIRELESS CHARGING PAD AND IT GETS COMPLETELY CHARGED.
      
      
      POWERED BY THE QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR AND 1 GB RAM, MY PHONE MAKES ME WAIT LESSER AND DO MORE AT A FASTER SPEED. THE 32 GB ONBOARD STORAGE AND SKYDRIVE FREE CLOUD STORAGE OF 7 GB IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR MY DATA STORAGE. I CAN QUICKLY GLANCE THROUGH ALL MY IMPORTANT APPS THROUGH THE ME TILES INTERFACED WINDOWS 8 ON MY PHONE LIKE FACEBOOK, TWITTER, PEOPLEHUB, YAHOO MAIL AND MANY MORE. BUSINESS APPS TOO ARE AVAILABLE, FOR INSTANCE ADOBE ACROBAT READER, MS OFFICE WITH WORD, EXCEL AND POWERPOINT. SO, ANY URGENT WORK-RELATED CHORE CAN NOW BE TAKEN CARE OF WITHOUT ME HAVING TO SWITCH ON MY PC.
      
      
      I CAN?T GO A DAY WITHOUT LISTENING TO MUSIC AND MY PHONE?S NOKIA MUSIC HELPS ME STREAM NUMEROUS LATEST TRACKS, MAKE A PERSONAL ALBUM OF MY FAVOURITE ARTISTS, AND EVEN CREATE MY OWN MUSIC CHANNELS. THE 3G, LTE, NFC, WI-FI AND BLUETOOTH FEATURES MAKE MY LIFE EASIER. I RECENTLY HEARD THAT NOKIA LUMIA 920 WON THE READER?S CHOICE SMARTPHONE OF THE YEAR IN THE ENGADGET AWARDS 2012 AND I TOTALLY SECOND THE DECISION."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"WHENEVER I BUY ELECTRONIC ITEMS OR PHONES I ALWAYS SEARCH THE WEB. I READ UP INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCTS AND CHECK THE REVIEWS. THEY CERTAINLY HELP! WHEN I MADE MY DECISION TO BUY THE NEW NOKIA LUMIA 920 IT WAS BASED ON MY RESEARCH AND THE POSITIVE REVIEWS I HAD READ ABOUT THIS SMARTPHONE. TODAY, I CAN SAY THAT I?M PROUD OF MY CHOICE. ITS 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY IS SUPER RESPONSIVE TO TOUCH MAKING EVERY MOVE SWIFT AND APPLICATIONS ENJOYABLE. THE PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY ENABLES A SMOOTH TOUCHSCREEN EXPERIENCE THAT LEAVES YOU ASTOUNDED. WHILE VIEWING HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGES IT IS NOT LIKE MY EYES BURN AFTER SOME TIME. I ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE TOTALLY. I AM A CARELESS MOBILE USER AND HONESTLY I WAS SCARED TO BUY A SMARTPHONE FOR THE SAME REASON. I DON?T HAVE THOSE WORRIES NOW BECAUSE THE NOKIA LUMIA 920?S TOUCHSCREEN IS PROTECTED BY THE CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2. THE WINDOWS PHONE 8 OPERATING SYSTEM IS SO COOL. IT FEELS AS IF CHARACTERS, APPS AND GAMES COME ALIVE! I CAN UPDATE LIVE TILES AND HAVE THE UPDATES FROM MY FRIENDS ON MY HOMESCREEN WITH PEOPLE HUB. MY FRIENDS WONDER HOW I CAN CONSTANTLY KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEM WHEREVER I GO AND I TELL THEM IT IS BECAUSE OF MY NEW PHONE!
      
      THE OTHER DAY I COMPLETED MY COLLEGE ASSIGNMENT ON MY LUMIA 920! HOW AMAZING IS THAT! IT WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE READING AND EDITING MS OFFICE DOCUMENTS ON MY SMARTPHONE AND VIEWING PDF FILES IS EASY. ACTUALLY EVERYTHING I NEED IS ON MY HOMESCREEN AND I DON?T HAVE TO HUNT FOR APPS. ON MY EARLIER PHONE, I USED TO WAIT FOR 5 MINUTES FOR APPS TO LOAD! NOT ON THE LUMIA 920, THANKS TO THE DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR THAT COMBINES WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. NO GLITCHES AT ALL TILL NOW! I HAVE RECENTLY STARTED CLICKING PICTURES A LOT. THE INSPIRATION COMES FROM MY PHONE?S 8.7 MP CAMERA WITH A STATE-OF-THE-ART CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS. THE PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION ENSURE BLUR REDUCTION AND THE RESULT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR IMAGE! WHEN I CLICK PICTURES IN THE NIGHT, IT IS LIKE THE PICTURES CLICKED DURING THE DAY. THE DUAL LED FLASH IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL AND LIGHTS UP EVERY CORNER OF THE NIGHT. THE TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATION HELPS A LOT IN FINDING ADDRESSES. NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE APPS ARE THE BEST FEATURES OF ALL NOKIA SMARTPHONES. MY FAVOURITE MUSIC FOLLOWS ME WHEREVER I GO AS I CAN STORE LOADS OF SONGS AND VIDEOS ON THE 32 GB MEMORY. I DOWNLOAD ALL THE LATEST SONGS FROM NOKIA MUSIC STORE AND MIX RADIO. SURFING THE WEB WITHOUT INTERRUPTION IS EASILY POSSIBLE ON MY NOKIA LUMIA 920. MY PHONE SUPPORTS 3G AND LTE SERVICES ALONG WITH NFS, WI-FI, WLAN AND BLUETOOTH. I LOVE NOKIA FOR ITS AWESOME BATTERY THAT DOES NOT GO DOWN FAST, UNLIKE OTHER SMARTPHONES."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"WITH ALL THE BUZZ THAT SAMSUNG, APPLE AND OTHER BRANDS CREATED ABOUT THEIR SMARTPHONES, NOKIA WAS SOMEHOW RELEGATED TO A CORNER. BUT, WITH THE ENTRY OF THE LUMIA RANGE OF SMARTPHONES, NOKIA ESTABLISHED ITS FIRM REIGN OVER THE SMARTPHONE MARKET. AND, WITH ITS FLAGSHIP DEVICE ? THE NOKIA 920, IT HAS LAUNCHED THE BIG DADDY OF ALL SMARTPHONES. MY LUMIA 920 LORDS OVER COMPETITIVE DEVICES WITH A SET OF ENVIABLE AND UNPARALLELED FEATURES. THE DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR, 1 GB RAM AND THE ADRENO 225 GPU PUMP OUT A PULSATING PERFORMANCE. ADD 32 GB OF ONBOARD MEMORY WITH SKYDRIVE STORAGE SUPPORT, AND I DON?T NEED TO LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE FOR STORING ALL MY DATA.
      
      
      THE 8.7 MP SHOOTER ON MY LUMIA 920 BEATS ALL COMPETITION HANDS DOWN, WITH ITS CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS AND PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY. IT COMES WITH AN AMAZING SET OF DIGITAL LENSES, SUCH AS SMART SHOOT THAT LETS ME COMPOSE PERFECT SNAPS, AND RECORD AWESOME VIDEOS. I AM GLAD THAT NOKIA CHOSE THE WINDOWS PHONE 8 AS THE OPERATING SYSTEM FOR MY LUMIA 920, AS IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ANDROIDS AND IOSS. I AM SATISFIED WITH MY CHOICE!"
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"WITH THE WIDE VARIETY OF SMARTPHONES THAT HAVE STORMED THE MARKET, I WAS FEARFUL THAT MY FAVOURITE BRAND; NOKIA, WOULD BE LEFT BEHIND SOMEWHERE IN THE WAKE. BUT, AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE, RELIABILITY AND GENIUS CRAFTSMANSHIP TAKE PRIME POSITION AND THIS IS WHAT NOKIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN FOR. WHEN I CAME TO KNOW THAT NOKIA HAD LAUNCHED THE LUMIA 920 AS ITS PREMIER AND FLAGSHIP SMARTPHONE, I IMMEDIATELY BOUGHT IT. THE FEATURES OF THIS PHONE HAVE LEFT ME BEDAZZLED. I HAVE BEEN SWOONING OVER THE SLEEK UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE DESIGN AND AM VERY HAPPY AT THE ENVIOUS LOOKS I GET EVERY TIME I TAKE MY PHONE OUT IN PUBLIC. WITH AN 8.7 MP CAMERA THAT FEATURES THE LEGENDARY CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS, I CAN CLICK AWESOME SNAPS OF ALL MY FAVOURITE MOMENTS. ALONG WITH THE INTEGRATED PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY, MY LUMIA 920 ALSO FEATURES OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION THAT HELPS ME RECORD BLUR-FREE VIDEOS. SO BE IT THE BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES OR A STUNNING MONUMENT THAT I RECORD FROM A MOVING CAR, THE VIDEO COMES OUT PERFECT. I CAN EVEN CAPTURE EVERY DETAIL AT NIGHT WITH THE DUAL LED FLASH. BEING A SOMEWHAT CLUMSY USER, I WAS A BIT SCARED ABOUT THE LARGE 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY OF MY LUMIA 920. BUT, THIS DISPLAY COMES WITH CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 TECHNOLOGY THAT PROTECTS IT FROM SCRATCHES. INTEGRATING THE PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY, EVERY VISUAL FLOWS SEAMLESSLY AND IN A FLUID MANNER. GAMES, MOVIES, WEB PAGES AND DOCUMENTS ARE RENDERED PERFECTLY. I LOVE THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM THAT COMES WITH THE VERY CONVENIENT LIVE TILES FEATURE. MY FAVOURITE APPS AND GAMES ARE LOCATED RIGHT ON MY HOME SCREEN OFFERING EASY ACCESS. MS OFFICE DOCUMENTS ARE EASY TO VIEW AND EDIT ON MY LUMIA 920.
      
      I WAS THOROUGHLY SURPRISED BY THE EASE WITH WHICH I COULD MULTITASK OR PLAY GAMES ON MY PHONE. WHEN I REFERRED TO THE MANUAL, I FOUND THE SOURCE OF THIS POWER. THE NOKIA LUMIA 920 INTEGRATES A DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR COMBINED WITH AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. STORING ALL MY DATA INCLUDING MY FAVOURITE MOVIES, SOUNDTRACKS AND WORK-RELATED DATA IS EASY WITH THE 32 GB ON-BOARD STORAGE MEMORY. I HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO SKYDRIVE FOR MY EXTRA STORAGE NEEDS. MY FIANC IS IN LOVE WITH THE NOKIA MAPS AND NOKIA DRIVE APPS ON MY PHONE. THESE APPS HELP US REACH ALL OUR DESTINATIONS ON TIME AND WITHOUT GETTING LOST, AS THEY OFFER TURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS. AND, I DON?T EVEN NEED DATA USAGE FOR THAT. MY MUSIC COLLECTION IS ENVIOUSLY LARGE THANKS TO THE NOKIA MUSIC APP. MIX RADIO IS PERFECT FOR LISTENING TO TRACKS ON THE GO. I NOW ACCESS THE WEB ON THE MOVE AND CAN STREAM MULTIMEDIA CONTENT AT HIGH SPEEDS AS MY LUMIA 920 SUPPORTS 3G AND LTE SERVICES. I CAN TRANSFER DATA USING NFC AND BLUETOOTH AS WELL AS ACCESS THE WEB USING WI-FI."
Nokia Lumia 920,4,"YOUR FIRST REACTION HOLDING THIS DEVICE IS TO HIT SOMEONE HARD WITH IT. TAKING IT IN HAND MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE THAT SOMETHING SOLID BUILT IS FINALLY HERE, NOT LIIKE FEATHERTOUCH STUFF GOING AROUND. I HAD HTC MOZART EARLIER AND KNOW HOW FLAKY IT WAS.
      
      
      NOW FOR THE MOST AMZING THING THAT WILL KILL FLYTE. AT LEAST FOR ME. NOKIA MUSIC APP IS AWESOME. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MOST FO TEH NEW SONGS HERE FOR FREE AND AT 256 KBPS. MOST OF THE TORENT STUFF GOING AROUND IS ONLY 128 KBPS ENCODING. AND COLLECTION IS AMAZING. ONLY THING MISSING IS THE GOOD QUALITY TAGGING IN THE MP3 FILES. ALL CRAPPY TAGGING FROM WEB CREEPS IN WITH WEBSITE NAMES ETC AND MOVIE NAMES AS ARTISTS.
      
      
      IN LAST 3 DAYS, I HAVE CHANGED MY HOME SCREEN 5 TIMES AND STILL NOT SATISFIED ;-)
      
      HEADPHONE UNIT CAN CUT TH NOISE FULLY.
      
      
      BLUETOOTH IS NOT BEHAVING LIKE MY MOZART USED TO. MOZART USED TO TAKE BLUETOOTH TO LOW ENERGY MODE OR WOULD TURN IT OFF WHEN I WOULD EXIT CAR. ONCE I ENTER THE CAR AND TURN ON IGNITION, BT WILL AGAIN TURN ON FULLA ND CONNECT TO CAR. I AM MISSING THAT.
      
      
      GETTING THE MICROSIM, BELT POUCH AND SCREEN GUARD FOR THIS WILL BE BIT TRICKY.
      
      
      PHOTO QUALITY LOOKS DECENT. NOKIA PANAROMA AND PHOTOBEAMER ARE AWESOME THING. I HAVE NOT YET TRIED NIGHT POHOTGRAPHY.
      
      
      MOZART CABLE IS ALSO ABLE TO CHARGE IT, SO THATS GOOD. ITS 3 PIN CHARGER IS GOING TO GIVE TROUBLE. CHARGING PLATE SEEMS TO BE WAY COSTLY.
      
      
      VOICE CONTROL ON THE RIGHT SIDE CAN BE TROUBLE WHEN TAKING CALL. AS USUAL LIKE OTHER WINDOWS PHONES, IT CAN GET TURNED OFF WHEN DIALING DUE TO SLIDING SCREEN FOR TURN OFF. KEYS ARE OTHERWISE GOOD.
      
      
      SOUND QUALITY IN HEADPHONE AS WELL AS NORMAL COUKLD HAVE BEEN BETTER. IT WIOLL TAKE A WHILE TO GET USED TO THE SOUND DURING CALL.
      
      
      OVERALL GOOD, BUT SOME MORE IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE DONE."
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART, LIKE ALWAYS FLIPKART'S DELIVERY IS AWESOME, THEY DELIVERED IT IN FLAT TWO DAYS.
      
      
      NOW ABOUT THE PHONE, IF YOU ASK ME, I MADE A MISTAKE BUYING IT.
      
      
      CONS
      
      
      1) THE PHONE HANGS SOMETIMES AND THERE IS NO OPTION OTHER THAN DOING A COLD SHUTDOWN BY PRESSING THE VOLUME KEY DOWN AND THE POWER BUTTON.
      
      
      2) THE VOLUME SOMETIMES, STICKS AT 1/30 WHILE PLAYING MUSIC. EVEN IF YOU INCREASE THE VOLUME TO 30/30 NOTHING HAPPENS, THE VOLUME LEVEL STILL REMAINS THERE. YOU HAVE TO RESTART THE PHONE TO MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL AGAIN, THIS ONLY HAPPENS WITH THE MUSIC PLAYER THOUGH, NOT WITH THE VIDEO PLAYER AND NOR WITH THE NOKIA MUSIC PLAYER
      
      
      3) THE BATTERY BACKUP IS NOT GOOD, I DONT HAVE 3G, BUT I USE H (HSPDA) INSTEAD OF E (EDGE) MOSTLY, BECAUSE ITS FASTER, BUT THEN EVEN IF YOU DONT USE IT MUCH, AND ONLY FACEBOOK AND TWITTER ARE CONNECTED, AS I HAVE ADDED THEM TO THE ONLINE ACCOUNTS, THE BATTERY DRAINS REALLY VERY FAST, I WOULD EXPECT A PHONE LIKE THIS THIS TO ATLEAST LAST FOR A DAY(16 HOURS) BUT IT DOESNT.
      
      
      4) THE ""OTHERS"" FOLDER IS JUST SO ANNOYING, TRANSFER SOMETHING USING BLUETOOTH AND IF YOUR PHONE DOESNT LIKE IT, IT WILL SEND IT TO THE ""OTHERS"" FOLDER AND THERE YOU ARE, LOST YOUR VALUABLE SPACE, YOU CANT GET IT BACK TILL YOU DO A PHONE RESET.
      
      
      5) NO FILE MANAGER MAKES LIFE REALLY DIFFICULT, LIKE REALLY REALLY.
      
      
      6) OH YEAH! THE FLASH HAS STOPPED WORKING, I GOOGLED IT A BIT AND MOSTLY ON NOKIA FORUMS AND OTHER FORUMS I FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE, I MEAN COMMON ISSUE WITH SUCH EXPENSIVE HARDWARE?
      
      
      7) ONE NOTE, YOU CAN MAKE NOTES, BUT CANT DELETE THEM? MAYBE YOU CAN OR I AM JUST TOO DUMB TO FIND A WAY TO DELETE THEM. I DON'T KNOW, WELL.
      
      
      8) THE NIGHTMODE IN THE CAMERA IS GOOD, BUT YOU NEED A PAIR OF VERY GOOD HANDS, WHICH DONT SHAKE EVEN A BIT, WHICH MEANS, IF YOU ARE SITTING SOMEWHERE, THE PHOTOS IN NIGHT WILL COME OUT VERY GOOD, BUT IF YOU ARE STANDING AND DONT HAVE VERY STEADY HANDS, FORGET THE NIGHT MODE.
      
      
      9) I WOULD HAVE WANTED A XENON FLASH, THOUGH WELL THE DUAL LED FLASH IS NOT THAT BAD, BUT NOT THAT GOOD EITHER, OH WELL, THE FLASH HAS STOPPED WORKING ANYWAYS, WITHIN LIKE 3 WEEKS OR SO
      
      
      10) THE SITUATION OF APPS IS NOT THAT GOOD, YEAH THE BUNDLED NOKIA APPS ARE GOOD, BUT THE ONES MADE MY MICROSOFT LIKE FACEBOOK. THEY ARE A #FAIL, I JUST PREFER TO USE THE INTERNET EXPLORER FOR FACEBOOK
      
      
      11) THE PHONE IS HEAVY, LITERALLY VERY HEAVY, IF YOU USE IT TOO MUCH, YOU ARE BOUND TO GET A WRIST PAIN, LIKE I DID.
      
      
      12) THERE IS NO SCREEN ROTATION CONTROL, WHAT IF I DONT WANT THE SCREEN TO ROTATE? WELL THIS FEATURE MIGHT BE ADDED IN A FEW MONTHS(LETS JUST HOPE SO)
      
      
      PROS
      
      
      1) THE PHONE IS BUILT LIKE A TANK, DO A DROP TEST, NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR PHONE AS COMPARED TO ANY OTHER PHONE, THIS IS REALLY BUILT VERY GOOD.
      
      
      2) VIDEO RECORDING IS FLAWLESS, ON 1080P TAKE A VIDEO SITTING IN A MOVING CAR, THE VIDEO IS NOT AT ALL BLURRY, TAKES VERY GOOD VIDEOS IN PROPER LIGHT.
      
      
      3) THE DISPLAY IS GOOD, READABILITY IN SUN LIGHT IS GOOD.
      
      
      4) WINDOWS OS ISNT MATURE LIKE ANDROID, BUT IT FEELS SLICK AND FAST, THE HOME SCREEN IS AWESOME WITH LIVE TILES FOR VARIOUS APPS.
      
      
      5) THE INTERNET IS VERY FAST EVEN ON 2G, YOU CAN WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS WITHOUT THE BUFFER LAG.
      
      
      6) BUNDLED INTERNET EXPLORER IS VERY GOOD, YOU WONT MISS OPERA OR ANY OTHER BROWSER AT ALL, IF YOU ARE USING IT. TRUE ITS NOT THAT FAST LIKE OPERA, BUT ITS JUST AS GOOD"
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"BRILLIANT PHONE. HEAVY ON THE WALLET AND HEAVIER IN THE POCKET BUT STILL GOOD. I'D RECOMMEND LUMIAS OVER AN IPHONE ANYDAY BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT A WHOLE NEW WAY OF USING SMARTPHONES.
      
      P.S IVE BEEN NOTICING A LOT OF LONG FAKE REVIEWS BY PRESUMABLY FAKE PEOPLE ON THE LUMIAS. THEY'RE LIKE ESSAYS WRITTEN BY A 10 YEAR OLD.
      
      WHY IS NOKIA BEING SO CHEAP?
      
      JEEZ NOKIA GET A LIFE."
Nokia Lumia 920,3,CANT EVEN USE WHATS APP FOR A COMPLETE DAY........GETS HEATED A LOT WHILE CHARGING AND SOMETIMES WHILE PLAYING GAMES BUT THAT'S MANAGEABLE..... THE ISSUE IS THAT THE BATTERY LIFE SUCKS.... BIG TIME......CANT BELIEVE THE ENDURANCE RATING ON GSMARENA.COM......
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"DEAR READERS,
      
      
      RECENTLY I PURCHASED THIS PHONE FROM CROMA.I LOVE ITS UNIBODY TANK-LIKE BUILD AND SEAMLESS WP8 OS RUNNING ON IT. HOWEVER, THINGS GOT WORSE WHEN I STARTED USING MY PHONE.
      
      1) THE SCREEN FLICKERED PERSISTENTLY, ALMOST MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO READ ANYTHING ON IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS DUE TO SENSOR ADJUSTING TO NATURAL LIGHT BUT IT DIDN'T  HELP IN SPITE CHANGING BRIGHTNESS TO LOW FROM AUTOMATIC.
      
      
      2) THE PHONE ON ITS FIRST CHARGE ITSELF OVER HEATED AND DISCHARGED AT A RATE MORE THAN IT COULD CHARGE. ON DAY ONE I CHARGED MY PHONE THRICE WITH EACH CHARGE LASTING FOR 4- 5 HRS APPX.
      
      
      UPON THESE ISSUES I CHECKED ACROSS FORUMS AND FOUND THAT ITS A GENUINE MFG DEFECT WITH THE SCREENS OF LUMNIA 920. THE RETAILER MIGHT SAY THAT IT WOULD BE CORRECTED WITH SOFTWARE UPDATE, BEWARE ITS A SERIOUS ISSUE AMONG OTHER LUMIA USERS IN EUROPE AND US AND HAVE GOT THEIR UNITS REPLACED.
      
      
      SO I TOOK MY NEW LUMIA 920 BACK TO CROMA AND HANDED OVER IT TO THEM AND ASKED FOR REPLACEMENT. FORTUNATELY THEY TOO ACKNOWLEDGED THE DEFECT AND GAVE ME REPLACEMENT.
      
      
      MINE IS FEB 2013 MFG AND IMPORTED MADE IN CHINA.
      
      
      MY REPLACED LUMNIA 920 HAS SO FAR HASN'T GIVEN ANY OF THE ABOVE PROBLEMS AS YET. SCREEN LOOKS AMAZING AND BATTERY LASTS JUST OVER A DAY.
      
      
      I THINK ITS THE BEST SMART PHONE ON THE MARKET FOR ENTERPRISE USERS AND WOULDN'T HESITATE TO RECOMMEND EXCEPT FOR THOSE DEFECTIVE PIECES DOING ROUNDS IN THE WAREHOUSES ACROSS THE GLOBE."
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"EVERYONE IS ASKING AND DISCUSSING ABOUT THAT WHY NOKIA IS NOT CONNECTING WITH ANDROID EXCEPT
      
      THESE SHIT THINGS LIKE SYMBIAN AND WINDOWS OS. THIS MOBILE PHONE IS SMART BUT NOT EFFECT GIVING EXPERIENCES COME FROM THIS. SAMSUNG IS THE KING !!!"
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"GOT MY NOKIA LUMIA 920... AND I HAVE A FEW BOUQETS AND BRICKBATS FOR NOKIA/MICROSOFT GUYS.
      
      
      I AM ABSOLUTELY IMPRESSED WITH THE EMAIL INTERFACE, INCREASED CHOICE OF APPS IN THE APP STORE, THE PROCESSING SPEED, SOCIAL NETWORK INTEGRATION, CAMERA OPTIONS, LOCK SCREEN OPTIONS, SKYDRIVE, SCREEN THEME COLOR OPTIONS ETC.
      
      
      HOWEVER, I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE POOR OPTIONS FOR CONTACT SYNC, VERY POOR RESOLUTION OF SATELLITE MAPS FOR INDIA, HIGH SENSITIVITY OF THE PROXIMITY SENSOR, LACK OF SCREEN ORIENTATION LOCK, LACK OF OPTIONS TO ORGANIZE THE APPS IN TO FOLDERS/GROUPS, LACK OF ABILITY TO DATA SYNC WITH MY LAPTOP OVER WIFI, AND LACK OF TRUE MULTI TASKING (DOWNLOADING MAPS STOPS IF YOU OPEN ANOTHER APP!), AND OF COURSE POOR BATTERY LIFE!
      
      
      I HOPE SOMEONE OUT THERE FROM NOKIA/MICROSOFT IS LISTENING!!"
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON SATURDAY..FROM A NPD .
      
      
      THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE OF THIS PHONE IS THE HEATING UP WHEN USE WIFI N UPDATING APPS, CITY LENS -THE UPPER PART HEATS UP LIKE HELL, NOKIA MUSIC AGAIN HEATS UP... WHILE CHARGING IF I USE WIFI ITS HEATING UP.... DO WE BUY A 37K PHONE JUST TO KEEP EVERYTHING OFF..SO THAT IT STAYS COOOL... GOING FOR A REPLACEMENT TOMORROW....
      
      OTHERWISE A GOOD PHONE...BUT THE OS IS SO DISPPOINTING ..FEEL LIKE I WENT INTO PAST..."
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING NOKIA LUMIA 920 FROM 1 MONTH...ITS A GOOD PHONE.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. BEAUTIFUL SET AND HANDY DESIGN.
      
      2. NICE CAMERA CLARITY WHEN WE COMPARE TO SAMSUNG SMARTPHONES, SPECIALLY IN LOW LIGHT.
      
      3. NICE SURROUND SOUND.
      
      4. FEATHER TOUCH.
      
      5. BEAUTIFUL LIVE TILES.
      
      6. CHOICE OF VARIOUS CAMERA MODES, YOU CAN SELECT FROM.
      
      7. FAST PROCESSING SPEED.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. YOU CAN'T SET WALLPAPER OR BACKGROUND AS IN I PHONE.
      
      2. BATTERY LIFE IS NOT SO GOOD.
      
      3. LITTLE HEAVY IN WEIGHT.
      
      4. MUSIC AND RINGTONE VOLUME ARE DIRECTLY CONNECTED. WHEN YOU DECREASE YOUR VOLUME FOR MUSIC, RINGTONE VOLUME AUTOMATICALLY DECREASES.
      
      5. MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS ARE PAID, SUCH AS ANGRY BIRDS, ETC. WHICH ARE FREE IN ANDROID.
      
      
      AFTER 1 MONTH OF USAGE, I AM AGAIN BACK TO ANDROID WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY S3."
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"I HAVE SEEN SOME SPIRITED ARGUMENTS FROM THE FANS OF ANDROIDS, IOSS, APPLES, NOKIAS AND SAMSUNGS ON THIS PAGE SINCE I AM ALSO ONE WHO ASPIRED TO OWN THIS AMAZING PIECE OF HARDWARE ASSEMBLED BY NOKIA. HOWEVER ON SOME SERIOUS CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE TIMING OF RELEASE THIS PRODUCT HAS RECEIVED FOR INDIA, I FEEL NOKIA HAS PROVIDED TOO LITTLE TOO LATE FOR THE INDIAN CUSTOMERS IN PARTICULAR, THIS PRODUCT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RUNAWAY HIT IF IT WAS RELEASED 4-6 MONTHS PRIOR.
      
      
      THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT SONY HAS INFORMED ABOUT THE LAUNCH OF XPERIA Z WITH FULL HD SCREEN AT RECENTLY CONCLUDED CES 13,  HTCS BUTTERFLY WITH FULL HD SCREEN WILL ALSO B AVAILABLE SOON. I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT OTHER SPECS AS THEY WILL B UP TO DATE WITH THE MARKET.
      
      
      BEING ONE OF THE MANY INDIANS NOT HAVING THE LUXURY OF UPGRADING SMARTPHONES EVERY TIME A NEW DEVICE IS LAUNCHED, MY INTENTION IS TO STAY PUT TILL ALL MANUFACTURERS PIT THERE NEW DEVICES FOR 2013 AND THEN GO FOR THE BEST IN TERMS OF A. BUILD QUALITY AND B. FUNCTIONALITY.
      
      
      FOR THE LUMIA 920, IT IS A AMAZING AND STUNNING LOOKING DEVICE WHICH CAN GIVE I DEVICES A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. THE BUNDLED NAVIGATION SOFTWARE OF NOKIA WHICH IS FREE FOR GODS SAKE WILL NOT BE MATCHED IN NEAR FUTURE BY ANY MANUFACTURER. I HAVE BEEN USING NOKIA E72 AND FIND THE GPS LOCKING IN TO SATELLITES WITHIN 30 SECONDS OF STARTING THE APP. I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS EFFORTLESS FUNCTIONING IN ANY DEVICE TILL DATE. I HOPE THAT NOKIA TOO IS WORKING ON THE NEXT LUMIA AND HOPE IT RELEASES THE DEVICE WITH THE DEMAND STILL EXISTING."
Nokia Lumia 920,3,I PURCHASED MY LUMIA ON 14 JUNE ITS OVER ALL AWSM CELL PHONE BUT THE MAIN ISSUE IS BATTERY N AFTER SAME USAGE OF GAMES N NET DATA PACK ITS HEATING UP..SO IF U GO WITH IT PLZ CHECK IT OUT..OK GUD LUCK..
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"JAM NEEDS A REALITY CHECK ON HIS REVIEW
      
      CRITICISING IS ONE THING AND BLINDLY FOLLOWING IS ANOTHER!!
      
      
      1. LUMIA 920 IS HEAVY
      
      U CANT COMPARE IT WITH NOTE II
      
      FIRST FOR ITS SIZE ITS WAY TO HEAVIER
      
      NOTHING CAN JUSTIFY THAT.
      
      
      2.GAMES AND APPS MAKING WAVES IN ANDROID WILL SOON COME TO WINDOWS.
      
      BUT SAYING THAT THEY WILL WORK BEST IN WINDOWS IS MERE IGNORANCE AND BLIND BELIEVING.
      
      
      3. FOR THE PRICE ITS AVAILABLE IT STILL GIVES ITS CUSTOMERS A MERE DUAL CORE.
      
      FOR THIS PRICE OTHER CAPABLE DEVICES ARE GIVING QUAD CORE
      
      
      4. THEN THERE IS CHINMAY NAIK SAYING SIII CANT EVEN TOUCH LUMIA. HE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT LEVEL OF SIII IS WAY ABOVE THE LUMIAS. EASE OF USE, AWESOME FEATURES, PROCESSOR SPECS ARE SOMETHING IN WHICH LUMIA IS NOWHERE NEAR SIII.
      
      
      5. NXT THING IS ZUNE MAKING PPL MORE CHAINED.
      
      NO BLUETOOTH TRANSFER OF SONGS AND OTHER STUFF
      
      
      ALL IN ALL LUMIA 920 IS GUD BUT IN ITS OWN BOUNDARIES. AS A WINDOWS PHONE IT IS GR8 WITH UBER CLASS CAMERA AND SCREEN BUT IN OVERALL MOBILES IT HAS SOME SHORTCOMINGS WHICH MAKE IT A NOT SO GR8 MOBILE"
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"MY FRIEND BOUGHT THIS PHONE 3 DAYS AGO INSTEAD OF BUYING A LAPTOP, WHICH IS PERHAPS THE MOST STUPIDEST DECISION ANYONE CAN EVER MAKE. I HAD SOME TIME TO PLAY WITH IT. THE PHONE HAS SOME AWARD WINING FEATURES LIKE:
      
      
      (OKAY, BEFORE I BEGIN, I MUST SAY, THE PHONE IS SIMPLY GORGEOUSLY TO LOOK AT AND IS A PLEASURE TO HOLD IN HAND. THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST HYPED PHONE OF THE YEAR.)
      
      
      1) THE PURE MOTION HD PLUS DISPLAY HAS PRETTY STRIKING IMAGE QUALITY...COMPARABLE TO AND IN SOME ASPECTS BETTER THAN THE BEST IN THE INDUSTRY. HIGHEST PIXEL DENSITY ON A MOBILE DEVICE.
      
      
      2) POSSIBLY THE BEST LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AVAILABLE IN A MOBILE PHONE. CAN GIVE COMPACT POINT AND SHOOT CAMERAS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.
      
      
      3) THE OS INTERFACE IS REALLY AN EYE CANDY TO WATCH. VERY IMPRESSIVE, FLUIDIC AND COLORFUL AND OFFERS MORE CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS THAN THE IOS.
      
      
      4) THE 1.5GHZ DUAL CORE KRAIT QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON PROCESSOR ALONG WITH THE ADRENO 225 GPU AND 1GB OF RAM IS PLENTIFUL TO RUN ANY APP AVAILABLE IN THE WINDOWS MARKETPLACE.
      
      
      5) OUT OF THE BOX WIRELESS CHARGING. VERY GOOD NFC INTEGRATION.
      
      
      6) BEST IN INDUSTRY GPS NAVIGATION SOLUTIONS AND CAPABILITIES.
      
      
      BUT..AND A BIG BUT...
      
      
      1) IN TERMS OF CUSTOMIZATION, WP 8 HAS STILL A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO IN COMPARISON WITH ANDROID.
      
      
      2) SOUND QUALITY THROUGH HEADPHONES IS MEDIOCRE AND IN NO WAYS UPTO TO THE MARK OF A 38K PHONE.
      
      
      3) NOT THE BEST IN CLASS HARDWARE AVAILABLE AT THAT PRICE POINT.
      
      
      4) BATTERY BACKUP IS UTTERLY UTTERLY BAD.
      
      
      5) TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS...THE NUMBER OF GOOD USABLE APPS IN THE WINDOWS MARKET PLACE IS SCARCELY LOW....APP STORE HAS MUCH CATCH UP TO DO IN COMPARISON WITH IOS AND ANDROID.
      
      
      6) DAYLIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY IS DOWNRIGHT AVERAGE. OKAY I SAID IT. I COMPARED IT WITH MY UNCLE'S GALAXY S3 AND MY CANON POWERSHOT PRICED AT JUST ABOUT 10K.
      
      
      9) NO FM RADIO IN A 38K PHONE. I MEAN THAT SUCKS !
      
      
      MY VERDICT: YOU WILL NOT CRY OR BE THOROUGHLY DISSAPOINTED IF YOU BUY THIS PHONE. BUT AT THIS PRICE POINT, THERE IS MUCH MUCH MORE TO BE DESERVED.
      
      
      THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS A GOOD 7K LESS AND OFFERS A FAR MORE SUPERIOR HARDWARE, MUCH MUCH MORE USABLE APPS, MORE OR LESS THE SAME QUALITY DISPLAY AND GOOD CAMERA AND VIDEO CAPABILITIES PLUS BETTER AUDIO QUALITY AND BIGGER SCREEN.
      
      
      HTC 8S HAS THE INDUSTRY LEADING AUDIO QUALITY AND IS PRICED AT ALMOST HALF THE PRICE OF THE LUMIA 920 AND ALSO COMES WITH WINDOWS PHONE 8.
      
      
      GALAXY NOTE 2 HAS ALL THE BENEFICIALS OF THE GALAXY S3 WITH BIGGER SCREEN, PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL HARDWARE ON A MOBILE DEVICE AND A KILLER FEATURE: THE S-PEN. AND IT COSTS 3K LESS THEN LUMIA 920.
      
      
      38K IS A HEFTY HEFTY PRICE TAG, BE A SMART CONSUMER AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE YOU MAKE A MOVE. I THINK WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY, ONE SHOULD OBVIOUSLY BUY THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2."
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"NOT BEING TOO INITIATED INTO THE FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY, BUYING A PHONE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A RELATIVELY SIMPLE DECISION FOR ME. BUT, COMING OF AGE, I WAS SURROUNDED WITH THIS NEED TO STAY CONNECTED AND GET MYSELF A SMART MOBILE DEVICE. WITH HELP FROM MY PALS, I HUNTED AROUND FOR A SMARTPHONE THAT DID NOT JUST LOOK GOOD, BUT WAS ALSO GREAT IN TERMS OF THE FEATURES IT OFFERED. AND I FOUND MY MARK WITH THE NOKIA LUMIA 920. THIS SMARTPHONE IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST AND BEATS THE COMPETITION HANDS DOWN. I LOVE THE WAY ITS UNIBODY POLYCARBONATE SHELL FEELS IN MY HAND AND INSPIRES CONFIDENCE. I HAVE ALWAYS TRUSTED MICROSOFT FOR THEIR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SO CONSEQUENTIALLY HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM. JUST THE AMOUNT OF CONVENIENCE AND EASE-OF-USE THAT THIS OS BRINGS TO THE TABLE IS ASTOUNDING. ALL MY PRODUCTIVITY, ENTERTAINMENT AND COMMUNICATION APPS SIT RIGHT ON MY HOME SCREEN; WAITING FOR A TAP OF MY FINGER TO SPRING INTO ACTION. MY CLOSEST PALS HAVE THIS HABIT OF STAYING CONNECTED VIA SOCIAL NETWORKS. WITH THE LUMIA 920, I CAN ARRANGE THEM ON MY HOME SCREEN USING PEOPLE HUB. THIS MEANS I AM INSTANTLY NOTIFIED IF ANY OF THEM POSTS A STATUS UPDATE. I HAVE BEEN ZIPPING THROUGH MY ASSIGNMENTS AT WORK EVEN ON THE MOVE. MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 SUPPORTS VIEWING AND EDITING OF MS OFFICE DOCUMENTS; SO BE IT WORD DOCS, EXCEL SPREADSHEETS OR POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS, I CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING WITH EQUAL EASE. THIS PHONE ALSO LETS ME STAY AWARE ABOUT CURRENT AFFAIRS AS I CAN BROWSE THE WEB AND STREAM MULTIMEDIA CONTENT AT HIGH SPEEDS VIA 3G AND LTE SERVICES. AT MALLS AND SHOPPING CENTRES, I CAN JUST SWITCH ON MY LUMIA 920?S WI-FI AND CHECK EMAILS OR SURF THE WEB. ADDITIONAL CONNECTIVITY FEATURES LIKE NFC AND BLUETOOTH MAKES LIFE MORE CONVENIENT AND HASSLE-FREE.
      
      AS FOR THE HARDWARE INSIDE MY PHONE, IT COMES WITH A POWERFUL DUAL-CORE 1.5 GHZ QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 'KRAIT' MOBILE PROCESSOR IN ADDITION TO AN ADRENO 225 GRAPHICS CHIP AND 1 GB RAM. THIS MAKES MULTI-TASKING A DELIGHT AND ALSO LET ME ENJOY HD GAMES WITHOUT ANY LAGS. I LOVE THE 8.7 MP CAMERA ON MY LUMIA 920 THAT RENDERS AWESOME IMAGES AND VIDEOS. WITH A CARL ZEISS TESSAR LENS, PUREVIEW CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND OPTICAL IMAGE STABILISATION, MY SNAPS AND VIDEO CLIPS COME OUT BLUR-FREE AND CLEAR. ADD A DUAL LED FLASH TO THE MIX AND I CAN EVEN CLICK PHOTOS IN LOW LIGHT. I LIKE THE WAY EVERYTHING IS DISPLAYED ON THE 4.5-INCH LCD TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY OF MY PHONE THAT IS ULTRA-RESPONSIVE DUE TO ITS INTEGRATED PUREMOTION HD+ TECHNOLOGY. WITH A SLIGHTLY CURVED DESIGN, THIS DISPLAY LETS ME READ AND VIEW STUFF WITH EASE, EVEN AT DIFFICULT VIEWING ANGLES. WHAT?S MORE MY LUMIA 920 CAN BE CHARGED WIRELESSLY BY JUST PLACING IT ON A CHARGING HUB."
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"ONLY 1 GB RAM? WHAT NOKIA IS THINKING. JUST DO SOME CONCENTRATION ON HARDWARE AS WELL.
      
      WHY PAY 35K FOR A PHONE WITH 1GB RAM.
      
      GOOD FEATURES ARE CAMERA AND SCREEN QUALITY OTHER THAN THAT NOTHING.
      
      I RATHER BUY SOME OTHER PHONE WITH BETTER SPECS."
Nokia Lumia 920,3,"WAS USING LUMIA 800 EARLIER AND UPGRADED TO 920 JUST BECAUSE I LOVE THE WINDOWS PHONE INTERFACE.
      
      PROS- SOLID BUILD, PREMIUM LOOK, 32GB MEMORY, CAMERA, AWESOME SREEN AND TOUCH, AWESOME SOCIAL NETWORK INTEGRATION WITHIN THE OS, NOKIA MAPS
      
      CONS- POOR BATTERY LIFE, NO INSTAGRAM (MOST IMP FOR THE AWESOME CAMERA IT HAS), MUSIC SOUND QUALITY IS NOT IMPRESSIVE, ARROGANT GOOGLE FOR NOT DEVELOPING APPS FOR WP8, NO SD CARD SUPPORT.
      
      TO SAVE BATTERY YOU HAVE TO STOP ALL THE BACKGROUND APPS, LOG OUT FACEBOOK, USE 3G ONLY WHEN REQUIRED."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"A SMARTPHONE WITHOUT APPS IS INCOMPLETE. I DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY TO BUY A PHONE COSTING AROUND 40K AND WAIT FOR APPS TO APPEAR. EVEN IF YOU WAIT, IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AS MR JAM'S REVIEW IS DATED 18 JAN AND IT'S MAY AND STILL THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF GAMES AVAILABLE ON THE WINDOWS STORE. BASIC GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN ALSO LAG ON THE LUMIA 920, WHAT MORE CAN YOU EXPECT FROM THE OTHER WINDOWS DEVICES. DON'T BELIEVE ME, JUST CHECK OUT THE REVIEWS ON THE WINDOWS STORE.I HAVE SEEN MID RANGE PHONE LIKE THE GALAXY S ADVANCE (ROOTED) HANDLING GAMES LIKE MC 4 SMOOTHLY AND IT COSTS ONLY 15K.
      
      
      ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT ALMOST ALL THE GAMES ARE PAID VERSIONS UNLIKE ANDROID AND IOS WHICH HAVE PLETHORA OF FREE GAMES. YOU NEED NOT SPEND MORE MONEY ON APPS AFTER BUYING AN EXPENSIVE PHONE. IT REALLY MATTERS FOR A STUDENT'S. I CANT SHED ALL MY POCKET MONEY BUYING APPS.
      
      REGARDING THE MEMORY 32 GB MUST BE ENOUGH FOR MOST OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE BUT EXPANDABILITY IS ALWAYS A BETTER OPTION FOR FOLKS WITH A LOT OF STUFF. AND PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT MEMORY CARDS SLOW DOWN A PHONE. I DON'T KNOW WHY MR JAM SAID THIS (PROBABLY HE TRIED A CLASS 4 CARD WITH GALAXY S3). UHS CARDS ARE AVAILABLE AND THEY OFFER SPEEDS GREATER THAN  50-60 MBPS. WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED.
      
      REGARDING THE DISPLAY, WELL IT IS ONE'S OWN OPINION. I STILL LOVE THE SATURATION OF THE HD SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY ON THE S3 AND NOTE 2. SOME MAY FIND THE LCD DISPLAY ON LUMIA 920 MORE APPEALING. WHATEVER IT IS, SUPER AMOLED PANELS USE MUCH LESS POWER THAN LCD AN ALSO OCCUPY LESS SPACE(LEADING TO A THINNER PHONE). AND YOU CALL A 2000MAH BATTERY A ""BIGGER BATTERY"". COME ON... THE BATTERY IS NON REMOVABLE. A LARGER BATTERY WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER DEAL(CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE PHONE).
      
      THE LUMIA 920 IS A GOOD DEVICE BUT WINDOWS PHONE 8 SPOILS THE PARTY. A DEVICE LIKE THIS WITH ANDROID 4.2 WOULD HAVE BEEN A WAY BETTER DEAL.
      
      GIVING 2 STARS BECAUSE I JUST LOVE THE INTERNET EXPLORER 10."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"AS MENTIONED IN THE SPECIFICATIONS THE TALK TIME IN 3G MODE IS 10 HOURS AND STAND BY TIME IS 460 HOURS, BUT I AM AFRAID OF MY LUMIA 920, AS IT GIVES ME ONLY 2 TO 3 HOURS WHILE USING IN 3G MODE, I HAVE PURCHASED NOKIA DC-11K FOR BATTERY BACK UP, SO I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE BATTERY PERFORMANCE, AS YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR CHARGER HANDY.
      
      REST ALL THE FEATURES ARE BRILLIANT........."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,AT 185 GRAMS IT WEIGHTS LIKE A BRICK. THERE IS A LIMITED CHOICE OF APPS FOR WINDOWS 8 AND THE INTERFACE IS CRAPPY. THERE IS NO SYSTEM-WIDE FILE MANAGER. THE AUDIO OUTPUT IS CRAPPY BEYOND BELIEF. THE ONLY PLUS POINT IS OFFLINE GPS.
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"BEING LONG TIME NOKIA USER (C7) FOR 2 YEARS AND THEN IPHONE 4S USER FOR 4 MONTHS, I GOT 920 FOR IT'S GREAT INTEGRATION WITH WINDOWS OFFICE PRODUCT. MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS PHONE FOR ME IS FOR BUSINESS PURPOSE. HOWEVER AFTER USING IT FOR 2 MONTHS, I AM REALLY MISSING GREAT FEATURES OF IPHONE AND FINALLY RETURNING TO IT. I WOULD SAY 920 IS GOOD LOOKING GIRLFRIEND AND IPHONE IS RELIABLE WIFE. SO FOR LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP GO FOR IPHONE, FOR SHORT TERM SHOW-OFF AND COOL LOOKS, GO FOR 920. FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE THINGS MISSING WINDOWS
      
      1. MULTIPLE EMAIL PREVIEW AND UPCOMING APPOINTMENTS NOT DISPLAYED ON LOCK-SCREEN. --&GT; REDUCES PRODUCTIVITY
      
      2. APP STORE SUCKS. EXAMPLE - NO GOOD TASK MANAGEMENT APP WITH INTEGRATION TO MICROSOFT OUTLOOK TASKS
      
      3. NO GOOD EXPENSE TRACKER APP
      
      4. YOU REDUCE THE VOLUME OF PHONE WHEN YOU ARE LISTENING ON HEADPHONES AND THAT REDUCES THE VOLUME OF PHONE'S RINGTONE AS WELL
      
      5. INFLEXIBLE AND MANY OF BASIC CUSTOMIZATIONS AVAILABLE IN IPHONE ARE MISSING
      
      6. CAMERA IS OK, NOT REALLY GREAT AS HYPED BY NOKIA
      
      7. OFFLINE MAPS APP WORKS BETTER ON NOKIA C7 THAN ON 920. 920 TAKES FOREVER TO LOCK ON GPS AND IDENTIFY LOCATION
      
      
      BUT HERE IS GOOD PART OF THIS PHONE, IT COMES WITH LIMITED TIME FREE SUBSCRIPTION TO NOKIA MUSIC FROM WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MANY SONGS FOR FREE FOR SOME TIME.
      
      
      SO THIS PHONE FEELS GOOD FOR SHORT TERM BUT NOT RECOMMENDED OVER IPHONE."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE BUT NOT THROUGH FLIPKART BEFORE 3 DAYS AGO
      
      
      PHONE IS OKAY BUT NOW THINKING SOMEHOW WASTED 38K FOR THIS. SOME GOOD THINGS AND BAD THINGS ARE.
      
      
      1. VERY GOOD DISPLAY AND NOKIA MUSIC
      
      2. DECENT BATTERY
      
      3. GREAT CAMERA PERFORMANCE
      
      
      SOME THINGS WHICH IRRITATES ME
      
      
      1. TRANSFERRING DATA TAKES CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. NOT SURE WHETHER THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROBLEM
      
      2. I DINT LIKE WINDOWS PHONE 8 AFTER USING SYMBIAN
      
      3. AVERAGE MUSIC QUALITY THROUGH EAR PHONES
      
      4. NO MICRO SD SORT. MY N8 IS FAR BETTER IN THIS"
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"FOR MY PEOPLE WHO THINK IF THEY LIKE A PHONE THEN THERE AREN'T ANY DEMERITS WITH IT I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION FEW DEMERITS LIKE S.D
      
      
      APP CATALOG FALLS SHORT OF ANDROID AND IOS
      
      NO MICROSD CARD
      
      NO FM RADIO
      
      NO SYSTEM-WIDE FILE MANAGER
      
      NO LOCKSCREEN SHORTCUTS
      
      SIZE &AMP; WEIGHT SOMETHING TO DEFINITELY CONSIDER BEFORE YOU BUY
      
      AUDIO OUTPUT NOT WORTHY OF A FLAGSHIP
      
      NON USER-REPLACEABLE BATTERY
      
      SOME SOFTNESS IN PHOTOS
      
      
      SO INSTEAD OF POINTING ON ONLY ITS MERIT PPL SHOULD ALSO POINT ON ITS DEMERIT
      
      (SUMANTH DAGGUBATI EVEN U NEED TO GET UR FACTS THOROUGHLY CHECKED OUT)"
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"I BOUGHT NL 920 THREE WEEKS AGO. SO HERE IS WHAT I FOUND ABOUT NL 920.
      
      
      FIRSTLY I WOULD TALK ABOUT ITS SCREEN ITS BRILLIANT. SUPERB SUNLIGHT VISIBILITY AND AMAZING CONTRAST AND NATURAL COLOURS. IT PRODUCES REAL LOW MOTION BLUR!! I WOULD RATE 10/10.
      
      NEXT ABOUT THE PROCESSOR AND  RAM. SNAPDRAGON PERFORMS VERY WELL AND THE AVAILABLE RAM IS ENOUGH HOWEVER 2 GB WOULD HAVE BEEN  BETTER. I DIDN?T FELT ANY LAG WHILE USING THE PHONE . SO I WOULD RATE
      
      PROCESSOR-10/10
      
      RAM-9/10
      
      NEXT I WOULD COME TO CAMERA. ITS 8.7 MP CAMERA DID PERFORM VERY WELL BUT NOT UPTO EXPECTATION. THE CAMERA INTERFACE  IS POOR . ITS OVERHYPED.
      
      FOR CAMERA-8.5/10
      
      NEXT ABOUT THE BATTERY. ALTHOUGH NL 920 HAS 2000 MAH  BATTERY ITS BACK UP IS BAD. I FOUND ON HEAVY USAGE [USING INTERNET OVER 3G DOWNLOADING, PLAYING  SOME GAMES FOR 10 MINUTES, USING SOME GPS AND SOME OTHER APPS] IT HARDLY LASTED 8 HOURS WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. MOREOVER THE BACK OF THE PHONE BECOMES VERY HEATED UP. I TESTED  THIS ON LOWEST SCREEN BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS.
      
      FOR BATTERY-5/10
      
      NEXT ABOUT THE CALL RECEPTION AND SIGNAL STRENGTH. DURING MY USAGE IN ALL THESE DAYS I RECEIVED AND DIALLED MANY NUMBERS AND DIDN?T FACE ANY CALL DROP ISSUES.THE SOUND FROM  THE SPEAKER WAS DISTINCT AND CLEAR AND LOUD ENOUGH.
      
      BUT ABOUT THE SIGNAL RECEPTION IT HAS SOME WEAK SIGNAL RECEPTION CAPABILITY NEARLY 8-10% LESSER THAN MY NOKIA 5230 WHICH IS DISAPPOINTING FROM THIS HIGH END PHONE.
      
      FOR CALL QUALITY-10/10
      
      FOR NETWORK RECEPTION-7/10
      
      NEXT ABOUT THE AUDIO AND VIDEO PLAYBACK. VIDEO PLAYBACK QUALITY WAS SUPERB @30FPS BUT UNLIKE GALAXY S3 , GALAXY NOTE2 , HTC ONE X IT SUPPORTS MANY LESS FORMATS. SO YOU WONT BE ABLE TO PLAY ALL THE VIDEOS.
      
      AND ABOUT THE AUDIO PLAYBACK. THE SOUND QUALITY FROM  THE STEREO SPEAKERS REALLY GREAT AND  LOUD ENOUGH. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HEADPHONES IT IS AGAIN DISAPPOINTING. THE RETAIL PACKAGE HEADPHONE WITH IS BAD. I COMPARED WITH MY NOKIA 5230 USING PHILIPS SHE 9550 HEADPHONE. THE THUMP&AMP; BASS DEPTH WAS WORSE THAN 5230. EVEN WHILE PLAYING AT HIGHER LEVELS [25+] THE SOUND FROM  HEADPHONES WAS NOT DISTINCT AND  A LITTLE DISTORTED COMPARED TO N 5230. ALTHOUGH NL920 HAS DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND BUT THE RESULT IS NOT UP TO MARK
      
      SO FOR VIDEO PLAYBACK-8/10
      
      AUDIO PLAYBACK-8/10
      
      NEXT THE USER INTERFACE. THE USER INTERFACE IS AMATEUR COMPARED TO ANDROID AND I PHONE. MANY MAJOR THINGS ARE LACKING. EG YOU CANNOT SET ANY RINGTONE VOLUME SEPARATELY, POOR MULTITASKING ETC.
      
      SO FOR USER INTERFACE-6.5/10
      
      NEXT ABOUT THE BROWSER. NL920 HAS THE INTERNET EXPLORER. TRUST ME NL920 HAS ONE OF THE BEST BROWSING CAPABILITIES WITH THE IE . YOU CAN BOOK TICKETS , FILL  ONLINE FORMS , RECHARGE YOUR ACCOUNTS AND ZERO LAG..
      
      FOR BROWSER-10/10
      
      LASTLY ABOUT THE BUILD QUALITY . UNLIKE THE GALAXY NL 920 HAS BEEN  BUILT LINE A PREMIUM PHONE. YOU WOULDN?T FEEL ANY CHEAP PLASTIC FEELING. ITS BUILT LIKE TANK. HEAVY AND STANDARD LOOK . TO ME WEIGHT WAS NOT ANY ISSUE.
      
      FOR BUILD -9.5/10
      
      
      SO OVERALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY NOKIA HAS TRIED WELL TO CAPTURE THE HIGH END MARKET BUT THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS LACKINGS IN THEIR MOST INNOVATIVE PHONE.
      
      NO DOUBT NL920 IS THE BEST WINDOWS PHONE IN THE MARKET BUT UNLESS YOU ARE A DIE HARD FAN OF WINDOWS OS DONT GO FOR IT!. YOU WILL GET MUCH BETTER SMARTPHONES IN THE 34K RANGE.
      
      SO HERE ARE SOME COMPARATIVE OVERALL RATINGS.
      
      GALAXY S3-92/100
      
      HTC ONEX-91/100
      
      GALAXY NOTE2-94/100
      
      I PHONE 5-89/100
      
      LUMIA 920-85/100
      
      
      RECENTLY ON (3 MARCH) I FACED SOME MAJOR ISSUES. WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC, PHONE HANGED AND AFTER THAT SCREEN WENT BLACK AND NO RESPONSE. NEITHER I CAN SWITCH IT OFF NOR I CAN REMOVE ITS BATTERY TO RESTART IT DUE ITS INNOVATIVE NON REMOVABLE BATTERY AND ALSO YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD OFFLINE MAPS OTHER THAN WI FI NETWORK,NO NATIVE VIDEO CALLING MEANS U WILL HAVE TO USE SKYPE AND PAY TO SKYPE FOR VIDEO CALLING. THANK GOD I HAVE MY OLD W910I AND SE HAZEL J20I FOR VIDEO CALLING. MOREOVER THERE IS NO FILE MANAGER , NO DECENT PDF VIEWER.
      
      
      SO MY OVERALL RATING FURTHER GOES DOWN FROM 85 TO 80/100. SO BEWARE"
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT I SHOULD GIVE THE LUMIA 920 A TRY. THIS AFTER HAVING BEEN ADDICTED TO IPHONE AND A LITTLE FLIRTING WITH EARLY VERSION OF ANDROID.
      
      
      AT THE OUTSET THE PHONE IS TOO HEAVY FOR MY LIKING, UNFORTUNATELY THE PHONE I TESTED WAS RED IN COLOR AND RESEMBLED A BRICK.
      
      
      NO SMARTPHONE IS SMART WITHOUT GOOGLE AND SHOCKINGLY THERE IS NO NATIVE APPS FOR GOOGLE SEARCH, YOUTUBE, GOOGLE MAPS ETC. REAL SHOCKER.
      
      
      FINALLY I MADE UP MY MIND THAT NOTHING BETTER THAN IOS AND IPHONE, I UPGRADED MY IPHONE 4S FOR A SLICK IPHONE 5.
      
      
      SORRY NOKIA YOU GOT IT WRONG ON BOTH THE FEEL OF THE HANDSET (ESP WEIGHT) AND A THE OS (UNIMPRESSIVE TO SAY THE LEAST)."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"I HAVE USED THIS PHONE FOR SOMETIME. DID NOT FIND ANYTHING EXTRAORDINARY. I BELIEVE, THIS CANNOT TAKEOVER ANDROID. MOREOVER, THIS IS THE FIRST SERIES OF W8 PHONES. I BELIEVE THERE ARE BETTER W8 PHONES TO COME IN THE COMING DAYS WITH FEATURES  LIKE PUREVIEW, MUCH IMPROVED OS ETC. WAIT FOR BETTER W8 PHONES GUYS."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"I WAS FOLLOWING NOKIA LUMIA 920 FROM THE FIRST PUBLIC PREVIEW. IT'S DEAD EVEN BEFORE THE START AND REASON IS PRICE. FLAGSHIP ANDROID PHONE SAMSUNG IS WELL RS 7000 CHEAPER. IT HAS COMPLETELY DEVELOPED ECOSYSTEM AND RECOGNITION.
      
      
      920 IS A VERY NICE PHONE BUT NOKIA NEED TO PRICE IT CORRECTLY FOR A FIGHTING CHANCE. PROBLEM WITH NOKIA IS COMPETITION IS EXTREMELY TOUGH. A PHONE TO SUCCESS BEING VERY SOLID PHONE IS FIRST THINGS BUT THEN PRICE, MARKETING, ECOSYSTEM ALL COUNTS. NOKIA IS REALLY FAILING ON OTHER ASPECTS."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"I WAS IN LOVE WITH WINDOWS PHONE AND WAS LONGING TO BUY A LUMIA. THE OS IS ABSOLUTELY FLUID AND THERE'S NO LAG EVER EVEN ON THE CHEAPEST MODELS(I ALSO OWN A 520). THE SCREEN IS AMAZING, THE CAMERA IS GOOD. THE SPEAKERS ARE SO-SO, (NOT CLEAREST AROUND, SOME KIND OF ECHO OR RE-VERB FEELING.)
      
      MARKETPLACE IS FINE FOR A NEW OS, OBVIOUSLY NOTHING COMPARED TO IOS AND ANDROID STORES.
      
      
      MY MAIN NIGHTMARE WAS AND STILL IS THE BATTERY, IT SUCKS BIG TIME, I THINK ITS PROBABLY THE OS. I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK ITS SOMETHING AS SIMPLE THAT CAN BE RECTIFIED WITH MINOR TWEAKS OR SETTINGS CHANGE FROM THE PHONE. AFTER REALIZING THIS, I RESEARCHED A LOT ON THE WEB AND AMONG FRIENDS WHO OWN A WINDOWS PHONE ALL HAVE BELOW AVERAGE RATINGS FOR THE BATTERY. SO BEWARE!!!
      
      
      I PRAY AND HOPE AND BEG MICROSOFT TO LOOK INTO THIS SERIOUSLY, BUT I ONCE AGAIN HIGHLY DOUBT ITS THAT SIMPLE OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALREADY DONE, OR THEY MIGHT NOT BE SERIOUS.
      
      
      ANYWAYS APART FROM THAT EVERYTHING'S ALMOST FINE.
      
      
      ITS JUST THAT AFTER SPENDING THIS MUCH MONEY ITS JUST NOT FEELING WORTH IT. I KNOW APPS AREN'T THE END OF THE WORLD BUT IT SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED FOR SUCH HIGH RANGE PRODUCTS. WE HAVE LOTS OF GOOD GAMES AND APPS MISSING, MOST NICE ONES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ARE PAID, AND YOU CANT EVEN PURCHASE ANY THING UNLESS YOU HAVE A CREDIT CARD.
      
      
      GAMES ARE HUGE BATTERY HOG. STILL FAR WAY TO GO FOR THE OS.
      
      
      ITS SUCH A SAD IRONY THAT I WAS LUSTING AFTER THIS LIKE CRAZY FOR 6 MONTHS AND NOW THAT I GOT IT, ITS A HUGE LET DOWN. I DIDN'T WANT THE RESTRICTION OF IOS OR INSECURITY OR LAG FROM ANDROID, BUT IT SEAMS THEY ARE WAY BETTER THAN THIS OS.
      
      
      PLEASE DON'T ADVICE TO WAIT FOR 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR FOR THINGS TO GET AMAZING. WHY WOULD I PURCHASE A PHONE WITH LACK OF FEATURES AND WAIT ON IT. INSTEAD OF PROMISING 1 HUGE UPDATE, MICROSOFT SHOULD RELEASE SMALL LITTLE UPDATES AS AN WHEN THEY GET READY.
      
      
      I CANT BELIEVE I HAVE TO CHARGE THINS THING 2-3 TIMES A DAY, WHICH 2000 MAH BATTERY INSIDE IT.
      
      
      I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO GO FOR IPHONE 4S, BATTERY IS A LITTLE BETTER AND STABLE, SMOOTH OS AND APPS, PUSH NOTIFICATIONS WORK AMAZINGLY(AGAIN NOT UP TO THE MARK ON WINDOWS PHONE)."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"I WAS USING ANDROID 2.3 PHONE SINCE LAST 2 YEARS.BUT IT WAS FEELS LIKE MORE COMFORTABLE,MORE BETTER, SMARTER AND GOOD CONNECTIVITY.LIKE CAN SEND VOICE MESSAGES ON FACEBOOK SINCE 4 MONTHS. PUT YOUR TIME TABLE, HAND WRITTEN NOTES ON HOME SCREEN,FB ON HOME SCREEN.DON'T TELL ME THIS IS A ONLY PROBLEM. I CAN'T FOUND FREE SMS INDIA TYPE APP ON WIN APP STORE. ONLY BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU HAVEN'T USE ANDROID.. AND ABOUT NOKIA : IT IS MAKING FOOL PEOPLE BY MANY PHONES.IN ANDROID U CAN GET BETTER INTERFERENCE BY GO LAUNCHER.LAUNCHER8 IS EVEN EASIER THAN THIS.GOOD EMAIL HANDLER IS GOOD IN ANDROID. BUT SOME(NOT ALL) WINDOWS PHONE USERS ARE MAKING NOISE BCOZ THEY MAY BE DISSAPOINTED. HOW TO GET CRICKET LIVE SCOREBOARD, HAND NOTES, OR EVENTS OR FB OR TWITTER WORKING ON HOME SCREEN IN THIS PHONE.

      I CAN ONLY SAY.THE POSITION &AMP; CAPABILITY &AMP; USABILITY ANDROID HAVING......WP CANT THINK ABOUT IT WHETHER ITS WP-8,9 OR 10.
      
      
      I KNOW GUYS U R MIGRATING FROM ANDROID TO WP FOR A REFRESHING OS &AMP; BY READING THE GOOD REVIEWS ABOUT WP.

      SO ""CHOOSE WISELY,LIVE WELL"".......HA HA....."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,"PHONE SEEMS TO BE GOOD BUT WHY YOU SHOULD PAY 38K FOR THIS WHEN THERE ARE MUCH BETTER PHONES THAN LUMIA 920.
      
      
      1. DUAL CORE 1.5 KRAIT--&GT;QUAD CORES PHONES SUCH AS SAMSUNG S3, NOTE 2, HTC ONE X, LG OPTIMUS 4X HD ARE ALREADY THERE AND THOSE ARE CHEAPER THAN THIS NOKIA.
      
      2. NO MEMORY CARD SUPPORT--&GT;WHAT YOU ARE GETTING IS 32 GIG MEMORY. WHERE IS THE FREEDOM TO HOT SWAP YOUR FILES?
      
      
      3. NO FM RADIO--&GT;THIS IS A STANDARD FEATURE AVAILABLE IN ALL NOKIA PHONES. NOKIA IS SLEEPING WHEN THEY DESIGNED IT?
      
      4. IT IS WINDOWS PHONE 8 WHICH IS STILL A NEW KID IN TOWN.
      
      
      5. GSM ARENA SUGGESTS THE AUDIO QUALITY NOT THAT MUCH GREAT
      
      
      I SUGGEST NOT TO INVEST IN THIS PHONE ATLEAST FOR 6 TO 7 MONTHS WHEN NOKIA REALIZES THE PRODUCT IS NOT SELLING AS THEY EXPECTED IN THE MARKET AND START A PRICE CUT. BUYING THIS PHONE FOR LESS THAN 30 K WOULD BE ADVISABLE.
      
      
      NOKIA IS A SLOW LEARNER."
Nokia Lumia 920,2,PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE......FROM THE VERY SECOND DAY IT GIVES ME PROBLEM.....FIRST HANG_THEN SHUT DOWN_THEN NOT BOOT......I HV SUBMITTED THIS PHONE TO NOKIA CARE 4 TIMES....YES 4 TIMES IN 1 MONTHS....IN EACH AND EVERY TIME THEY GAVE ME THE PHONE BACK IN 2DAYS.....AFTER USING THE PHONE 2-3 DAYS PEACEFULLY THE SAME PROBLEM IS ARISING....IM WRITITING THIS REVIEW WHEN MY NOKIA LUMIA 920 IS IN NOKA CARE.....FED UP WITH THIS PHONE.....PLEASE DONT BUY....INVEST THE MONEY IN ANOTHER PHONE...BUT DONT BUY THIS....
Nokia Lumia 920,2,THE PHONE HAS GOOD LOOKS BUT VERY LITTLE APPS TO PLAY WITH (ITS BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE THE LAUNCH OF WINDOWS 8 AND YET NOT MUCH APPS!!) AND 36K FOR A DUEL CORE PROCESSOR!! I GOT RIPPED!! GO FOR A MOBILE WITH QUAD CORE PROCESSOR..THATZ FUTURE!
Nokia Lumia 920,2,VERY PRICEY GIVEN ITS DATED SPECS. CAMERA IS BEST IN CLASS WHILE BATTERY IS WORST IN CLASS. I REGRET BUYING IT AT 31K...SHUD HAVE WAITED TILL IT FELL SUB 25K. NOKIA HAS A DONE A EXCELLENT JOB WITH BUILD QUALITY BUT DIDNOT GIVE DUE CONSIDERATION TO THE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET...JUST WONDER WHY WUD ANYONE GO FOR A DATED PHONE FOR 31K WHEN U HAVE THE NEXUS 4 OFFERING THE LATEST SPECS AT AROUND 10K CHEAPER
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T PURCHASE IT FROM FLIPKART, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY REVIEW AFTER USING IT FOR 5 MONTHS SO THAT NO ONE ELSE FALLS FOR THIS OVERPRICED PIECE OF JUNK LIKE I DID.
      
      PROS:
      
      1. NICE CAMERA
      
      2. GOOD BUILD QUALITY
      
      3. QUICK CHARGING TIME - 15-20% TO FULL IN 1.5-2 HOURS
      
      4. LOUDSPEAKER IS LOUD
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. AWFUL BATTERY LIFE- USING IT FOR BROWSING FOR 1 HOUR-1.5 HOURS AND IT WILL BE DOWN TO 20-30%
      
      
      2. NO GOOD APPS  - PHONE WAS LAUNCHED NOV. 2012 AND STILL YOU ARE WAITING FOR APPS !!! SHAME ON NOKIA
      
      
      3. SEALED PHONE - IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, THE ONLY OPTION YOU HAVE IS NOKIA CARE CENTER
      
      
      4. MULTITASKING IS A JOKE - TRY OPENING 6-7 APPS AT ONCE AND THE PHONE HANGS, CRASHES..
      
      
      5. LIVE TILES? 99% OF THE APPS YOU WILL USE CANNOT UPDATE LIVE TILES REGULARLY. (ONLY ONCE IN 1 HOUR). THINK OF LIVE TILES AS NOTHING BUT APP SHORTCUTS
      
      
      6. STUCK ON HARD RESET - MAJOR KNOWN ISSUE - TRY GOOGLING "" LUMIA 920 STUCK AT SPINNING GEARS"" AND YOU WILL SEE ISSUE. FYI, I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT MYSELF, TRIED ALL STEPS MENTIONED ONLINE, NOTHING WORKED. I AM GOING TO TAKE IT TO A SERVICE CENTER TOMORROW.
      
      
      7. NO CUSTOMIZATION FREEDOM COMPARED TO ANDROID.
      
      
      8. CALLS WOULD DROP ALL OF A SUDDEN EVEN WHEN THE NETWORK SIGNAL STRENGTH IS FULL.
      
      
      9. OS STARTS LAGGING, RANDOM REBOOTS AFTER USING FOR 2-3 MONTHS.
      
      
      WP8 IS A GOOD OS BUT, CURRENTLY ITS NOT AS GOOD AS ANDROID. IT'S PLAGUED BY VARIOUS BUGS, LACK OF APPS. ETC ETC.
      
      MY ADVICE - IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY, GO FOR A GOOD ANDROID PHONE. BUT IF YOU ARE A WINDOWS FAN OR LIKE TO HAVE AN AWESOME CAMERA (WITH PHONE FEATURES), YOU CAN BUY THIS ONE.
      
      
      I AM PLANNING TO SELL OFF MINE AS SOON AS IT GETS IN THE WORKING CONDITION. ANYONE INTERESTED TO BUY LUMIA 920 AT A THROWAWAY PRICE, CONTACT ME"

      WELL !!! NOW FLIPKART HAS LOST ALL ITS GLORY...  I DON'T KNOW WHOM TO BLAME FLIPKART , WS RETAIL, OR EKART LOGISTICS...!!! BUT I THINK THEY ALL ARE SAME.
      
      
      THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'M ORDERING FROM FLIPKART.
      
      
      I ORDERED THE DEVICE ON 29TH MAY.. WITH EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE OF 7 JUNE. BUT I NEVER DID RECEIVE THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY PHONE :-(
      
      IT CAME TO MY CITY ON 6 TH OF JUNE (PUNE) AND IT WAS REDIRECTED TO MUMBAI THE SAME DAY. I DON'T KNOW WHY!! WHEN ASKED THEY SAID IT WAS THE PROBLEM WITH 'YOUR' COURIER. SO THEY ADVISED   ME TO REISSUE IT AGAIN. SO I DID AND HISTORY REPEATED ITSELF. TODAY IT AGAIN WAS REDIRECTED TO MUMBAI.
      
      
      MAYBE NOW I'M CANCELING MY ORDER. WHOLE OF THE FLIPKART THING STINKS NOW. I'M DONE WITH IT.
      
      BUT I'M IN A DILEMMA WEATHER TO WAIT FOR FLIPKART TO SEND IT BACK TO ME OR I BUY IT FROM A NOKIA STORE.
      
      
      ACTUALLY I GOT MY LUMIA FOR 26K ONLY :-) THEY REFUNDED ME 4K AS THEY WERE NOT GIVING ME WIRELESS CHARGING PLATE. BUT YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO WAIT ,KNOWING THAT YOU CANT DO ANYTHING TO MAKE DELIVERY FASTER AND UPON THAT YOU GET HIGHLY OBSESSED AS TO WHEN YOUR DELIVERY IS COMING.
      
      I NEVER HAD SUCH PROBLEM WITH FLIPKART UNTIL I PAID BY CREDIT CARD.
      
      I HAVE LOST FAITH IN FLIPKART, I WILL NOT RATE THE PRODUCT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE IT YET.
      
      
      FOLKS I DEEPLY ADVICE YOU NOT TO BUY EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS FROM FLIPKART (SPECIALLY BY PREPAYMENT) , IT WILL GIVE YOU NOTHING MORE THAN HEADACHE.
      
      
      OBSESSIVELY WAIT FOR 13 DAYS... AND COUNTING....."
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"? AM NOT AT ALL AGAINST NOKIA OR WINDOWS 8....ITS TOTALLY MY PERSONAL OPINION...........NOKIA LUMIA 920 FOR 37K...HUHH.....NOKIA WAKE UP.......JUST FOR A GOOD CAMERA, I WILL NOT BUY THIS PHONE, INSTEAD BUY A DEDICATED CAMERA FOR 10-15K......THIS ERA IS NOW OF FULL HD SCREENS AND GAMING ......ALSO PREMIUM SMARTPHONES OF MOST COMPANY NOW COME IN 4.8'' OR 5'' SCREEN OR EVEN HIGHER IN SOME CASES.... PHONE IS DAMN BULKY AS FAR AS WEIGHT AND WIDTH IS CONCERNED.........ALSO A LOT OF TOP AND BOTTOM PORTION IS EXTENDED (I MEAN BELOW TOUCH BUTTONS APPROX AN INCH IS EXTENDED MAKING THE PHONE BIGGER FOR NO USE)....HANGS LIKE HELL.......I RECCOMEND TO BUY NOKIA PHONES AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS, BY THEN W8 WILL BE UPGRAGED TO BETTER APPS AND FEATURES THAN THE COMMON ONES(EVEN YOUTUBE APP NOT PRESENT IN NOKIA STORE....LOL).......THERE ARE MANY BETTER PHONES IN THIS RANGE......IF U ARE STILL CONFUSED YOU CAN CHECK SUDIPTA MONDAL'S OR VARUN'S REVIEW BELOW SOMEWHERE....."
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"I BROUGHT THE MOBILE 3 DAYS AGO. FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS IT WAS ALL GOING GOOD...NICE TOUCH, NICE CAMERA, NEW INTERFACE WITH WINDOWS 8 OS...OVERALL A GOOD EXPERIENCE. BUT ON THE 3RD DAY ITSELF, SUDDENLY THE HANDSET STOPPED RESPONDING. IT WENT INTO SORT OF DEAD STATE...FIRST I THOUGHT MAY BE IT WAS SWITCHED OFF AND THERE IS SOME PROBLEM WITH TURNING ON THE HANDSET, BUT WHEN I CALLED MY NO FROM A FRIEND'S CELL IT WAS RINGING BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE ON MY HANDSET. SO IT WAS NO DISPLAY...NO SOUND...NO RESPONSE!!! SO THE PHONE IS ACTUALLY TURNED ON WITHOUT ANY INPUT/OUTPUT. WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE NOKIA CARE THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING(THAT'S EXPECTED...THEY COULDN'T EVEN TAKE THE RISK OF OPENING THE MOBILE) &AMP; TOLD ME THEY WOULD SEND IT TO THE FACTORY AND IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER 15 DAYS TO REPAIR. SO I HAD TO SEND MY NEW MOBILE TO ICU WITHIN 3 DAYS ONLY...HAD A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS FROM THIS WINDOWS 8 PHONE BUT REALLY IT TURNED OUT TO BE A DISAPPOINTMENT..."
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"I GOT LUMIA 920 BEFORE 10 DAYS BEFORE..... AND I ALREADY VISIT NOKIA CARE CENTER 5 TO 6 TIME
      
      REASON WHY....
      
      1.FIRST TIME IT WAS NOT BOOTING WHEN I WAS RECEIVING MY CALL AT THAT TIME ONLY IT WAS GOES BLANK AND IT WAS NOT SUPPORTING CHARGING ALSO...
      
      2.THIS TIME MY SENSOR WAS NOT WORKING SO I WAS UNABLE TO DISCONNECT THE CALL AS WELL AS I CANT INSERT THE OPTION WHILE I MAKE A CALL TO CUSTOMER CARE..THIS TIME THEY SAID YOUR MB NEED TO SEND HEADQUARTER SO AFTER 10 DAYS WE CAN LET YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
      
      
      NOW I DON'T HAVE MY LUMIA920 AND I HAVE TO WAIT TILL 9  MARCH
      
      FINALLY I GOT IT BACK AGAIN BUT ITS NOT WORKING PROPERLY
      
      AND WHILE YOU WILL MAKE A CALL THEN IT WILL GET TOO MUCH HOT SO CANT TALK CONTINUE....
      
      SO JUST ANALYSIS THESE ALL THINGS WHICH I FACED AND REALLY I WANT TO INFORM ALL OF U THESE FEW'S DRAWBACK WHICH I SUFFRING.......
      
      
      SO PLZ MY SUGGESTION IS THINK THRICE  BEFORE PURCHASE LUMIA 920"
Nokia Lumia 920,1,I MEAN HOW CAN YOU EVEN COMPARE THIS PHONE TO ANDROID PHONES? I MEAN THEY ARE CHARGING 37.5 K FOR THIS ONE?? BULLSHIT...IN THAT AMOUNT GO FOR SONY XPERIA Z...WITH 5 INCH SCREEN N QUAD CORE PROCESSOR..THIS BULLSHIT OFFERS DUAL CORE..ALSO POOR VALUE FOR APPLICATIONS...! GUYS I FEEL NOKIA HAS PLUNDERED INDIAN MARKET FOR AROUND 10-12 YEARS BUT THEY STILL FEEL INDIANS ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO FOR THIS SHIT PHONES THEY ARE OFFERING WHICH ARE LESS THAN ALL OTHER PHONES IN EACH N EVERY ASPECTS...THEIR OVERCONFIDENT PRICING MAKES ME THINK THEY REALLY UNDERESTIMATE INDIAN PEOPLE..THE BIGGEST PROOF FOR THIS IS THE EMPTY NOKIA PHONE SHOPS IN EACH AND EVERY MARKET...SO PEOPLE  WAKE UP AND BE SMART...NOKIA IS A GONER NOW...SO DONT BE GONE WITH IT...!
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH THE REVIEW MADE BY JAM.
      
      1) YOU JUST NEED TO WAIT FOR COUPLE OF MONTHS TO GET ALL THE TOP APPS THAT ARE NOW MAKING WAVES ON ANDROID. I'M SURE THEY WILL WORK BEST ON WINDOWS PHONES ONCE THEY ARE MADE AVAILABLE.
      
      I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT WINDOWS PHONES WAS LAUNCHED IN 2007. FIRST WINDOWS PHONE WAS BOUGHT BY HTC. I STRONGLY FROM 2007 MICROSFT IS MAKING APPLICATION FOR WINDOWS PHONES. HOW MANY 5 YEARS NOW STILL THEY ARE DEVELOPING APPLICATIONS. IN 5 YEARS THEY CANNOT BRING TOP APPS HOW THEY BRING IN COUPLE OF MONTHS.
      
      I AGREE WITH NOKIA HARDWARE AND QUALITY OF PHONE. BUT ONLY HARDWARE MAKES A PHONE SUCCESS. HERE OPERATING SYSTEM IS THE MAJOR KEYROLE FOR SMARTPHONES. THAT'S Y SAMSUNG AMD APPLE SUCCESS IN MAKING PHONES. I AGREE SAMSUNG QUALITY NOT THAT MUCH GOOD COMPARE TO NOKIA AND APPLE IN HARDWARE. BUT IT IS TOP SELLING PHONE IN THE WORLD AFTER APPLE. WHY..? DID U KNOW THAT ITS ONLY SOFTWARE AND CUSTOMIZATION. THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE FREEDOM TO CUSTOMIZE AND USERFRIENDLY INTERFACE...SAMSUNG IS BRINGING LATEST TECHNOLOGY LIKE NFC ETC THAT NOKIA TRIED TO COPY ALL THESE FEATURES TO COMPETATE SAMSUNG AND APPLE. I KNOW THAT TOO MUCH ADVERTISING IN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS.
      
      ONE THING PEOPLE WHO RECENTLY BOUGHT WINDOWS 7.5 PHONES WHAT THEY WILL DO THEY ARE NOT GETTING ANY WINDOWS 8 UPDATE THEY R LIMITED WINDOWS 7.8. Y MICROSOFT IS LEAVING THERE VALUALBLE CUSTOMERS LIKE THAT. HERE APPLE TAKES THE WIN. THEY WILL UPDATE THERE PHONES SOFTWARE FROM IPHONE 3G TO IPHONE 5 SAME OS THAT IO6. STILL OLDER APPLE PHONES GETTING THE LATEST VERSION OF APPLE UPDATES. BUT PEOPLE WHO RECENTLY BOUGHT WINDOWS 7.5 PHONES GOT STUCK IN WINDOWS 7.8 UPDATE. NOW TELL ME WHO IS MONEY MAKING GIANT MICROSOFT OR ANDROID OR APPLE.. THEY COMPANY WHO DIDN'T SUPPORT THERE COSTOMERS PURCHASING HOW CAN THEY MAKE SUCCESS. THEY ARE BUSY IN LAUNCHING NEW MODELS. IM NEITHER A MICRSOFT FAN NOR A ANDROID OR APPLE FAN. BUT THIS IS THE TRUTH..........."
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH YOUR COMMENT SWARANDEEP CHAUDHARY.  THE SAME COMPANY WHO LAUNCHED WINDOWS PHONE IN 2007 BOUGHT WINDOWS PHONES OS IN 2010... OK ,,, EXPLAIN NOW ITS ABT 2 YEARS STILL THEY BEHIND IN DEVELOPING APPLICATION SUDDENLY LUMIA 920 LAUNCHED ALL TOP APPLICATION WILL DEVELOP IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS OR WHAT. ITS JUST MARKETING TO PUSH THE PEOPLE TO BUY.
      
      AND I ALSO DISAGREE UR SECOND POINT THAT APPLE 3GS ALSO GOT THE LATEST APPLE OS SIO6. IF U HAVE DOUBT ON THIS CHECK THE APPLE OR RELATED WEBSITE..
      
      CHECK THE LATEST NEWS WHICH MOBILE COMPANT SELL THEIR PRODUCTS LAST YEAR SAMSUNG OR APPLE. THIRD THING I HAVE TO TELL ABT WINDOWS 7.8 UPDATE THIS I HEARD ABT SIX MONTHS BEFORE. EVERY TIME THEY SAYING IT WILL UPDATE OCT,NOVEM,DECEMBER,JANUARY LIKE THAT STILL WE DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY UPDATES FROM MICROSOFT HOW CAN THEY THINH ABT WINDOWS 7.9. FIRST TALK ABT THE PRESENT STAGE. WHAT ABT WINDOWS 7.8 UPDATE AFTER WE WILL TALK ABT WINDOWS 7.9 UPDATE. OK IM AGREE FOR THE REVIEW ABT NFC PATENT NOKIA LAUNCHED IN 2006.
      
      FOURTH THING THERE IS NO NOTIFICATION CENTER IN WINDOWS PHONES.
      
      FOURTH , NO NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
      
      THIS ONE IS THE BIGGEST DEAL BREAKER FOR ME BECAUSE I AM AN APP JUNKIE AND IF AN APP ALERTS ME , SHOULD I WAIT FOR TILE TO FLIP ? IF I GET 100 NOTIFICATIONS FROM 30 APPS , THEN SHOULD I STARE AT EACH TILE AND FOR IT TO FLIP TO SEE WHATS HAPPENING ? NOTIFICATION SYSTEM GIVES U CONTROL AND MAKE THINGS EASIER IDK WHAT MS OR NOKIA WAS THINKING.......... THAT MEANS IF U GOT THREE OR FOUR MAILS OR MESSAGES WE HAVE TO SEARCH EACH TILE WHERE AND  WHICH MAIL OR MESSAGE HAD COME.ITS QUITE ANNOYING.."
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"I WAS ENJOYING USING THIS PRODUCT UNTIL ONE NIGHT I PUT IT FOR CHARGING AND WOKE UP TO SEE A SINGLE SMALL CRACK ON THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER OF THE GLASS, WHERE THE NOKIA LOGO IS, DEVELOP FROM THE INSIDE,. I WENT TO NOKIA CARE AND THEY TOLD ME GLASS IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND ASKED ME TO PAY 13K FOR REPAIRS. I CALLED UP NOKIA AND THE SUPPORT EXECUTIVE SAID THAT IT COUNTS AS PHYSICAL DAMAGE. WHEN I EXPLAINED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY TO DAMAGE THE DEVICE, THE CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE SAID ""YOU MUST BE PRESSING THE SCREEN TOO HARD !"" AND THIS IS A GORILLA GLASS 2 DISPLAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I DON'T WANT IT TAKE A BEATING, BUT I CERTAINLY EXPECT IT TO NOT BREAK DURING REGULAR USE. I EVEN VOLUNTEERED TO SEND THE DEVICE TO NOKIA SO THAT THEY CAN SEE THAT THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN DAMAGED BY ME. THEY SIMPLY REFUSED.
      
      DON'T BE FOOLED BY DROP TEST VIDEOS AND SUCH OVER THE INTERNET. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING THE PRODUCT. MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED OF AN EXTREMELY WEAK GLASS THAT GETS EASILY CRACKED AND NOKIA CARE SIMPLY REFUSES TO HELP SAYING PHYSICAL DAMAGE.
      
      MIND YOU, IT IS A GOOD PHONE BUT IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY LIKE ME, BE READY TO PAY BIG BUCK IN REPAIR FOR CHOOSING NOKIA."
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"IF YOU WANT TO MESSED UP YOUR LIFE THEN GO FOR WINDOWS 8 PHONE I THINK PEOPLE SAYING IT'S A GREAT PHONE EITHER UPGRADING FROM BASIC PHONE OR A HARDCORE FAN OF NOKIA OR MOST PROBABLY NOKIA OR MICROSOFT MARKETING PEOPLE AS MOST OF INDIANS ARE OR NEVER EXPERIENCED HIGH END ANDROID AND IPHONE.
      
      
      NO FILE MANAGER FOR WP8 PHONES AND MS SAYING IT'S FOR SECURITY HUH..NO NATIVE GMAIL APP AND YOUTUBE APP HAVING JUST A WRAPPER EXTENDING BROWSER. NO DATA LIMIT OPTION CONSUMES YOUR MOBILE DATA IN A FEW DAYS.NO ZIP FILE VIEWER
      
      YOU CAN'T INSTALL APPLICATION FROM SD CARD OR IF YOU DEVELOP AN APPLICATION AND WANT TEST ON YOUR DEVICE OR WANT TO USE PERSONALLY  THEN YOU NEED TO PURCHASE LICENSE AND SPEND LOT OF BUCKS
      
      AND LOT'S OF OTHER FEATURES WHICH I MISSED FROM MY GALAXY NEXUS AND IPHONE I DON'T THINK IT'S A SMARTPHONE IT'S A CRAP OS FROM MS..AFTER 1 WEEK OF USING I SWITCHED BACK TO MY GALAXY NEXUS AND FEELING HOMELY....GTH MISCROSOFT I HATE U.!!!
      
      IF SOME ONE WANT TO KNOW MORE PROBLEM ABOUT THIS WP8 OS THEN CALL ME ON 9542097247
      
      OR MAIL ME AT NEERAJ.MH99@GMAIL.COM, MY PROFESSION IS MOBILE DEVICE AND APP TESTING. DEVELOPMENT SO I KNOW IT BETTER AND I AM NOT GETTING ANY MONEY TO PROMOTION OR DEMOTION AND IF I AM WRITING SUCH A REVIEW THEN YOU ASSUME I AM REALLY FEELING GUILTY AFTER PURCHASING THIS DEVICE. I AM NOT SAYING IT'S FAULT OF NOKIA DEVICE LOOKS GREAT AND BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD BUT IF YOU ARE POWER USER AND WANT A PHONE TO SIMPLIFY PERSONAL AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL LIFE THEN BIG NO NO TO MICROSOFT WP8 OS"
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"INNOVATIONS ARE THERE IN THIS PHONE BUT PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING A LESSER PRICE. I DO AGREE TO THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE INNOVATIONS ARE GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST LIKE
      
      1. WE HAVE WIRELESS CHARGING ON THIS PHONE BUT YOU CANNOT WORK BY HOLDING THE PHONE IN HAND WHICH IS UNCOMFORTABLE.
      
      2. NOKIA SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR THE APPS STORE TO IMPROVE AND THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE PLANNED TO RELEASE THIS FLAGSHIP PHONE. I JUST SAW ASPHALT 7 FOR RS.55 ON GOOGLE PLAY BUT ON MICROSOFT STORE ITS STILL ASPHALT 5 AT RS.160.
      
      3.CAMERA IS FAR BETTER THAN THE OTHER COMPETITORS BUT LET ME REMIND YOU THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE FOCUS MORE ON CAMERA THAN THE PHONE. NOKIA TRIED TO RELEASE PUREVIEW CAMERA ON 808 BUT IT WAS AN UTTER FLOP."
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"NOKIA LUMIA 920 IS AN EXCELLENT DEVICE BUT WHATS THE POINT WHEN MICROSOFT APP STORE SUCKS.. I VE BEEN USING IPHONE FOR 5 YRS N ANDROID FOR 2 YRS (MA OFFICE PHONE) WITH ATT CONTRACT, I NEED CHANGE.. LUMIA 920 IS CHEAP HERE, ONLY $49 (2700INR) WIT 2YRS CONTRACT &AMP; $449 (24300INR) WITHOUT CONTRACT, I AM REALLY AFRAID TO SWITCH AS I WILL MISS MOST OF MY FAV APPS &AMP; GAMES :("
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"NOKIA N MICROSOFT SHOULD HAVE LOUNCHED THE PHONE WITH A COST EFFECTIVE RANGE. WHEN MANY PEOPLE PREFER ANDROID OVER IPHONE THERE ARE HARDLY VERY FEW DUMB CREATURES WHO WOULD LOVE TO SPEND LIKE THIS MUCH.
      
      
      BEST EXAMPLE GOOGLE NEXUS 4 A YEAR HAS ALMOST PASSED AND WHAT A GREAT HARDWARE COMPARABILITY COMES WITH 2GB RAM AND 1.5 QUAD CORE SNAPDRAGON-
      
      
      NOKIA? PLEASE GROW-UP AND LEAVE WINDOWS OR YOU WILL HAVE ONLY HAVE CLOSED WINDOW EVERYWHERE."
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"ONE WORD FOR PC WINDOW IS GOOD AND FOR MOBILE  ANDROID IS FAR BETTER , REASON FIRST IS U CANT RENAME VIDEO  , IN REPLY WINDOW SAY IS SECURITY ,   MANY DRAWBACK U CANT SEND UR SAVE VIDEO AND HIDE UR VIDEO THEY SAY SECURITY REASON . U CANT EDIT UR REPLY MAIL  THEY SAY SECURITY REASON , CHEAP APPS AVAILABLE ON  APPS STORE  . IOS AND  ANDROID IS FAR BETTER  BB Z 10 IS ALSO GOOD  ,OTHERWISE  WAIT FOR SAILFISH OS . WINDOW OS SAY SECURITY  SECURITY WHAT IS SECURITY  IS JOKE MAIN REASON WINDOW HAVE NOTHING TO DO"
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"STILL 3G....? FOR 37 K..........SAME OLD WINDOWS OS......OTHER BRANDS PRODUCING BETTER THAN THIS OF HALF PRICE OF THIS PHN......!
      
      
      EXPENSIVE.

      POOR APP SELECTION.
      
      BATTERY AVERAGE LIFE.
      
      SOME ISSUES WITH LTE RECEPTION."
Nokia Lumia 920,1,"THIS IS THE HIGH END PHONE FROM NOKIA....WHILE SPENDING MORE THAN 36000 WE EXPECT MORE.
      
      1. BATTERY ONLY 2000 MAH FOR THIS BIG PHONE....VERY POOR...SAME PRICE GALAXY NOTE 2 HAS    3300MAH BATTERY...
      
      2. HEAVY PHONE...185 GM.....SAME MODEL PHONE WEIGHT RANGE IS 130 TO 160 GM ONLY...
      
      3.POOR PROCESSOR...DUAL CORE ONLY...U KNW MOST OF THE SAME RANGE MOBILES HAVE 4 CORE PROCESSORS....
      
      4. POOR RAM 1 GB ONLY....
      
      5. NO CARD SLOT...
      
      6. NO JAVA SUPPORT
      
      ONLY CAMERA ND DISPLAY REACH THE BENCH MARK. WINDOWS 8 YET HAS TO PROVE ALOT WITH ANDROID.....
      
      
      THIS PHONE NEVER VALUABLE FOR 36000RS...YOU WLL GET BETTER SPEC PHONES FRM 28000."
Xperia C,5,A GOOD QUALITY MOBILE AND REALLY AMAZED BY ITS PERFORMANCE. ABLE TO PLAY ALL TYPES OF GAME AND ITS PERFORMANCE IS BETTER THAN SAMSUNG S2 WHICH I HAD EARLIER.

Xperia C,5,"AN EXCELLENT BUY. JUST DOWNLO+ADED THE LATEST ONLINE UPDATE AND HAS  GOTTEN EVEN SMOOTHER. A FEW NAGS, HERE AND THERE BUT NOTHING MUCH TO COMPLAIN. GUESS THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCKS....."
Xperia C,5,"AS EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT SONY`S PRODUCT QUALITY. SO NO NEED TO EXPLAIN ABOUT IT.
      
      THE THING IS FLITKART IS DOING THEIR JOB VERY WELL. I GOT THIS PRODUCT A DAY BEFORE THE FLIPKART`S RELEASED ESTIMATE DATE OF DELIVERY. THE PACKAGING OF FLIPKART IS ALSO GOOD."

      LOVED THE PURPLE COLOR.
      
      
      FINALLY SONY ROCKS :)"
Xperia C,5,"BELIEVE ME GUYS, AFTER USING XPERIA C FOR OVER A MONTH, I MUST SAY THANKS TO SONY FOR LAUNCHING THIS AWESOME PIECE COMBINED WITH BEAUTY AND POWER..
      
      IF YOU WANT A TOP BRANDED PHONE WITH SUPERB STYLISH DESIGN AND DESCENT FEATURES UNDER 20K PRICE, THEN PICK THIS ONE.
      
      
      GOOD THINGS:
      
      
      1)  LOOKS UNIBODY DESIGN(THOUGH IT'S NOT). SLIM. FEELS SO GOOD IN HAND. LIGHT WEIGHT.
      
      2)  NOT ANY TYPE OF SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE PROBLEM AFTER EXTREME USE OF 1 MONTH.
      
      3)  ENOUGH PPI (PIXEL PER INCHES) FOR 5 INCH DISPLAY. [220PPI]
      
      4)  AWESOME WIFI, GPRS, 3G EXPERIENCE. BLAZING FAST WEB SURFING.
      
      5)  SUPPORTS OTG. YOU CAN USE PEN DRIVE. JUST NEED A MICRO USB TO OTG CONNECTOR. [COMES WITHIN RS 150 FROM FLIPKART]
      
      6)  EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY ON BOTH HEADPHONE AND SPEAKER.
      
      7)  SUPPORTS FULL HD PICTURES AND VIDEOS WITH NO LAGS. (GALAXY GRAND DOES NOT)
      
      8)  DUAL SIM FROM SONY. (WHICH IS RARE)
      
      9)  SUPERB BATTERY LIFE [2390 MAH]. ENOUGH JUICE TO LIT UP FOR 2 DAYS WITH MEDIUM USAGE.
      
      10) IT'S SONY.
      
      
      SOME CONSIDERABLE FACTS:
      
      
      1) CAMERA IS AVERAGE BUT NOT BAD.
      
      2) HAS DUAL SIM STAND BY BUT CANNOT RECEIVE CALLS AT SAME TIME.
      
      3) NO NFC FEATURE.
      
      4) LOW INTERNAL STORAGE. 4 GB (1.2 GB AVAILABLE FOR USERS). BUT GOOD THING IS YOU CAN SHIFT ALL APPS AND FILES TO YOUR MICRO SD.
      
      
      THAT'S ALL. IN CONCLUSION, WHEN YOU WILL GO OUT OF YOUR HOME WITH A XPERIA C ON YOUR HAND, OTHER PEOPLE WILL FEEL JEALOUS AND YOU WILL FEEL PROUD FOR SURE...."
Xperia C,5,"BEST MOBILE U CAN GET UNDER 20K
      
      
      MAJOR PROS- BATTERY BACKUP AND SONY U I
      
      ONLY CONS- 1GB INTERNAL MEMORY FOR APPS"
Xperia C,5,"BOUGHT IT ON NOVEMBER 18. AND IT'S SUPERB PHONE.
      
      
      IT'S REALLY A BIG PHONE AND GIVES TOUGH COMPETITION TO SAMSUNG GALAXY PHONES,
      
      I JUST GOT IT
      
      BEST PART IS : ADVANTAGES
      
      1) QUAD CORE PROCESSOR (WHICH SAMSUNG DON'T GIVE IN SUCH LOW PRICE AND WITH BIG SCREEN)
      
      2) FANTASTIC VIDEO QUALITY. FULL HD. BEATING SAMSUNG HD QUALITY. (I ALSO HAVE SAMSUNG QUADRA AND SAMSUNG GRAND DUOS)
      
      3) FANTASTIC PICTURE/PHOTOS QUALITY
      
      4)SUPPORTS ALL HIGH END ANDROID GAMES WITHOUT ANY LAG. NFS MOST WANTED, GTA 4, COD ETC
      
      5) SURPRISINGLY BATTERY LIFE IS MORE THEN I EXPECTED. ON 50% BRIGHTNESS I USED IT FOR 2 DAYS WITH VIDEO SHOOT, PICTURES, PLAYING GAMES ETC.
      
      6) ROBUST PHONE, LOOKS ARE RICH.
      
      7)WIFI/MOBILE DATA SURFING IS FAST.
      
      
      DRAWBACKS:
      
      1) DOESN'T GIVE MUCH MEMORY.HENCE I HAD TO BUY 32 GB MS CARD.
      
      2)FRONT CAMERA IS VGA.
      
      3) YOU NEED TO BE EXTRA CAREFULLY WHY REMOVING IT'S BACK COVER. WATCH IT'S VIDEO HOW TO REMOVE THE BACK COVER ON YOUTUBE WHEN YOU OPEN IT FOR FIRST TIME.
      
      
      ELSE YOU ARE 100% GOOD TO GO FOR THIS PRODUCT. AND IT BEATS MANY OF SAMSUNG AND HTC PHONES.
      
      BUT AVESOME"

Xperia C,5,GUD MOBILE WHILE USING THE MOBILE CHARGING BACKUP IS USEFUL AND SATISFACTORY AND MODEL ALSO BUT I SUGGEST U SONY PEOPLE FOR MOBILE WHILE INSERTING SIM IN THE MOBILE IT IS SOME DIFFICULT PLS RECTIFY IT FOR EASIEST SIM INSERTING
Xperia C,5,"HAVE BEEN A SONY USER FOR LONG AND CAN JUST BET ON THE QUALITY OF PHONES IT HAS DOLED OUT.
      
      THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT IS BEST SUITED IN ITS PRICE RANGE , HAS THE WELL LIT SONY DISPLAY WHICH MAKES WATCHING MOVIES ON IT THAT MUCH MORE EXCITING ,IS PROMPT AND FAST THANKS TO ITS FAST PROCESSOR ,  WORKS SMOOTH WITH MANY APPS RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND, AND BATTERY IS ALSO GOOD WITH MY EXHAUSTIVE USAGE IT STILL IS POWERED FOR A WHOLE DAY !!

Xperia C,5,"HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW AND HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED A SINGLE DRAWBACK. MUSIC QUALITY, WIFI STRENGTH IS GOOD AND BATTERY LIFE IS AVERAGE ALTHOUGH BUT I GUESS THIS IS AN ISSUE TO ALL OF THE ANDROID BASED PHONES. GAMING EXPERIENCE ON BASIC GAMES IS GOOD ENOUGH ALTHOUGH THE HIGH END IS NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE. OVERALL BANG FOR THE BUCK!"
Xperia C,5,"HELLO, I HAVE JUST PURCHASED IT A WEEK BEFORE. FIRSTLY I PREFERRED TO BUY GALAXY GRAND DUOS BUT THE DESIGN AND EXTENSIVE CONFIGURATION HAS CHANGED MY MIND.
      
      
      I MUST SAY THE BATTERY BACK UP IS JUST EXCELLENT. AFTER CHARGING ONCE, IT LASTS FOR AT LEAST 36 HRS ON 3G NETWORK.
      
      
      THE PROCESSOR IS ALSO PERFORMING VERY WELL, MANY PLAY STORE GAMES ARE SUPPORTED.
      
      
      THE VISUALIZATION TOO IS VERY EYE CATCHY.
      
      
      THE MUSIC LOUDNESS ON SPEAKER VOLUME IS DECREASED IN COMPARISON WITH SONY ERICSSON MOBILES. AT LEAST 25% LESS LOUDNESS IS THERE. THE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT. IN HEADPHONES THE QUALITY IS SAME AS SONY ERICSSON.
      
      
      I WOULD PREFER TO GO AHEAD AND BUY IF YOUR BUDGET IS RANGING UPTO 18K. THE BEST PHONE IN THIS CATEGORY."
Xperia C,5,"HI MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE PRODUCT AND THE RETAILER HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT..ON TIME DELIVERY AND FLEXIBILITY..SO FAR THE PRODUCT IS PERFORMING FLAWLESS.
      
      
      THANKS
      
      ANANT"
Xperia C,5,I AM HAPPY  WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF XPERIA C. I GOT THIS FROM FLIPKART FOR 17500 RS . NO LAGGING COMPARED TO SAMSUNG GRAND . BUT IN SPECIFICATION THEY SHOWN 4 GB INTERNAL MEMORY BUT ACTUALLY  THE PHONE HAVING ONLY 1GB INTERNAL MEMORY. I DONT KNOW WHY THIS HAPPEND.? ANY WAY PHONE IS WORKING SMOOTHLY. THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR TIMELY DELIVERY
Xperia C,5,I AM VERY HAPPY WITH FLIPKART DELIVERY. RECIEVED THE PHONE IN JUST 2 DAYS. BATTERY LIFE OF THE PHONE IS VERY GOOD. NICE PHONE AT THIS PRICE RANGE.
Xperia C,5,"I AM VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.
      
      IT IS WORTH BUYING, INSTEAD OF SAMSUNG GRAND YOU SHOULD GO WITH THIS PRODUCT."
Xperia C,5,I BOUGHT SONY EXPERIA C. ARRIVED WITHING EXPECTED DELIEVERY DATE WITH GOOD PACKING AND ENJOYING USING CELL PHONE TOO. ONE MINOR NEGATIVE THING IS THAT THE GREETING SENT ALONG WITH PHONE WAS OF VERY BAD QUALITY
Xperia C,5,"I BOUGHT THIS IN DEC 2013, AND IT IS THE MOST AWESOME PHONE I HAVE USED SO FAR. THE BEST FEATURE AS COMPARED TO SAMSUNG(S)(I WAS USING EARLIER), IT NEVER HANGS UP ON ME LOL.
      
      NAVIGATION, PICTURE QUALITY, LOOKS, SOUND.. EVERYTHING IS AMAZING AND THAT TOO AT A REASONABLE PRICE."
Xperia C,5,I BROUGHT THIS PHONE 20 DAYS BACK.IT IS AWESOME.LOOK IS ALSO VERY GOOD.AND TILL NOW NO PERFORMANCE ISSUE CAME LIKE SLOW PROCESSING ETC.I AM LOVING IT.
Xperia C,5,"I FIRST THOUGHT OF BUYING SONY XPERIA L ,BUT THEN AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE REVIEWS I DECIDED TO PURCHASE XPERIA C AND BOY WHAT A PHONE THIS IS.
      
      
      PROS- 5 INCH SCREEN GIVES YOU REAL GOOD FEEL,QUAD CORE PROCESSOR IS A POSTIVE ,EXCELLENT CAMERA QUALITY,GOOD BATTERY LIFE.
      
      
      CONS - A SLIGHT ISSUE REGARDING INTERNAL MEMORY ,BUT CAN BE TRANSFERRED INTO EXTERNAL MEMORY,NOT A PHONE FOR HEAVY HEAVY GAMER.
      
      
      CONCLUSION:-  BEST PHONE IN 20K RANGE."
Xperia C,5,"I HAVE PURCHASED MORE THAN 100 MOBILES BUT SONY XPERIA C IS EXCELLENT, SPEED &AMP; SOUND IS EXCELLENT.
      
      
      I HAVE PURCHASED MORE THAN 100 MOBILES BUT SONY XPERIA C IS EXCELLENT, SPEED &AMP; SOUND IS EXCELLENT."
Xperia C,5,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE ON 20 FEB 2014
      
      
      LOOK IS GOOD..
      
      
      BUT CAMERA QUALITY ONLY 3 MP. SONY IS SAYING 8 MP...IN NIGHT CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY BAD...
      
      
      FRONT CAMERA IS VERY VERY BAD....
      
      
      ONLY ONE SIM SUPPORT 3G...
      
      
      SO PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PHONE...
      
      
      NOT SUPPORT OTG"
Xperia C,5,"I PURCHASE SONY XPERIA C (PURPLE) FOR MY SISTER AS HER BIRTHDAY GIFT AND CHERISHED HER. VERY HAPPY WITH THE DEVICE, BRAND NEW, WORKING FINE, MY FIRST ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. REALLY HAPPY WITH FLIPKART AND THE SELLER. NICE PACKING, COMMITTED DELIVERY. SHOPPING LOTS ON FLIPKART"
Xperia C,5,"I PURCHASE THIS PHONE 1 MONTH AGO THROUGH PLIFKART.NICE SLIM DESIGN AND STYLISH LOOK. IN ONE WORD THIS IS AWESOME PHONE ACCORDING TO HIS PERFORMANCE IN THIS RANGE .
      
      1. BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY GOOD.
      
      2. MOVIE EXPERIENCE IS BETTER(1080P VIDEO PLAY SMOOTHLY )
      
      3. PLAY ANY GAME WITHOUT ANY DISTURBANCE .
      
      4. PHOTO QUALITY IS AWESOME IN DAY LIGHT, BUT BIT DOWN IN FLASH LIGHT.
      
      
      IF COMPARE WITH GALAXY GRAND, SONY XPERIA C IS FAR BETTER THEN GALAXY GRAND.
      
      THIS REVIEW IS MY OWN EXPERIENCE."
Xperia C,5,"I WANTED TO BUY THE PHONE IN THE RANGE OF 15-20 K, AND FOUND JUST THE RIGHT PHONE. THE PHONE IS GREAT IN THIS RANGE.
      
      
      EVERYTHING IS GREAT BUT ONE THING. AUDIO OUTPUT WHILE WATCHING THE VIDEOS IS LESS. WHILE LISTENING THE SONGS ITS GOOD. BUT FOR THIS DISADVANTAGE, I JUST BOUGHT SONY MH-750 HEADPHONE AND PROBLEM SOLVED.
      
      
      SO GO FOR IT."
Xperia C,5,"I WAS A OUT AND OUT SONY USER IN THE PRE-SMART PHONE ERA. GOT ONE OF THE EARLY VERSIONS OF XPERIA 2 YEARS BACK AND WAS DISAPPOINTED AND MOVED TO SAMSUNG GALAXY. WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT - OVER A PERIOD OF TIME &AMP; I AM GLAD THAT I CAME BACK TO SONY AGAIN. XPERIA C IS SERIOUS VALUE FOR MONEY !!. AT 18K ON FLIPKART, IT IS A GREAT DEAL !. THE PHONE IS SUPER FAST, NO HANGS SO FAR, CAN TOGGLE BETWEEN 4 TO 6 APPLICATIONS LIKE HOW I DO ON MY LAPTOP. WONDERFUL SOUND AND MUSIC QUALITY TOO. PHOTOGRAPHS ARE VERY GOOD TOO. SO ALL IN ALL, GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY !. ONE OF THE BEST PHONES FROM SONY."
Xperia C,5,IAM USING THIS MOBILE FROM 1 MONTH AND I WANT TO SAY BEST MOBILE IN 17K RANGE. BETTER THAN GRAND 2. GUYS NO TIME TO PLAY GAMES SO FOR ME BEST MOBILE.
Xperia C,5,"IF YOU WANT TO SPENT 17-18K FOR A SMART PHONE, DON'T THINK SO MUCH JUST GO FOR IT. AMAZING PRODUCT NO LAGGING ISSUES. ONLY ONE PROBLEM BATTERY DRAIN VERY FAST AFTER 30% TO 13%. MAY BE THIS PROBLEM IS SORTED OUT BY THE NEXT UPDATE...!!! OTHERWISE AMAZING PHONE..!!!"
Xperia C,5,IF YOUR BUDGET IS UNDER 20K THEN THIS PHONE IS THE BEST I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2M ONTHS AGO AND STILL DINT FACE ANY PROBLEM ITS JSU SIMPLY TAHT AWESOME.ITS GRAPHICS ARE ALSO COOL AND SONY APP LIEK SONY TV SONY CONNECT MAKE IT MUCH MORE EASIER AND BETTER TO USE...
Xperia C,5,"IN THIS RANGE THIS ONE IS EXCELLENT MOBILE.
      
      BATTERY BACK UP, CAMERA CLARITY, AND SOUND IS VERY GOOD.
      
      THIS PHONE IS IN LIGHT WEIGHT."
Xperia C,5,"INITIALLY I THOUGHT OF BUYING LENOVO P780 AS ITS CHEAP, BUT SURPRISINGLY SONY HAS THIS DEVICE WITH SAME SPECS EVEN BETTER SPEC(EXCEPT BATTERY) AT ALMOST SIMILAR PRICE. I AM TOTALLY SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE FOR ITS PRICE AND FEATURES AVAILABLE. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY A 5 INCH PHONE AT BUDGET PRICE."
Xperia C,5,ITS AWESOME...... FLIPKART IS THE BEST ONLINE STORE. IT SELLS THE GENUINE AND ORIGINAL PRODUCT. I LOVE THIS SONY XPERIA C PURPLE MOBILE AND I GOT FREE GIFT TOO.
Xperia C,5,"ITS JUST AN AWESOME PHONE.
      
      NO LAG, FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE
      
      PEOPLE WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT MEDIATEK PROCESSOR I DON'T CHALLENGE THEIR COMMENTS BUT XPERIA C DOESN'T WORTH OF THEIR COMMENTS. I PERSONALLY PLAYS MANY HD GAMES ON THIS PHONE UPTO SIZE 1GB BUT IT DO NOT SHOW ANY LAG.
      
      OTHER THINGS LIKE DISPLAY, SOUND, CAMERA IS BEST AT ITS PRICE. I TASTE ITS DISPLAY WITH S3 BUT I MUST SAY SAMSUNG YOU CAN ONLY PROVIDE TOO MANY FEATURES IN LOWEST PRICE BUT ATLEAST MAINTAIN PRODUCT QUALITY. ALTHOUGH S3 IS A BIG BUDGET PHONE AT ITS LAUNCH TIME AND HAVE FULL HD DISPLAY BUT XPERIA C (QHD) IS TOP OF IT.
      
      WALKMAN IS A TRADEMARK OF SONY. NO WORDS TO SAY ABOUT IT, WE ALL KNOW....
      
      CAMERA IS LITTLE SLOW AND YOU MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME TO HANDY WITH IT. BUT IMAGE QUALITY IS TOO GOOD IN THIS RANGE.
      
      
      MOST IMPORTANT THING OF A PHONE IS ITS BATTERY. WHAT A BATTERY PERFORMANCE FOR THIS PHONE. FULLY CHARGED PHONE WITH MODERATE USES MINIMUM 36HRS - 40HRS ,,,,, GREAT GREAT JUST LOVE THIS... NO TENSION FOR CHARGING FOR A SHORT OUTING....
      
      
      OVERALL I CAN GUARANTEE NO ONE WILL REDEMP BUYING THIS PHONE AT ANY MOMENT AT ANY COST, AND MOST OF ALL I WILL BE YOUR STYLE STATEMENT TOO UNLIKE BORING, COMMON, CHIP, SAMSUNG."
Xperia C,5,JUST GO FOR IT..THIS PHONE IS AWESOME...SONY AT ITS BEST...ITS VERY FAST..I THINK YOU WILL BE PROUD OF THIS MOBILE...
Xperia C,5,"LIKE THE PRODUCT,THE PACKING WAS AWESOME THANKS TO THE SELLER AND FLIPKART,WANT TO BUY MORE PRODUCTS FROM FLIPKART IF THEY CONTINUE TO GIVE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AT A GREAT DISCOUNT.I WANT  THIS SELLER TO GIVE OFFERS TO US EVERYTIME ,THANKSS WS RETAIL.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND DO ALWAYS PROVIDE GENUINE PRODUCT AS ALWAYS.THANKSSSSSSSSS"
Xperia C,5,"MY TAKE ON THIS PURCHASE &AMP; THE PHONE:
      
      1. WS RETAIL &AMP; FIPKART ARE VERY PROMPT  &AMP; DEEPLY THANKFUL &AMP; TRUSTWORTHY.
      
      
      2. THE PHONE IS GOOD IN ALL ASPECTS. BETTER THAN ITS GALAXY RANGES. I ONLY WISH IF THE LOUDSPEAKER IS AS LOUD AS THOSE OF NOKIA PHONE.  BUT ITS SOUND IS BETTER IN ITS QUALITY (XLOUD/SURROUND) WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN GALAXY &AMP; NOKIA.
      
      
      3. DO NOT COMPARE WITH MMX,KARBONN,LAVA BUT U CAN COMPARE WITH SAMSUNG (NOT NOKIA). I LIKE SONY MUCH MORE. MMX,KARBONN,LAVA ARE MUCH CHEAPER BUT BATTERY, CAMERA, SOUND ARE NOT UPTO THE FIGURE OF THE SPECIFICATION MAH, MEGAPIXEL, DB (YOU HAVE TO CUTDOWN 50% IN ITS REALITY RESULT). I DONT KNOW WHY THE SAME PHONE SIZE, SAME MAH, SAME MEGAPIXEL OF (MMX,KARBONN, LAVA) AND (SONY/SAMSUNG/NOKIA) DIFFER BY MANY HOURS IN ITS LASTING, TOO MUCH DIFFER BY FLASH &AMP; IMAGE RESULT UNDER DAYLIGHT &AMP; NIGHT.
      
      
      4. I AM SATISFIED TO HAVE THIS PHONE; NOT REGRET."
Xperia C,5,"NICE HANDSET, GOOD FEATURES,VERY HANDY, GOOD BATTERY LIFE, VERY SATISFIED BY THE PERFORMANCE.
      
      VERY GOOD SERVICE FROM FLIPKART, THE DELIVERY WAS MADE BEFORE THE PROMISED DATE. FLIPKART HAS MADE ONLINE SHOPPING A GOOD EXPERIENCE, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
Xperia C,5,NICE ITEM WITH NICE RATE. FREE HEADPHONE RECEIVED HAS VERY GOOD QUALITY..........................................................
Xperia C,5,"NO WORDS TO SAY ABOUT SONY. I JUST SUGGEST THE BUYERS OF SONY XPERIA C, TO GET THE LATEST UPDATE FROM SONY UPDATE SERVICE. OTHERWISE THE MOBILE GET RESTARTED WHEN WE USE LOCATION SERVICES (GOOGLE MAPS) WHEN WE ARE IN ROAMING. SO UPDATE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. THE LATEST SOFTWARE UPDATE AVAILALE FOR XPERIA C TILL-DATE IS 16.0.B.0.21."
Xperia C,5,"OVERALL A GOOD PHONE.... I HAVE PURCHASED 4 SONY XPERIA C FROM FLIPKART AND ENLISTING MY VIEWS....
      
      
      1) BUILD QUALITY IS GOOD EXCEPT THE BACK COVER, HARD TO REMOVE AND FEELS DELICATE.
      
      2) CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS, IMAGES BLUR AT LOW LIGHTS EVEN AT OUTDOOR.
      
      3) SCREEN CLARITY IS AWESOME, PLAYS UNINTERRUPTED HD VIDEOS..
      
      4) HAS WCDMA/GSM OPTION FOR SIM 1 ONLY... CAN NOT SWITCH 3G NETWORK FROM ONE SIM TO ANOTHER.
      
      5) FREE BIG HEADPHONES ARE AWESOME WITH GRAET QUALITY SOUND OUTPUT, SMALL HEADPHONES ARE OK
      
      (CAPSULE HEADPHONES COULD BE BETTER..)
      
      6) BATTERY DRAINS QUICKLY... 1 DAY BACKUP.
      
      7) UPDATE IS GIVEN BY SONY AS 16.0.B.2.6 BUT NO UPGRADATION IN ANDROID VERSION, KEPT SAME AS 4.2.2,
      
      HOPE UPGRADE TO KITKAT WILL BE GIVEN SOON, AS THE COMPETITORS LIKE MOTO G ARE GIVING IT AT A LOWER
      
      PRICE.
      
      8) BUILT IN MEMORY IS LOW - USER AVAILABLE IS 0.98GB, STILL NO PROBLEM AS THE APPS CAN BE MOVED TO
      
      SD CARD.
      
      9) FRONT CAMERA IS OF POOR QUALITY, MIGHT BE DESIGNED TO USE LOW DATA USAGE DURING VIDEO CALLING.
      
      10) LIGHT IN WEIGHT, EASY TO CARRY BUT A BIT BIG TO HANDLE SPECIALLY WHEN USING A FLIP COVER.
      
      11) GRAPHICS ARE SMOOTH WHEN PLAYING GAMES LIKE ANIMAL ESCAPE, TEMPLE RUN ETC.
      
      12) WALLPAPER LOVERS CAN NOT USE ANY PHOTO DIRECTLY AS WALLPAPER, EVERY PIC NEEDS TO BE CROPPED FOR
      
      USING AS WALLPAPER.
      
      13) DEVICE CAN NOT BE RESTARTED, THE ONLY OPTION IS TO SWITCH OFF AND ON BY POWER BUTTON..
      
      14) CAMERA BUTTON, POWER BUTTON ARE GIVEN ON PERIPHERAL SIDE OF BACK COVER, NEEDS CARE DURING
      
      REMOVING THE BACK COVER..
      
      15) GOOD PARTS ARE SERVICE FROM FLIPKART, EKART LOGISTICS, WS RETAIL (ONLY STORE GIVING 30 DAYS REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE), FREE SONY HEADPHONES, FREE ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE PROTECTION FOR 6 MONTHS.
      
      
      RECOMMENDED FOR QUALITY USERS..."
Xperia C,5,"PEOPLE WHO ARE LIMITED TO LISTEN TO MUSIC, WATCH VIDEOS, READ BOOKS AND MESSAGING, THIS WOULD BEST BUY.
      
      PHONE CAN EVEN PLAY HIGH END GAMES IN MEDIUM SETTINGS. 5 INCH SCREEN IS JUST GOOD FOR READING BOOKS AND WATCHING MOVIES.........."
Xperia C,5,PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME IF WE GET 6 MONTHS ACCIDENTAL WARRANTY ALSO VIA PRODUCT DELIVERED THROUGH FLIPKART.....

Xperia C,5,THE PHONE WAS AWESOME. ITS HAVING MORE PERFORMANCE WHEN COMPARED WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND I9082.THE BATTERY WAS GUD VTH THIS KIND OF PHONE.
Xperia C,5,"THIS IS A MIDDLE BUDGET PHONE IT SHOULDNT BE 20... MUST BE AROUND 16-17 ..CAMERA QUALITY IS TOO GOOD AND THE PROCESSOR IS QUITE FAST.. I JUST DONT LIKE THE INTERNAL SPACE WHICH IS JUST 4 GB IN THIS PHONE THATS REALLY A DRAW BACK ..THE 5"" TOUCH SCREEN IS SHARP AND SONY PROVES TO BE A BRAND NAME..
      
      
      PROS : 5 INCH DISPLAY 8 MP CAMERA QUAD CORE PROCESSOR WITH 1 GB RAM
      
      
      CONS : 4 GB INTERNAL MEMORY , PRICE TOO HIGH , 0.3 MP FRONT FACING CAMERA , CHEAP MEDIATEK PROCESSOR
      
      
      ***** WS RETAIL &AMP; FIPKART ARE VERY PROMPT &AMP; DEEPLY THANKFUL &AMP; TRUSTWORTHY.****"
Xperia C,5,THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE AMAZING SONY PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE RANGE..I HAVE TRIED MY HANDS ON ALL HIGH END PHONES ..BE IT APPLE 5..SAMSUNG NOTE 2....BUT THIS IS EQUALLY SUPERB IN HALF THE PRICE..I WOULD DEFO RECOMMEND IT
Xperia C,5,"THIS IS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD, ON TIME  DELIVERY (2 DAYS).AS WELL THE PRODUCT AS MENTIONED. MORE OVER I GOT THE CASH BACK ON MY CREDIT CARD WITHOUT CALLING THEN AGAIN AND AGAIN."
Xperia C,5,"THIS IS PHONE HAS GOOD HARDWARE, BUT SCREEN RESOLUTION IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. FLIPKART IS VERY GOOD AS ALWAYS FAST DELIVERY AND PACKING WAS ALSO GREAT."
Xperia C,5,THIS PHONE IS GREAT IN TERMS OF FEATURES AND LOOKS. DID SOME RESEARCH IN THE MARKET / NET ABOUT THE PRICING AND FLIPKART  DEAL IS THE BEST.
Xperia C,5,"WAS VERY CONVINCED OF THE MODEL &AMP; MAKE SO WON'T DISCUSS ABOUT THAT. YOU'D BE SURPRISED THAT I HAVE ORDER 2 NOS. FROM FLIPKART IN A MATTER OF A MONTH. THE SERVICE RENDERED WAS IMPECCABLE. I'D BE VERY CAUTIOUS WHILE HANDLING ONLINE PURCHASES OF SUCH HIGH VALUE. BUT FLIPKART REALLY BROKE THAT MYTH FOR ME CUZ OF WHICH I WENT IN FOR THE 2ND PIECE TOO FROM THEM. SONY BEING A REPUTED COMPANY ALSO AGREES TO PASS ON WARRANTY IN CASE OF ANY DIFFICULTY.
      
      THE RETAILER WS RETAIL HAS VERY GOOD REPUTE &AMP; THE PACKING AND FAST SERVICE PROVIDED BY FLIPKART IS TRULY COMMENDABLE. VERY HAPPY BUYER."
Xperia C,5,"WHEN SUPPOSED TO BE RECEIVED BY 7:00PM ON 31ST JAN, THE ORDER HAS BEEN DELAYED. AFTER HAVING AVAILED ""IN-A-DAY GUARANTEE"" THE ORDER SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DELAYED. NOW IT DEPENDS ON THE PRODUCT THAT WE RECEIVE IF IN PROPER CONDITION OR NOT.
      
      
      UPDATE: RIGHT AFTER I POSTED THIS REVIEW, I RECEIVED A CALL REGARDING THE ACTUAL ADDRESS OF DELIVERY. RATING IT POSITIVELY."
Xperia C,4,"1ST OF ALL FLIPCART IS AMAZING ! DELIVERY &AMP; SERVICE ABOVE EXPECTATIONS ! THANK U FLIPCART !
      
      IN THIS PRICE RANGE, THIS IS THE BEST PHONE COMPARE TO ALL OTHER BRANDS &AMP; SPECIFICATIONS.
      
      
      GOT  ISSUE IN MY PHONE, WHILE TALKING, SCREEN WAS SUDDENLY OFF &AMP; NOT ABLE TO RETRIEVE IT. WOULD BE PROXIMITY SENSOR ISSUE OR SOFTWARE PROBLEM MIGHT BE THERE.
      
      TWICE  TALKED TO FLIPCART, THEY IMMEDIATELY REPLACED IT WITH NEW ONE WITHIN 2 DAYS.
      
      
      USING NEW PHONE  SINCE LAST 10 DAYS &AMP; WORKING GREAT. QHD WITH AMAZING CLARITY.NO ISSUE AT ALL.
      
      
      WITH THIS BUDGET U CAN DEFINATELY GO WITH THIS PHONE."
Xperia C,4,"25 DAYS BACK I BOUGHT IT IN RS. 17989/- FROM FLIPKART (WITH FREE HEADPHONE). THOUGH MANY OF USERS ALREADY WROTE A LOT ABOUT IT. SOME AWESOME FACTS ARE THERE:
      
      1. VERY VERY GOOD DISPLAY, PLAYS HD VIDEOS VERY SHARPLY N SMOOTHLY.
      
      2. NFS, FAST N FURIOUS TYPE HEAVY GAMES CAN BE PLAYED WITHOUT ANY LAG N ANY ISSUE.
      
      3. GOOD SOUND QUALITY.
      
      
      THE ONLY DRAWBACK THAT I FELT IN IT .. WHENEVER I REBOOT IT, ALL DESIRED SHORTCUTS PLACED ON DESKTOP WILL DISAPPEAR AUTOMATICALLY AND SECOND IN ANY ANDROID IS BEING 1GB RAM. THOUGH YOU CAN DOWNLOAD A LOT OF APPS IN SD CARD BUT IT ALSO CONSUMES MEMORY.
      
      
      PLEEZZZZEEEE GUYS DO NOT INSTALL ANY CACHE CLEANER LYK CLEAN MASTER ETC. THESE CONSUMES MORE RAM, WHEN I RESET MY PHONE N DIDN'T INSTALL IT, I DO NOT HAVE ANY ISSUE REGARDING 'LOW SPACE' OR MEMORY. GO FOR IT OTHERWISE."
Xperia C,4,A GOOD PHONE ESPECIALLY FROM SONY AT THIS RATE. THE CAMERA QUALITY IS GUD AND SO IS THE SOUND. A GUD PHONE TO BUY.
Xperia C,4,"A WONDERFUL MOBILE HANDSET WITH RICH FEATURES. CAMERA FEATURES ARE PERHAPS ARE INFERIOR TO NOKIA LUMIA 720.
      
      HATS OFF TO FLIP CART TO MAKE AVAILABLE THIS SET TO ME WITH 10% CASH BACK OFFER ON HDFC DEBIT/CREDIT CARD. PLEASE NOTE THAT 10% CASH BACK IS NOT YET RECEIVED.
      
      THANKS AGAIN."
Xperia C,4,"AN UPDATE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR XPERIA C WHICH UPDATES THE BUILD NUMBER FROM 16.0.B.0.21 TO 16.0.B.2.6
      
      
      THE ANDROID VERSION IS STILL 4.2.2
      
      
      THE UPDATE NOT AVAILABLE OTA SO YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THE PHONE VIA USB AND UPDATE IT FROM THE SONY PC COMPANION.
      
      
      AFTER THE UPDATE:
      
      - SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF APPS DISAPPEARING FROM THE HOME SCREEN ON REBOOT.
      
      - SOME MINOR CAMERA AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS.
      
      - THE BATTERY DRAIN FROM 30% TO 2% HAS MARGINALLY IMPROVED.
      
      - INTERNAL MEMORY ISSUE STILL PERSISTS.
      
      - LOW VOLUME VIA HEADPHONE JACK HAS MARGINALLY IMPROVED.
      
      
      HOPE SONY ISSUES A KITKAT UPDATE SOON."
Xperia C,4,EVERYTHING IS AWESOME EXCEPT THE CAMERA CLARITY. NEVER EXPECTED SUCH A WORST IMAGES FROM SONY HANDSET'S CAMERA. NOT AT ALL SUITABLE FOR CAPTURING THE MOVING PICTURES. I WOULD HAVE RATE 5 IF CAMERA WAS ALSO OF BETTER QUALITY.
Xperia C,4,"FIRST OF ALL.... I GOT A FAULTY PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART. BUT FLIPKART COORDINATED VERY WELL FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      SONY XPERIA C
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. GOOD BUDGET PRODUCT WITH THE MODERATE PRICE.
      
      2. SONY HAS MAINTAINED ITS AUDIO AND VIDEO QUALITY
      
      3. PERFORMANCE WISE ALSO ITS VERY GOOD.
      
      4. VERY GOOD BATTERY BACKUP
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. SOME ISSUES W.R.T TO MOBILE SOFTWARE, HOPE IT WILL BE RESOLVED AFTER SOFTWARE UPDATES."
Xperia C,4,GOOD BATTERY BACK UP.. CAMERA QUALITY IS EXCELLENT .. SUPPORTING FULL HD BLUERAY FILMS.. I'M USING IT SINCE NEW YEAR. AWESOME DISPLAY..WIFI SIGNAL RANGE IS TOO GOOD..GAMES RUN WITHOUT HANGING... CONS IS NO SOUND QUALITY..
Xperia C,4,"GOOD EXPERINCE WITH THE PRODUCT. HOWEVER, THE CHARGER WAS NOT WORKING FROM THE 2ND CHARGING ONWARDS. EVEN THOUGH ANDROID PROVIDES LOTS OF CUSTOMER FRIENDLY OPTIONS. IT SEEMS, SONY IS NOT INTERESTED IN EXTENDING THEM. IN COMPARISION TO HTC AND SAMSUNG I USED, I FIND THE OPTIONS AGAINST ANY BASIC FEATURES LIKE EMAIL OPTIONS, CONTACT OPTIONS ARE LESS."
Xperia C,4,"GOOD FEATURE PHONE EVERY THING IS GOOD
      
      AT THIS AMOUNT BEST CAMARE QUALITY AND SOUND . HAVE GOOD DISPLAY"
Xperia C,4,"GOOD MOB WITH LOTS OF FEATURES. THE BUILT QUALITY IS OSSOM!!!

Xperia C,4,"GOOD PRODUCT, NICE PHONE, LONG BATTERY LIFE...GOOD PLAYBACK TIME AND VALUE FOR MONEY. I LIKE THE PHONE VERY MUCH. AWESOME PHONE IN ITS CLASS"
Xperia C,4,"GOT MY XPERIA TODAY, THANX FLIPKART FOR THE SAFE AND NEAT DELIVERY .THE BATTERY LIFE IS PAKKA . ONLY PROBLEM I NOTICED IS THAT WHEN COMPARED TO MY LAST PHONE( XPERIA P )DISPLAY QUALITY IS POOR  .. ELSE THE PHONE IS WORTH BUYING .."
Xperia C,4,"GOT THIS PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART. TILL NOW IT HAS BEEN A SATISFACTORY PRODUCT.
      
      1) PERFORMANCE: DECENT PERFORMANCE WHEN MULTITASKING. GOOD DOWNLOADING SPEEDS ON WIFI.
      
      2) SCREEN SIZE IS A BIG ADVANTAGE. GOOD FOR PIC VIEWING AND NAVIGATION.
      
      3) CAMERA: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, IF YOU WANT TO USE IT AS UR PRIMARY SHOOTING DEVICE. CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT GOOD. RECORDING IS OK.
      
      4) OVERALL, GOOD ENTRY LEVEL 6 INCH PHONE, UNLESS IF YOU DO NOT FANCY TOO MUCH ABOUT SMART PHONE, THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE. STANDS APART FROM SAMSUNG CROWD. :)"
Xperia C,4,"GREAT DISPLAY! FEELS LIKE A HD DISPLAY.
      
      
      SMOOTH PERFORMANCE, NO STALLING!
      
      
      RESEMBLES WITH XPERIA Z THAT GIVES RICH FEELING.

Xperia C,4,"GUYS..I'M USING DIS PHONE FOR LAST FEW DAYS..IT'S REALLY AMAZING..DISPLAY,BUILD QUALITY,CAMERA EXCELLENT..ALL FEATURES ARE SUPER CLASS..2 ME ONE PROBLEM WHICH I FACE IS MICRO SIM..NOWADAYS IT'S GROOMING IN UPCOMING MOBILE..SO IT'S NOT A ISSUE..RATHER PHONE SEEMS NICE..PRETTY LOOKS..NO HEAT DURING RUNNING TIME..&AMP; SOUND IS JUST SUPERB..SO GO FOR IT COMPARISON TO GRAND..OTHERS ALSO GET FULL REVIEW..I JUST SUGGEST IT.."
Xperia C,4,"HI FRNDS AM USING THIS PHONE FROM THE PAST 50 DAYS, THIS IS A EXCELLENT PHONE AND SLIM
      
      THE BATTERY BACKUP OF THIS MOBILE IS AWESOME. THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE OF THIS MOBILE IS CAMERA LAGGING, INTERNAL STORAGE IS 4GB IN THAT U'LL GET AROUND 1GB USER AVAILABLE AND FOR GAMING PURPOSE THIS PHONE IS TOO GOOD, THIS MOBILE CAN PLAY ANY HIGH RESOLUTION GAME BUT THIS PHONE GETS HEAT WHEN U PLAY GAMES AND IT WILL GET COOLDOWN SO FAST  .
      
      AND THE LAST THING IS THAT DELIVERY AND RESPONSE OF FLIPKART IS TOO GOOD...
      
      FOR THE FLIPKART WE CAN GIVE 5 STARS FOR THEIR GUD RESPONSE"
Xperia C,4,"HI
      
      IAM USSING THIS PHONE FROM 3DAYS , BATTRY IS V.GOOD , SCREEN GD , CAMARA IS GOOD , BUT ONLY BIG PROBLEM IS YOU CANT SEND NAMES AND NUMBERS IN MSG ? WHEN I TRYD IT , WILL BE CONVERTED TO MMS !!!! YOU JUST CANT COY NUMBRS IN A CONTACTS AND PEST IT IN MSG BOX I THIMK THIS IS MAIN DISADVANTAGE ..........ONE GD THING IS YOU CAN MOVE APPS TO SD CARD ."
Xperia C,4,"HI,
      
      
      I AM USING SONY EXPERIA C SINCE 3 MONTH. TILL NOW THERE IS NO ISSUE.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE WISE ITS TOO GOOD. I HAVE DOWNLOADED SOME HEAVY GAMES, THAT RUNS VERY SMOOTHLY.
      
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      
      ONLY ISSUE IS , THERE NO PROPER CAMERA COVER (FLIP COVER) AVAILABLE.
      
      
      REGARDS,
      
      ANEESH"
Xperia C,4,"I BOUGHT IT FROM A LOCAL SHOPKEEPER, AS I WAS GETTING IT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE OF 17100, WITH 1 YEAR SONY WARRANTY. IN THE PAST I HAD BOUGHT GALAXY S2. I WANTED TO UPGRADE TO A 5"" PHABLET, BUT COULDN'T FIND ANY SUCH DEVICE WITH GOOD BATTERY BACKUP.
      
      
      ALTHOUGH THE DISPLAY IS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE SUPER AMOLED PLUS IN S2, S3 ETC, BUT IT ISN'T BAD AT ALL. IN FACT, NOW I THINK THE AMOLED SCREEN HAVE HIGH COLOR SATURATION, AND I HAD GOT USED TO THOSE! THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS DECENT ENOUGH TO PLAY ALL HD GAMES, WATCH HD VIDEOS ETC. I AM NOT A CRAZY FAN OF FULL HD ON MOBILE PHONE, I MEAN MOST OF THE TIMES I USE IT FOR CALLING, BROWSING, GOOGLE MAPS, NOTES, AND GAMING, AND THE RESOLUTION OF XPERIA C IS SUFFICIENT FOR ALL THOSE. ALSO ALL THE PHONES WITH FULL HD (OR QHD) HAVE LOW BATTERY BACKUP. WHEREAS MY PHONE LASTS 2 DAYS EASILY, AND WHEN I TURN ON STAMINA MODE, IT LASTS FOR 3-3.5 DAYS EASILY!!! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR ME IN ANY MOBILE DEVICE.
      
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT A PURPLE COLORED PHONE, AND COULDN'T BE HAPPIER CUZ ITS FUNKY AND STILL DOESN'T LOOK GIRLY AT ALL! LOT OF ILLITERATE PEOPLE WHO OWN GALAXY S4, NOTE3 APPRECIATE MY PHONE'S LOOKS, AND ONE GUY EVEN TOLD ME TO EXCHANGE IT!!! BUT IF I WANTED THOSE, I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THEM MYSELF! BTW THESE PPL WERE SO STUPID, THAT EVEN WHEN I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THEM THAT THEIR NOTE3, S4 ARE TOO GOOD IN PROCESSOR, DISPLAY, RAM ETC, THEY WOULD STILL PLACE LOOKS OVER MATTER! AND I TRIED TO SHOW A COMMON PICTURE ON BOTH DEVICES SIDE BY SIDE, STILL THEY COULDN'T MAKE OUT ANY DIFFERENCE! POOR SOULS GOT CONNED BY THE MOBILE SELLERS, CUZ THEY JUST WANTED A SIMPLE PHABLET, YET ENDED UP BUYING S4, NOTE3 ETC!
      
      
      ONE WILL BE FOOLISH TO COMPARE THIS TO GALAXY GRAND, CUZ XPERIA C IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT. I MEAN GALAXY GRAND HAS GOT PATHETIC SCREEN RESOLUTION, IF U SEE A CIRCULAR IMAGE ON ITS SCREEN, THE BOUNDARY LOOKS SKEWED AND UNEVEN! ALSO ITS PROCESSOR AND RAM ARE BELOW AVERAGE IN PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      NOTE: EVEN TODAY I AM A SAMSUNG FAN, AND MY OPINION IS THAT SAMSUNG PROVIDES BEST VALUE-FOR-MONEY. I ALSO THINK THAT SONY XPERIA RANGE IS SLIGHTLY OVERPRICED, AND THEY CHARGE HIGH PREMIUM FOR THEIR SLIGHTLY BETTER HARDWARE AND BRAND NAME. BUT, NOWADAYS SAMSUNG HAS NOT REMAINED EXCLUSIVE AND PREMIUM ANYMORE, AND I WANTED TO TRY OUT SONY XPERIA RANGE SINCE A LONG TIME. BUT, I WILL NEVER BUY ANY SONY MOBILE PHONE UNLESS I GET IT AT A DISCOUNT, I.E. UNLESS THE PRICE SEEMS FAIR TO ME!"
Xperia C,4,"I BOUGHT SONY XPERIA C ON 10.01.2014. THE PRODUCT GOT DELIVERED ON 13.01.2014.SINCE THEN I AM USING IT IN PLACE OF MY EXISTING SAMSUNG YPRO-DUOS.
      
      
      I FOUND IT EXTREMELY GOOD BE IT ABOUT IT PROCESSOR, INTERNET SPEED, INTERNAL MEMORY. BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO EXCELLENT.
      
      
      LISTENING WALKMEN VIA SONY HEADPHONE (WHICH WAS PROVIDED FREE OF COST WITH THE CELL) IS JUST AWESOME.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL- BUYING SONY XPERIA C(WHITE) ALONG WITH SONY HEADPHONE @ RS.17338/- IS AN AMAZING BUY AND WILL RECOMMEND FUTURE BUYERS MUST GIVES A LOOK TO THIS MOBILE IF ONE IS  LOOKING FOR A BRANDED  DUAL SIM MOBILE,HAVING LATEST CONFIGURATION AND GOOD BATTERY LIFE UNDER RS.20000/-.

Xperia C,4,"I BOUGHT THIS DEVICE FROM MY LOCAL SONY STORE. I DIDN'T GET IT FROM FLIPKART JUST BECAUSE I CANNOT WAIT FOR THAT DELIVERY TIME, GOD THAT DELIVERY TIME! EVEN THOUGH FLIPKART OFFERED IT FOR 1200RS LESS BUT REALLY THAT ISN'T A BIG DEAL. NOW, COMING TO THE REVIEW. LET ME TELL YOU VERY CLEARLY THAT THIS PHONE IS BETTER THAN HTC ONE X WHICH COSTS 24,000RS!. LOOKS: THE DEVICE LOOKS LIKE XPERIA Z EXCEPT FOR THE SCREEN WHICH IS NOT CLEARBLACK, IVE USED LUMIA 820 CLEAR BLACK AND IT LOOKS PRETTY COOL!, BUT NOT TO MENTION THE DISPLAY, CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS(NOT TOO BRIGHT THOUGH :(  NOTE: ITS HARD TO SEE THE SCREEN IN THE SUN OR IN  A VERY BRIGHT LIT PLACE, UNLIKE CLEARBLACK, BUT REALLY DISPLAY DOESNT MATTER MUCH THE PERFORMANCE MATTERS!, ALSO THE SCREEN QUALITY IS GOOD. NOW COMING TO THE PERFORMANCE: YOU GET TO USE 974MB RAM OUT OF 1GB OFFERED, WELL... FRANKLY 1GB RAM IS VERY LESS FOR A QUAD CORE PROCESSOR. IT HAS THE 544MP GPU WHICH IS GOOD, PLAYS ALL GAMES SMOOTHLY EVEN GTA SAN ANDREAS!. I ALSO NOTICED SOME LAG IN THE DEVICE, MAYBE IT IS DUE TO THE OPERATING SYSTEM, NOT TO MENTION ANDROID IS THE ONLY MOBILE OS WHICH HAS REAL MULTITASKING AND CAN STILL RUN APPS IN BACKGROUND(FULLY FUNCTIONAL) WHILE YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING ELSE. NOW COMING TO THE CAMERA, I HATE THE FRONT CAMERA! FOR REAL VERY BAD QUALITY!. FOR THE 8MP CAMERA BACK ITS DAMN GOOD! RECORDS FULL HD VIDEOS EXCELLENT!. LET US SUMMARISE THE REVIEW HERE. AND OH WAIT A SECOND! I FELT THE SCREEN TOUCH IS NOT TOO SENSITIVE, AFTER APPLYING THE SCREEN GUARD FEATHER TOUCH IINPUT IS IMPOSSIBRU!
      
      
      PROS: EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE, LARGE SCREEN, LOOKS LIKE XPERIA Z XD, GOOD SCREEN RESOLUTION, EXCELLENT LOOKS
      
      
      CONS: NOT CLEARBLACK DISPLAY, TOUCH INPUT SLIGHTLY SLOW AS COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILE OS LIKE IOS AND WINDOWS PHONE BUT REALLY IT IS JUST THE PROBLEM OF THE OS!, OH MAN! RIDICULOUS HEADSET FOR REAL! ,
      
      
      CONCLUSION: THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST PHONE IN THE RANGE OF 10-20K YES ! BUT U CAN OPT FOR XPERIA SP JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE 20K BUT YEA SP DOESNT FALL UNDER 20K FOR REAL! WHY I DIDNT BUY SP? WELL.... MY CHOICE AFTER ALL, C HAS BIG SCREEN ANYHOW. CHEERS!"
Xperia C,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 20 DAYS BACK.. I WILL PRECISELY WRITE DOWN THE PROS &AMP; CONS
      
      
      PROS :
      
      PREMIUM LOOKS, SLEEK DESIGN, GOOD BODY BUILD..
      
      RAM 1GB IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MULTI TASKING..
      
      GOOD PLAYBACK OF HD VIDEOS..
      
      CALL QUALITY IS GOOD..
      
      NO ISSUES OF INTERNAL MEMORY WITH ME.. APPS TRANSFERABLE TO SD CARD..
      
      GOOD BATTERY BACKUP 1.5 DAYS USAGE WITH DUAL SIM, 3G AND NORMAL GAMES..
      
      DUAL MICRO SIM ALSO WORKS FINE.. SIM1 SLOT IS 3G ENABLED.. GOOD INTERNET BROWSING, VIDEO CALLS ETC..
      
      NO HEATING OR HANGING PROBLEM.. AT LEAST IN MY SET..
      
      
      CONS :
      
      CAMERA WAS DISSAPPOINTING FOR ME.. REAR 8MP CAM IS FINE FOR DAYLIGHT PHOTOS BUT WITH LOW LIGHT ITS RESULT WAS VERY POOR.. FRONT CAMERA IS WORTHLESS FOR SELFIES BUT FINE FOR VIDEO CALLS..
      
      VIDEO QUALITY ALSO DOESNT LOOK LIKE 1080P.. AND MIC IS SENSITIVE IN RECORDING VOICE FROM DISTANCE.. WITH SOME CAM SETTINGS U CAN IMPROVE PICTURE QUALITY A BIT..
      
      SCREEN RESOLUTION IS QHD.. ALTHOUGH ITS FINE BUT SHUD HV BEEN AT LEAST 1280X720P ON A 5 INCH SCREEN SIZE..
      
      BATTERY DRAINS QUICKLY AFTER IT REACHES 30% SO ALL U HV GOT IS 70-75% OF BATTERY BACKUP..
      
      A LITTLE BIT OVERPRICED.. SHUD HV BEEN AROUND 16000
      
      
      BOTTOMLINE :
      
      
      PHONE IS GOOD FOR DAILY USAGE, CALLING, GAMES N INTERNET..
      
      NOT GOOD FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS..
      
      IF BUYING.. GO FOR THE PURPLE VARIANT.. ITS EYE CATCHING.. I OWN IT.."
Xperia C,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE TODAY AND AS FAR AS THE PERFORMANCE IS CONCERNED, I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THE BLAZING FAST SPEED OF THIS PHONE. THE MAIN ADVANTAGE IS YOU WOULD GET NO PHONES WITH 5 INCH SCREEN SIZE WITHIN THIS PRICE !
      
      GO FOR IT !"
Xperia C,4,"I BOUGHT XPERIA C A MONTH AGO AND SO FAR SO GOOD. THIS IS MY 1ST ANDROID PHONE, SO BARE WITH YOU SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING FOR ANYONE.
      
      GOOD
      
      SLEEK PHONE AND THE SCREEN IS LARGE TO WATCH MOVIES
      
      CLARITY IS TOO GOOD ESPECIALLY WATCHING MOVIES IS VERY GOOD
      
      NAVIGATION IS EASY
      
      CAMERA CLARITY IS GOOD
      
      
      BAD / NOT FAMILIAR
      
      OPENING THE BACK COVER FOR INSERTING SIM AND SD CARD IS MESSY
      
      COULD NOT FIND HOW TO SHOOT CONTINUOUS SHOTS
      
      FEEL MEMORY ALLOCATION OF 1 GB FOR APPS AND 1.2 GB FOR INTERNAL STORAGE IS NOT GOOD"
Xperia C,4,"I BROUGHT IT OUT SIDE FLIPKART. FM RADIO IS NOT WORKING, IT HAS DEFAULT OPTION AND SEARCH FOR CHANNELS BUT I AM UNABLE TO GET FM STATION IN BANGALORE. IT IS SHOWING ONLY MONO SOUND."
Xperia C,4,"I BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART AT VERY REASONABLE RATE. IT HAS LATEST VERSION OF ANDROID. THE DISPLAY, SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD. THE FUNCTION ARE VERY USER FREINDLY. BUT IF SONY IMPROVE SOME OF ITS PHONE DESIGN COULD LOOK VERY ATTRACTIVE."
Xperia C,4,I FOUND THE MOBILE GIVING GOOD PERFORMANCE IN ALL RESPECTS ESPECIALLY BATTERY BACK UP EXCEPT ITS NETWORK COVERAGE THERE SEEMS TO BE POOR ANTENNA IN IT HOPE SONY WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. FULL MARKS TO FLIPKART FOR THEIR SERVICE OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN FULL 5 STARS.
Xperia C,4,"I GOT THE PHONE ALONG WITH THE BIG HEADSET FOR 17870. THE SONY HEADSET WAS A SUPRISE.. I HADN'T NOTICED IT WHILE BUYING.. HOWEVER IT DID OFFSET THE DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN I REALIZED THAT THE STOCK HEADPHONES ARE NOT IN-EAR. THE BIG HEADPHONES THAT I GOT WERE THE OVER THE EAR SONY ONES.
      
      
      SONY IS UNBEATABLE WHEN IT CONCERNS SOUND! THAT'S ITS USP I WOULD SAY AND THIS MODEL KEPT UP TO THE TREND I'VE LONGED OBSERVED.
      
      
      THE CAMERAS HOWEVER, DON'T DO WELL. IT'S NOT SUPRISING THAT THE SELFIES ON THE FRONT CAMERA ARE BAD (LOTS OF NOISE), NOR THE FACT THAT THE 8MP IS OVER ALL 'DECENT' BUT TAKES LOUSY NIGHT, SHOT.. BECAUSE SONY ISN'T REALLY GOOD AT MAKING CAMERAS.. CYBERSHOT WAS AN ERA LONG GONE.. THE CAMERAS THEY MAKE RIGHT NOW SUCK.. I HAVE A SONY CAMERA DSC W210 16 MP AND ALL THAT. VERY NOISY!! AND TAKES SAD PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE NIGHT.
      
      
      COMING BACK TO THE PHONE, THE CAMERA IS OK-OK.. IT'S NOT IPHONE QUALITY. IT'LL GET YOU BY BUT DON'T BE EXPECTING TOO MUCH.
      
      
      REGARDING THE FEEL OF THE PHONE, IT'S LIGHT, EASY TO CARRY ON LONG CALLS.
      
      
      INTERFACE IS PLEASANT, STILL GETTING USED TO IT.
      
      
      CALLS ARE CLEAR, HOWEVER AS USUAL THE SPEAKER ISN'T THAT LOUD. I ALSO HAVE DIFFICULTY COMMUNICATING USING THE MIKE OF THE STOCK HEADSET.
      
      
      SCREEN QUALITY IS DECENT, HOWEVER COULD BE BETTER.
      
      
      HAVING SAID A LOT, I WOULD SAY IF THIS IS A PHONE YOU WANT TO GIVE YOUR PARENTS OR AGED FOLKS WHO WANT A BRANDED PHONE WITH A GOOD SCREENS SIZE FOR WHATSAPP AND WATCHING MOVIES/MUSIC.. IT'S WORTH IT!! GO FOR IT.
      
      
      DON'T BUY ONE FOR YOURSELF THOUGH IF YOU AGREE WITH THE NEGATIVES."
Xperia C,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS DEVICE FOR MORE THAN 3 WEEKS. ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT IS THE IMAGE QUALITY, EVERYTHING ELSE LOOK VERY COOL. I AM NOT EXPERIENCING ANY LAG, NOT EVEN WHILE PLAYING ASPHALT 8 OR MODERN COMBAT 4. I'VE INSTALLED THIS TWO GAMES. SOUND QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD."
Xperia C,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART ON FEB2014. PHONE IS OK, GOOD BATTERY BACKUP,DISPLAY,SOUND BUT THE CAMERA IS NOT VERY MUCH IMPRESSIVE. AND FROM 4 GB INTERNAL AT FIRST I CAN USE ONLY 1.2 AS USER.
      
      THE 5 INCH DISPLAY IS VERY FRIENDLY FOR EBOOKS READING AND MOVIE PLAYING.
      
      IF YOUR BUDGET IS WITHIN 20K THEN IT IS A SMART BUY ONE"
Xperia C,4,"I LIKED IT VERY MUCH..
      
      AND IT IS QUITE FAST AND CAN RUN SOME HEAVY GRAPHIC INTENSIVE GAMES.."
Xperia C,4,"I M USING THIS CELL FOR ALMOST A MONTH NOW AND IT IS WORKING JUST FINE..GOOD THING BOUT THIS MOB. IS BATTERY BACKUP, PERFORMANCE AND GAMING EXPERIENCE IS ALSO NOT BAD....AND THE CONS ARE FRONT CAM. PRIMARY CAM. IS NOT THAT GOOD AS COMPARE TO XPERIA P ,S. AND THE THING WHICH BUG ME THE MOST IS IT'S CHARGING TIME .IT TAKE 3 TO 4 HOUR TO GET FULLY CHARGED.IT SOUND QUALITY SUCKS........BUT OVERALL IT IS A GOOD PACKAGE AT THIS RANGE.....SO MY ADVICE GO FOR IT ............"
Xperia C,4,"I ORDERED AN XPERIA C FROM FLIPKART, AND I GOT DELIVERY WITHIN 3 DAYS, EVERYTHING IS GOOD BUT I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR TOUCH RESPONSE ,BUT ITS SATISFACTORY ..XPERIA M TOUCH IS BETTER THAN XPERIA C,AND ABOUT THE DISPLAY ITS SUPERB (Y)AND BATTERY LASTS REALLY LONG BUT ITS INTEGRATED IN PHONE XD, WE CAN INSTALL APPS DIRECTLY TO SD CARD AND IT HAS 8MP CAMERA WITH 1080P RECORDING..WHEN I USED IT FIRST THE IMAGES ARE SOMEWHAT BLURRY.(WHEN I ZOOMED IN).AND I DIDNT FIND ANY MORE DRAWBACKS THAN THIS .AND DONT TAKE WHITE CUZ ITS GONNA GET BROWNISH SOON!!.TIRED OF CHANGING CASES FOR IT LOL :P"
Xperia C,4,"I REALLY LIKE THIS SMARTPHONE....ITS LOOK IS VERY DEADLY....5"" DISPLAY...!!LOOKS SUPERB
      
      SIMPLY ITS BETTER AT THIS RANGE..
      
      BUT BATTERY GIVES 24 HR XACTLY BY USING EVERTHING.!"
Xperia C,4,"I USUALLY DONT DO THIS BUT THIS DEVICE DESERVES A HONOURABLE MENTION AND A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A MID RANGE DEVICE, AND AT UNDER 20K THIS IS A NO BRAINER..
      
      
      I AM A HTC ONE USER AND I KNOW HOW THE BEST PERFORMS SO KEEPING THE HTC ONE AS THE BENCHMARK THIS PHONE IS NOT A VERY BAD DEAL IF U ARE A FIRST TIME ANDROID USER OR SOMEONE LOOKING FOR A BIGGER SCREEN EXPERIENCE.. I GOT HIS FOR MY MOM AND SHE HAS BEEN LOVING IT SO FAR ITS ERGONOMIC AND AND BUILD QUALITY IS GREAT, THE SCREEN IS A DECENT ONE BUT THE SPEED OF THIS DEVICE IS BLAZING FAST..
      
      
      ALL IN ALL A GREAT DEVICE TO LOOK AT IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET FOR A MID RANGE ANDROID DEVICE."
Xperia C,4,"I WAS APPREHENSIVE PURCHASING A PHONE ONLINE. HOWEVER, FLIPKART HAS PROVED MY TRUST AGAIN. THE PHONE IS ACTUALLY WHAT IT IS STATED TO BE. PACKING WAS GREAT AND I GOT FREE SONY HEADPHONES WHICH WAS NOT LISTED WHEN I MADE THE PURCHASE. THE PHONE IS AWESOME IN THIS PRICE RANGE.. HAS ALMOST ALL THE FEATURES AS REQUIRED FOR YOUR NORMAL USAGE.. JUST ONE PROBLEM.. THE SCREEN IS TFT AND AFFECTS UR EYES.. OTHERWISE ITS A VALUE FOR MONEY!"
Xperia C,4,"IF YOUR REQUIREMENTS ARE :-
      
      
      BUDGET - UNDER 20K.
      
      DUAL SIM PHONE.
      
      BIG SCREEN.
      
      LONG LASTING BATTERY.(1.5 ON WIFI, 2+ DAYS WITHOUT WIFI)
      
      HIGH QUALITY SPEAKERS FOR MUSIC.
      
      
      THEN THIS IS THE BEST PHONE FOR YOU.
      
      
      ALSO, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE IF PIXEL DENSITY MATTERS TO YOU. PIXEL DENSITY IS LOW BECAUSE OF ITS LARGE DISPLAY."
Xperia C,4,"I'M A FAN OF FLIPKART SERVICES NOW AFTER ORDERING COUPLE OF PRODUCTS FROM THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
      
      AS FAR AS THIS PHONE IS CONCERNED, I AM OVERALL SATISFIED. DONE SOME RESEARCH BEFORE BYING, COMPARED DIFFERENT BRANDS ON FLIPKART. USED MICROMAX CANVAS HD AND SAMSUNG GRAND IN PAST FEW MONTHS BUT WAS NOT UPTO MARK. XPERIA C COMPARED TO THESE IS BETTER ONE.
      
      ONLY CON IS ITS INTERNAL STORAGE CAPACITY
      
      OVERALL, I RECOMMEND THIS"
Xperia C,4,"IT IS A BRILLIANT PHONE IN THIS RANGE..EXCELLENT PACKAGE AND FAST DELIVERY BY FLIPKART.THE DISPLAY IS AWESOME ALONG WITH THE SOUND QUALITY.
      
      THE ONLY PROBLEM I FACED WAS OPENING THE BACK COVER
      
      OVERALL ITS A GREAT DEVICE."
Xperia C,4,"IT WAS GREAT IN TERMS OF DELIVERY. PRODUCT WAS IN GOOD SHAPE.
      
      AS A MOBILE, XPERIA C IS A NICE ONE WITH VERY SLIM DESIGN WHICH IS AN ASPECT WHERE IT IS AHEAD I THINK OF OTHER COMPETITORS. CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD SPECIALLY VIDEO QUALITY.
      
      ONLY DRAWBACK IS INTERNAL STORAGE. ALTHOUGH IT ALLOWS TO MOVE APPLICATION FROM INTERNAL SD STORAGE TO EXTERNAL SD STORAGE, STILL THERE ARE MANY APPLICATIONS WHICH DON'T ALLOW IT. HIGHER INTERNAL STORAGE FOR THOSE APPLICATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN A KILLER."
Xperia C,4,"ITS A GREAT PHONE FOR THE ONES WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION TO OLD LOOKING SAMSUNG PHONES AND ALSO SOME OF THE PHONES AVAILABLE IN THE PRICE RANGE. GREAT PICTURE QUALITY AND MOST IMP GREAT BATTERY BACK UP. U MAYBE DIS POINTED WITH DISPLAY RESOLUTION AND CAMERA IMAGES SINCE U HAVE HIGH EXPECTATION FROM SONY.
      
      OVERALL A GOOD PHONE TO BUY AND AS ALWAYS THANKS FLIPKART FOR GREAT DEAL AND FAST SHIPPING!!!!!!!!!"
Xperia C,4,"IT'S A VERY NICE AND BEAUTIFUL PHONE. IT'S VERY EASY TO HANDLE AND GOOD. BUT YOU MAY OPT FOR A MOBILE WITH MORE INTERNAL MEMORY, BUT AT THE PRICE RANGE, IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS."
Xperia C,4,"LOOKED AT ALL THE DUAL SIM PHONES IN THE MARKET AND ZEROED IN ON THIS ONE.
      
      HAS A GOOD LOW POWER PROCESSOR, SONY BRAND NAME, GOOD AUDIO QUALITY AND VALUE OF MONEY
      
      DISPLAY PPI IS NOT ADEQUATE FOR A 5INCH PHONE, BUT WHAT ELSE CAN YOU GET AT THIS PRICE POINT
      
      SONY HEADPHONES FREE WITH THIS PHONE- GOOD QUALITY
      
      
      REGARDING FLIPKART - IN A DAY GAURANTEE - DIDNT WORK. I HAD TO CALL FLIPKART SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PROMISE THE DELIVERY TIME. UNHAPPY WITH FLIPKART FOR MAKING SUCH PROMISE AND UNABLE TO DELIVER.
      
      HOWEVER, THEY REFUNDED THE ""IN A DAY"" GAURANTEE EXTRA CHARGES + COMPENSATION OF 180
      
      RECEIVED TEH PRODUCT WITHIN 4 DAYS OF ORDER"
Xperia C,4,NC PERFORMNC I LIKE IT.. SONY  EXPERIA C CAMERA IS SUPRB CLARITY... AND ITS PRCSSER IS VERY  GOOD.. TOTALY ITS WORTH
Xperia C,4,"NICE PHONE, BATTERY BACK UP IS AWESOME. PICTURE AND AUDIO QUALTY IS AMAZINGYOU CAN CHOOZE THE MOBILE ON EVERY SAMSUNG MOBILE."
Xperia C,4,"NICE PHONE..  SWIFT AND FAST NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH PERFORMANCE.. PICS ARE GOOD ENOUGH..  SLEEK AND STYLIST..ONLY PROBLEM IS WITH INTERNAL MEMORY.. THE AVAILABLE INTERNAL MEMORY OF 1.2GB IS JUST NOT ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH I AM USING A 16GB MEMORY CARD... HAVE FACED ""INTERNAL STORAGE FULL ""MANY TIMES"
Xperia C,4,"NICE PRODUCT AND THAT TOO GOT IT CHEAP ONLY AT FLIPKART...BATTERY IS A BIG CONCERN BUT COMMON IN SUCH SMART PHONES, ALL GOOD SMOOTH NAVIGATION."
Xperia C,4,NICE TIMELY DELIVERY AS USUAL...VERY NICE PHONE.GOOD LOOKS AND FEATURES AS ADVERTISED. I AM VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH BUYING THIS PHONE.
Xperia C,4,"OVER ALL GOOD PHONE. COMPARE TO SAMSUNG GRAND XPERIA C IS MUCH BETTER AND LOOKS DIFFERENT. IM FACING A PROBLEM OF SCREEN VISIBILITY AT THE TIME OF CALLING IT MAY BE SOME SENSOR ISSUE, IF ANY ONE CAN HELP ME THEN SUGGESTIONS ARE MOST WELCOME !!!"
Xperia C,4,PERFORMANCE IS GOOD. MUSIC QUALITY IS TOO GOOD. LOOK IS ATTRACTIVE. VERY SLIM AND COMPACT DESIGN......
Xperia C,4,"PRODUCT IS GOOD.. BUT WITH IN LESS THAN 10 DAYS IT GOT STUCK TWICE.. NOW I DOUBT IF I HAVE GOT THE PROPER PRODUCT OR NOT.
      
      
      WORST PART IS THAT THESE MOBILES ARE COMING WITH INBUILT BATTERY AND IS PHONE IS STUCK WE NEED TO RESET IT. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY GIVE A REMOVAL BATTERY WHICH IS VERY EASY AND EFFECTIVE RATHER THAN THIS DRAMA.
      
      
      SCREEN QUALITY, SPEED ARE GOOD. COMING TO CAM , I AM NOT FEELING AS IF I AM USING SONY CAM....MY LAST PHONE EXPERIA X10 I WAS AS GOOD AS 14MP DIGITAL CAM....I DONT SEE THAT CLARITY IN THIS ONE...
      
      
      ALL IN ALL ...IF YOU ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT SIZE... PLS BETTER GO FOR XPERIA M WHICH IS LITTLE SMALL AND EASY TO HANDLE"
Xperia C,4,"PROS:
      
      LARGE DISPLAY - SHARP AND CRISP DISPLAY.
      
      SOUND CLARITY IS AWESOME WITH THE DEFAULT HEADSET.
      
      PERFORMANCE IS GOOD - NO DELAY IN RESPONSE.
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      LOW SYSTEM MEMORY - 1 GB FOR APPS THAT'S VERY LOW FOR A QUAD CORE PROCESSOR MOBILE. (MAJOR CONCERN)
      
      FRONT CAMERA COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
      
      NON REMOVABLE BATTERY.
      
      
      CONCLUSION: GOOD 5 INCH SIZE PHONE WITH FEW MINUSES. COME ON, THERE WILL BE ALWAYS NEGATIVES FOR ANY MOBILE.. NOTHING IS PERFECT..
      
      
      UPDATE
      
      
      I HOPED THAT SONY WOULD FIX THE ISSUES SUCH AS THE QUALITY OF THE CAMERA, SEVERE BATTERY DRAIN BELOW 30%, LOW VOLUME VIA THE HEADPHONE JACK, APPS DISAPPEARING FROM THE HOME SCREEN ON REBOOT AND INTERNAL MEMORY RESTRICTIONS.
      
      BUT ONLY THE APPS DISAPPEARING FROM THE HOME SCREEN ON REBOOT ISSUE IS RESOLVED WITH THE FIRMWARE UPDATE 16.0.B.2.6."
Xperia C,4,"SONY EXPERIA C IS GOOD IN ALL ASPECTS EXCEPT POOR SOUND QUALITY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SPEAKERS. FM RADIO RECEPTION IS ALSO NOT GOOD. PRICING IS A BIT HIGH WHEN COMPARE WITH LG PRO LITE, WHICH HAS 8 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND MORE ATTRACTIVE FEATURES. BUT LG PRO LITE'S 8 MP CAMERA IS NOT GOOD. EXPERIA C ALSO HAS 8MP FRONT CAMERA IN WHICH PICTURE QUALITY IS EXTREMELY GOOD.."
Xperia C,4,"SONY HAS MADE A VERY NICE PHONE.. WELL FUNCTIONING PHONE, AS I EXPECTED. VERY HAPPY TO USE. BUT SOMETIME BATTERY SAVER MODE IS NOT HELPING IN ESTIMATION TIME. AND SOMETIME BRIGHTNESS SENSOR IS NOT WORKING. YOU HAVE TO RESET FACTORY TO GET REAL ESTIMATION TIME, IF U WANT TO. AND YOU HAVE TO LOCK SCREEN AGAIN TO GET BRIGHTNESS SENSOR RIGHT."
Xperia C,4,"THE BEST DUAL SIM PHONE ONE COULD BUY IN 18.5K.
      
      
      - HATS OFF TO THE BATTERY BACKUP.
      
      - PHONE DOES NOT LAGS AT ALL.
      
      - A LITTLE COMPROMISE HAS TO BE DONE WITH CAMERA(BUT ITS FAIR ENOUGH)"
Xperia C,4,"THE FIRST PRODUCT I RECEIVED WAS DEFECTIVE AND IT'S RECEPTORS WERE NOT WORKING HENCE NO SIGNAL, BUT KUDOS TO FLIPKART WHO REPLACED WITHIN 48 HOURS AND WOULD HAVE WITHIN 24 HOURS BUT COULD NOT COURTESY THE SUNDAY. THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WHEN I COMPLAINED TO THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT THEY TRIED TO TAKE ME THROUGH A LONG PROCESS WITH STRANGE TECHNICALITIES OF THE PHONE WHICH DID NOT WORK.
      
      COMING TO THE PHONE ;
      
      IT'S A DECENT MID RANGE PHONE FROM SONY NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT, FOR THE MOST PART I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY LAGS, IGNORE THE OCCASIONAL FORCE CLOSE. GAT VICE CITY WORKS FLAWLESSLY AND ASHPHALT 8 NEEDS TO BE ENJOYED ON THE LOW SETTING HOWEVER EVEN ON MEDIUM IT IS PLAYABLE BUT NOT ON HIGH AS THERE IS A SEVERE DROP IN FRAME RATES.
      
      THE CAMERA IS AVERAGE MORE LIKE THE IPHONE 4, 5 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA BUT TAKES OKAY SHOTS AND I HAVE LOADED SOME 1080 P VIDEOS WHICH WORK FLAWLESSLY.
      
      THE BATTERY LIFE IS INSANELY LONG AND I HAVE NEVER REALLY EXPERIENCED ANY HEATING ISSUES.
      
      THE THEMES ARE CLASSY AND I LOVE THE LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT BELOW THE PANEL. THE BUILD QUALITY IS QUITE STURDY AND I'M NOT EVEN USING A COVER OR A CASE. OVERALL A GOOD BUY IN THE UNDER 20K RANGE, BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHEN U SPEND 18K, AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT LATER YOU FEEL YOU COULD HAVE PAID THE EXTRA 5K AND PICKED UP THE  BLACKBERRY Z 10 FOR 23K AT THE TIME. AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. GOOD DAY"
Xperia C,4,"THE MOBILE IS FRIENDLY AND EASY TO USE. CAMERA IS QUITE GOOD AT THIS PRICE. THE MOBILE DIDNT HANGED UP IN ANY STAGE. TOUCH IS ALSO QUITE GOOD.
      
      AT TIMES I THOUGH FEEL THAT THE INTERNET IS A BIT SLOW.
      
      APPLICATIONS ARE GOOD.
      
      OVERALL AM SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT."
Xperia C,4,"THE OVERALL PACKAGE IS GOOD, BEING LATEST ANDROID. BUT THE DOWNSIDE IS CAMERA.
      
      SERIOUSLY THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESS BY SONY(ALMOST ALL MODELS UNTIL EXPERIA Z SERIES). ITS NOT ONLY BELOW EXPECTATION, BUT THE THE QUALITY IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. THATS IT.YOU'RE ON THE WAY IF YOU COULD COMPENSATE THIS FROM GOOD RECORDING QUALITY IT HAS."
Xperia C,4,"THE PHONE IS GOOD AND HAS A GOOD BATTERY LIFE.
      
      THE FEATURES I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS IS THE DUAL SIM SWITCH AND
      
      THE VOLUME IS LITTLE LOW.THE FRONT CAM CAN BE 1.3 MP
      
      FLIPKART IS PROMT IN DELEVING THE PRODUCT ON TIME."
Xperia C,4,"THIS IS A GREAT PHONE BETTER THAN GALAXY GRAND IF YOU HAD A RANGE OF  RS 20,000 YOU SHOULD GO FOR THIS PHONE.
      
      
      PROS&GT;1.2 GHZ QUAD CORE PROCESSOR WHICH IS BETTER THEN DUAL CORE.
      
      
      HD DISPLAY WHICH IS VERY SHARP AND VERY CLEAR
      
      
      SPEAKERS ARE GOOD

      EXPANDABLE MEMORY IS ALSO GOOD 32 GB
      
      
      CONS &GT; FRONT CAMERA IS VGA WHICH IS REALLY BAD
      
      INTERNAL MEMORY IS ONLY 4GB AND ANDROID DOES NOT SUPPORT                                  EXPANDBLE MEMORY.
      
      
      DONT  HAVE AN QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON 800 PROCESSOR

Xperia C,4,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I PURCHASED A MOBILE ONLINE, THE MOBILE SET I GOT WAS HAVING THE SEAL BROKEN OR IT'S BEEN PASTED WITH GLUE, IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THE SEAL TABS WERE RE PASTED ON THAT MOBILE SET. ANYWAYS THE PRODUCT IS WORKING UP TIL NOW."
Xperia C,4,THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY GOOD ND OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS ALSO GOOD. BUT SOME PROBLEM I FACED DURING PRODUCT ORDER IS THAT FLIPKART NOT DOING DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS TO SOME MAJOR CITIES.
Xperia C,4,"ULTIMATE PHONE UNDER 20K RANGE. A MUST BUY PHONE AND SERVICES OF FLIPKART ARE SUPER.
      
      THIS PHONE STOPPED WORKING AFTER 6 DAYS OF PURCHASING BUT AFTER LOGGING COMPLAINT I GOT REPLACEMENT WITHIN 2 DAYS. DISPLAY AND SOUND QUALITY OF THIS DEVICE IS GREAT."
Xperia C,4,UNBELIEVABLE...ORDERED ON 19TH FEB (NIGHT) AND RECEIVED ON 24TH FEB. USUALLY ALL THE ON-LINE ORDERS TOOK MORE THAN 2 WEEKS TO DELIVER HERE. WHAT A SERVICE.... :) ALSO RECEIVED A SONY HEADPHONE AS FREE GIFT EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT SHOWING IN THE AD. THANKS A LOT.
Xperia C,4,"WELL I WAS THNKING 2 BUY A NEW MOBILE AND GOT INTERESTED IN BUYING DIS PRODUCT.
      
      FLIPKART GAVE ME THE BEST PRICE AND ALSO DELIVERED IT TO ME IN 2 DAYS..
      
      A BANG ON PRICE...
      
      ALSO THE PHONE ROCKS
      
      GOOD LOOKS
      
      GOOD CAMERA

      ONLY THAT INTERNAL STORAGE IS LEFT WITH ONLY 1GB."
Xperia C,4,"WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  MTK6589 QUAD CORE PROCESSOR OR QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON S4 PRO PROCESSOR.
      
      I WANT TO BUY A MOBILE PLEASE SUGGEST ME B/W XPERIA C AND XPERIA SP"
Xperia C,4,XPERIA C IS GOOD MAINLY PACKING AND DELIVERY FROM FLIPKART ARE HUMBLE AND GOOD. I'M LOVING USING IT NICE MIDRANGE PHONE FROM SONY.
Xperia C,4,"XPERIA C IS GOOD SMARTH FOR ANDROID USER.
      
      THE VOICE AND DISPLAY QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      I M NOT SATISFIED CAMERA.
      
      NIGHT VISION IS NOT GOOD.
      
      SOUND IS GOOD BUT NOT GET HIGH LEVEL OF MUSIC."
Xperia C,4,"XTEMELY GOOD FOR TEENAGERS..
      
      
      SLEEK DESIGN
      
      
      LATEST ANDRIOD
      
      
      NO MALFUNCTIONING
      
      
      BETTER THAN SAMSUNG GRAND
      
      
      NICE VIDEO AND IMAGE QUALITY
      
      
      GO FOR IT"
Xperia C,3,"ALL GOOD ABOUT THE PRODUCT, ONLY THAT THE INBUILT MEMORY IS 4 GB AND I GET 2 GB FOR DOWNLOAD
      
      
      ON FLIPKART SERVICE:BY WHEN DO I GET MY CASH BACK OF 10% FOR HDFC PURCHASE"
Xperia C,3,AS PER THE SPECS. THE PRICE SHOULD BE NEAR 15 - 16 K. THEN ONLY SONY CAN GET A GRIP OF THE MARKET. XPERIA SP IS WORTH ITS PRICE OF 20 K BECAUSE OF ITS SPECS.
Xperia C,3,AWESOME HANDSET... BUT MOLIFE FLIP COVER FOR SONY XPERIA C IS NOT WORTHY FOR ITS PRICE. WONT HOLD THE MOBILE FOR LONG TIME AS IT IS HAVING STICKER INSIDE TO HOLD THE MOBILE AND NOT THE CLAMP.
Xperia C,3,BATTERY PROBLEM AFTER 35% DRAINS VERY FAST. TILL NOW WORKING GOOD. ANY PROBLEM WILL UPDATE THE REVIEW. GOOD PHONE AT THIS PRICE.
Xperia C,3,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE REVIEWS.
      
      
      OVERALL A GOOD PHONE IN TERMS OF DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE BUT THE BIG LET DOWN IS THE BATTERY.
      
      
      BATTERY IS NOT LASTING EVEN FOR HALF DAY DESPITE NOT USING THIS PHONE FOR 2G OR 3G."
Xperia C,3,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON DIWALI. BEFORE ORDERING, I WAS QUITE CONFUSED DUE TO SUCH REGULAR PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ESPECIALLY ON THIS PHONE. I'VE SEEN THE SAME PHONE PRICED AT 17200 AND THEN AT 18800 AND THEN AT 19005, 20490 AND MORE, ALL THIS WITHIN THE SPACE OF ONLY A FEW HOURS. THIS ALWAYS GOT MY THINKING WHETHER I SHOULD WAIT OR PLACE THE ORDER RIGHTAWAY. THE MOMENT ARRIVED WHEN I THOUGHT IT'S NOT WISE TO WAIT FURTHER AND BOUGHT IT FOR 20490 WITH AN EXCHANGE OFFER. BUT STILL LEAVES A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE 17200 TAG + 15% CASHBACK WHICH I COULDN'T GO FOR AT THAT MOMENT. SO THE LESSON IS, IT'S NOT ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO WAIT N WATCH.
      
      
      ANYWAY, FLIPKART DID A GOOD JOB IN DELIVERING THIS. IT REACHED ME WELL BEFORE THEIR EXPECTED TIME.
      
      
      COMING TO THE PHONE NOW. LET'S LOOK AT THE GOOD THINGS:
      
      
      1. LOOKS AND FIRST FEEL: XPERIA C IS A STYLISH PHONE WHOSE SCREEN SIZE IS BOUND TO MAKE YOU LIKE IT INSTANTLY. THE FIRST FEEL OF THE INTERFACE IS QUITE SMOOTH EVENTHOUGH ITS NOT ABSOLUTELY BUTTERY.
      
      
      2. DOES PRETTY WELL ON INTERNET SURFING IF YOU HAVE A GOOD CONNECTION AND BOOTS UP QUICKLY.
      
      
      3. PERFORMANCE - THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF HUE AND CRY ABOUT THIS HAVING A MEDIATEK PROCESSOR AND HONESTLY I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THAT BEFORE BUYING IT. WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED AFTER USING IT IS, THAT IT'S SURPRISINGLY GOOD IN PERFORMANCE SO FAR BUT MOST OF ALL IT DOESN'T ANNOY YOU BY OVERHEATING   BY A FEW MINUTES OF USE UNLIKE MANY OTHER PHONES WITH SNAPDRAGON. XPERIA Z WITH THE SAME SCREEN SIZE AND A 1.5 QUAD CORE PROCESSOR PRODUCES UNBEARABLE HEAT WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF USAGE. THAT'S A BIG RELIEF WITH THIS ONE.
      
      
      4. BATTERY LIFE: ANOTHER HUGE RELIEF IS IT'S LONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE. EVEN WITH SUBSTANTIAL USAGE, THE BATTERY DOESN'T THREATEN TO DIE EASILY. TRUST ME, A GOOD BATTERY LIFE IS A BIG ADVANTAGE TO HAVE IN A PHONE WITH THIS CONFIGURATION AND SCREEN SIZE.
      
      
      5. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS THE DUAL SIM FACILITY. I CAN USE MY WORK AND PERSONAL NUMBER IN THE SAME DEVICE. ONE DISAPPOINTMENT IS THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO RECOGNIZE A CDMA SIM EVENTHOUGH IT SAYS ON THE MICRO SIM SLOT THAT YOU CAN USE A CDMA SIM AS WELL.
      
      
      6. THE CAMERA IS JUST ABOVE AVERAGE, COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AT THIS PRICE. CAN GIVE YOU NICE SHOTS IN IDEAL LIGHT CONDITIONS. IT HAS GOT THE USUAL XPERIA FEATURES WHICH ARE NO MAGIC WAND.
      
      
      7. THE SCREEN SIZE WOULD MAKE OTHER PHONES LIKE IPHONE LOOK REALLY SMALL IN COMPARISON. YOU WOULD ENJOY GAMING, WANTCHING MOVIES AND PICS ON THIS ONE BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PHONE.
      
      
      8. DAMAGE WARRANTY: ANOTHER PLEASANT SURPRISE I GOT WHEN I RECEIVED IT WAS THAT SONY GIVES A FREE 6 MONTH PHYSICAL DAMAGE WARRANTY, MAKES ME EVEN HAPPIER ABOUT THE PRODUCT.
      
      
      THINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING IT:
      
      
      1. LOW INTERNAL STORAGE - 4 GB, VERY LOW USER AVAILABLE. BUT YOU CAN SET THE APPS INSTALLATION TO SD CARD.
      
      2. FRONT CAM IS JUST .3 MP, QUITE LOW AND DOESN'T SHOOT WELL.
      
      3. LOW AUDIO OUTPUT: YOU MUST BE EXPECTING A GREAT SOUND FROM SONY PHONES, BUT THIS ONE DOESN'T GIVE YOU A GREAT EXPERIENCE AS THE AUDIO OUTPUT IS VERY VERY LOW. IF YOU'RE PLUGGED IN A TRAIN, BUS OR SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE WAITING, YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ENJOY ANY SONGS AT ALL. TO CORRECT THIS, YOU WOULD HAVE TO INSTALL APPS LIKE SPEAKER BOOST, ETC. WHICH WILL SURELY BRING THE AUDIO LEVEL UP CONSIDERABLY.
      
      4. YOU CAN USE DATA SERVICES ON ONLY SIM 1, NOT ON SIM2.
      
      
      OVERALL NOT A BAD PHONE TO OWN!"
Xperia C,3,"CAMERA KEY PROVIDED ON THE SIDE OF THE SONY XPERIA C WORKS INTERMITENTLY AND DOESN'T LAUNCH CAMERA AND CLICK PICTURES ALL THE TIME AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT. IT WON'T WORK NO MATTER HOW HARD AND HOW LONG YOU PRESS IT. REST OF THE THINGS LOOK FINE. HENCE, I SUGGEST ALL YOU GUYS TO DOUBLE CHECK THE CAMERA KEY JUST BEFORE YOU PURCHASE IT."
Xperia C,3,FRONT CAMERA IS VERY BAD...AS COMPARE OF OTHER MOB IN SAME PRICE.....OTHER FEATURES ARE OK OK.....NOT BAD.
Xperia C,3,"GOOD MOBILE BUT AS SEEN IN THE PICTURE THERE IS NO PLAY STATION APP
      
      I BOUGHT IT FOR 20490 AND TODAY (10 DAYS LATER) IT IS 19149."
Xperia C,3,"GOOD PHONE OVERALL WITH GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY, HAS 5 INCH SCREEN, QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AND GOOD BATTERY LIFE BUT PALES OUT IN COMPARISON TO XPERIA SP WHICH IS PRICED A LITTLE MORE.
      
      HERE'S WHAT YOU I FOUND LACKING IN COMPARISON TO XPERIA SP:
      
      1. LESS INTERNAL MEMORY - 4 GB, SP HAS 5.8 GB USER ACCESSIBLE
      
      2. NO 4G
      
      3. NO GYRO SENSOR
      
      4. LOW PIXEL DENSITY, MIND YOU THE SCREEN IS NOT HD."
Xperia C,3,"GOOD:
      
      
      I AM USING THIS HANDSET FROM OCT 2013. I M HAPPY TO BROUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART ON DIWALI OFFER. MOBILE PERFORMANCE IS GOOD. NO HANG PROBLEM WHILE PLAYING GAME OR OPERATING MULTIPLE APPS. BATTERY BACKUP IS ONE DAY. RARE CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      
      BAD:
      
      
      SCREEN COLOR CONTRAST IS DULL. LITTLE BIT LAGGING WHILE PLAY HIGH RESOLUTION VIDEO. FRONT CAMERA IS VERY BAD. WE CAN NOT UNINSTALLED OR DELETE PRELOADED APPS FROM INTERNAL MEMORY. INTERNAL MEMORY SHOULD BE 8GB AS PER MOBILE PRICE."
Xperia C,3,"HI I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 3 DAYS BACK, THE PHONES LOOK IS VERY BEAUTIFUL &AMP; STYLISH. USER INTERFACE IS VERY GOOD, SPEED IS GOOD, EASY TO HANDLE, THERE IS NO LAGGING WHILE PLAYING HIGHER END GAMES ALSO. INTERNAL MEM IS LOW BUT ALSO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD APPS DIRECTLY TO SD CARD. THE ONLY THING I HATE ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE CAMERA, IT SUCKS, THE CAPTURE SPEED IS SLOW, IT WILL TAKE 3-4 SEC,  THE CLARITY IS OK, WHY I AM SAYING OK BECAUSE THE CAMERA IS OF 8MP, FOR 8MP THE PHOTO QUALITY MUST BE VERY GOOD, FRONT CAMERA IS VERY VERY BAD, I ALSO BOUGHT GALAXY CORE WHICH IS OF 12K+, THE GALAXY CORE'S FRONT CAMERA IS FAR BETTER THAN XPERIA C WHICK IS OF 19K +.
      
      FINALLY THE XPERIA C IS A GOOD PHONE EXCEPT THE CAMERA. SO IF YOU WANT A GOOD CAMERA PHONE DONT GO FOR XPERIA C. IF YOU ARE NOT INTERSTED IN CAMERA, BUT FOR THE GOOD USER INTERFACE PHONE GO FOR XPERIA C."
Xperia C,3,I BOUGHT MY XPERIA C FROM FLIPKART. ITS WORKING FINE BUT IS FULL HD RECORDING IS NOT EXACTLY FULL HD BUT INFACT SLIGHTLY LESS THAN HALF HD. EXCEPT THAT EVERY THING IS WORKING FINE AFTER 12 DAYS.
Xperia C,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 3 MONTHS BACK AND I'M IMPRESSED WITH THIS MID RANGE PHONE WHICH IS BETTER THAN SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND.....THIS IS A GOOD PHONE BUT HAS VERY LESS INTERNAL STORAGE WHICH MEANS LESS APPS BUT HAS A QUADCORE CPU OF A CHEAP BRAND WHICH IS OF NO USE WITH THIS MUCH STORAGE,,,NO ONE  CAN PLAY FANTASTIC GAMES SUCH AS ASPHALT 8 FIFA 14 AND REAL RACING 3 AND THE FREE HEADPHONE SI GOT WITH THEM SOUND MUCH BETTER WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY Y THAN THIS PHONE WHICH HAS CLEAR AUDIO+ BUT OF NO USE.....I'M SORRY TO SAY SONY YOU HAVE GIVEN THIS PHONE WHICH PERFECT FOR SOCIAL NETWORKING AS WELL AS FOR BROWSING NOW I APPOLOGIZE THAT I MADE A SERIOUS BUYING THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IF BOUGHT XPERIA SP INSTEAD OF THIS"
Xperia C,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART , BUT I WAS NOT THAT SATISFIED WITH THE PHONE. I EARLIER OWNED AN XPERIA L ,WHICH I GAVE TO MY SON , WERE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS.
      
      
      I'M GOING TO SHOW A SHORT COMPARISON BETWEEN XPERIA C AND XPERIA L..SORRY , I'M A VERY VERY SIMPLE USER AND MY SON IS AN ANDROID DEVELOPER SO I'M WRITING WHATEVER HE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THESE TWO PHONE..
      
      
      XPERIA C-
      
      
      1. DISPLAY- THIS HAS AN AMAZING DISPLAY AND HAS VERY RICH COLOURS . IT ALSO HAS VERY GOOD VIEWING ANGLES.
      
      
      XPERIA L
      
      
      1. XPERIA L ALSO HAS A VERY GOOD DISPLAY WITH UPTO THE MARK COLOURS. IT ALSO HAS GOOD VIEWING ANGLES.
      
      
      XPERIA C WINS IN THIS THINGY..
      
      
      _______________________________
      
      
      XPERIA C
      
      
      2. BODY- IT HAS A FINE BUILD QUALITY AND NOT THAT GOOD LOOKS BUT IT'S WAY BETTER THAN THOSE PLASTIC SAMSUNG THINGS AS IT HAS A RUBBER BACK. IT HAS RUBBER BACK IS VERY FINGERPRINT SENSITIVE.
      
      
      XPERIA L
      
      
      2. IT HAS AN AMAZING BUILD QUALITY AND HAS GREAT LOOKS AND IS CURVED FROM THE BACK. IT'S BACK DOES NOT EVEN CAPTURE ANY DUST. IT WILL LOOK NEW EVEN AFTER 1 OR 2 YEARS OF USAGE.
      
      
      XPERIA L WINS BY A MARGIN.
      
      
      ____________________________
      
      
      XPERIA C
      
      
      3. CAMERA - XPERIA C HAS A VERY GOOD CAMERA , WHICH IS ALMOST LIKE XPERIA Z1 .
      
      
      XPERIA L
      
      
      3. XPERIA L'S CAMERA IS NOTICEABLY PIXELATED.. BUT SINCE NO ONE IN MY FAMILY IS A HEAVY CAMERA USER SO IT WON'T MATTER US EVEN IF IT DIN'T EVEN HAVE A CAMERA.
      
      
      XPERIA C WINS HERE
      
      
      _________________________
      
      
      XPERIA C
      
      
      4. SCREEN - CAN BE EASILY BROKEN DOWN. IT IS 5 INCHES AND NOT GORILLA GLASS.STILL IT IS SCRATCH - RESISTANT AND DUST - PROOF.
      
      
      XPERIA L
      
      
      4. STURDY AND STRONG. 4.3 INCHES AND SEEMS QUITE STRONG. ONCE IT WAS TOSSED AWAY BY MY SON (WHO IS ALMOST 6 FEET) AND IT WAS STILL WORKING LIKE NEW.
      
      
      XPERIA L WINS!
      
      
      __________________________________
      
      
      XPERIA C
      
      
      5. HARDWARE AND GPU - IT HAS ONLY 4GB OF ROM. OUT OF WHICH ONLY AROUND 1.5GB IS USABLE. EVEN THOUGH THIS HAS A FINE GPU (IMG SGX544)  YOU CAN'T EVEN DOWNLOAD BIGGER GAMES BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED ROM. THERE IS NO ROOT OF XPERIA C SO YOU CAN'T ALSO PUT APPS IN SD CARD.
      
      
      XPERIA L
      
      
      5. IT HAS 8GB OF ROM. IT HAS A GOOD GPU VIZ ADRENO 305. IT CAN BE ROOTED. WHAT DO YOU NEED MORE :3
      
      
      XPERIA L DOMINATES YET AGAIN.
      
      
      ____________________________________________
      
      
      PLEASE GO FOR XPERIA L. I DID A MISTAKE BY BUYING XPERIA C. DON'T BUY C. IT IS NOT WORTH 20K.
      
      
      YOU CAN STILL GO FOR IT IF YOU ARE NOT A HEAVY USER AND NEED PHONE FOR CALLS, WHATSAPP AND RANDOM GAMES , WHICH IS ME.."
Xperia C,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON 23JNA14 AND UPDATED ITS SOFTWARE ON THE SAME DAY AFTER A MONTH OF HARDLY USING, SUDDENLY SWITCHED OFF ON ITS OWN, I COULD NOT MAKE IT LIVE.  AFTER  A LONG STRUGGLE, THRU SONY PC COMPANION(PHONE MANAGING SOFTWARE MUST BE INSTALLED ONE OF YOUR COMPUTER) GOT UPDATED AND INSTALLED.  NOW IT IS WORKING.  FOR WANT OF LATEST UPDATE THE PHONE SHOULD NOT GO DEAD.  OTHERWISE THE PRODUCT IS OK."
Xperia C,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON DEC 27 2013, RIGHT SINCE I GOT THIS PHONE ON MY HAND I COULD FEEL ITS GOOD BUILT QUALITY AND LESS WEIGHT STRUCTURE. NO BIG DESIGNS, BUT STILL IMPRESSIVE BY ITS OMNI BALANCE DESIGN. LET ME LIST THE CONS FIRST,
      
      CONS:
      
      1)DISPLAY ( TOO MUCH REFLECTIOND AND I COULD SEE THE DISPLAY HARDLY IN SUNLIGHT)
      
      2)DUAL SIM TECHNOLOGY(I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO TOGGLE BETWEEN TWO SIMS, NO HOT KEY AS THAT OF) LG MOBILES
      
      3)HANGS SOMETIMES BUT NOT OFTEN
      
      4) NO NFC! BUT NFC IS AVAILABLE IN SONY XPERIA M!
      
      5)VERY LOW PHONE MEMORY!!! ONLY 1.2 GB AVAILABLE!!! U COULD NOT DOWNLOAD ALL APPS OF YOUR WISH! ITS A BIG RESTRICTION!
      
      PROS:
      
      1)BUILT QUALITY, LIGHT WEIGHT
      
      2)SONY BRAND
      
      3)DECENT CAMERA
      
      4)ALL OTHER ASPECTS ARE GOOD!
      
      TOTALLY ITS AN AVERAGE PHONE.. IT WILL NOT DISSAPOINT U AFTER BUYING... DECENT PHONE... GIVES U A GOOD EXPERIENCE.. BETTER THAN NOKIA 1310, SAMSUNG GRAND..."
Xperia C,3,"I DO NOT KNOW WHY, BUT SONY PHONES SEEM TO HAVE THIS ISSUE. I WAS QUITE LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ONE BUT THOROUGHLY DISSAPOINTED WITH THE DISPLAY BRIGHTNES. EVEN AT MAX IT SEEMED DIM TO ME, THIS IS A DEAL BREAKER.
      
      
      I USED TO HATE SAMSUNG, BUT IF YOU COMPARE YOU WILL NOTICE THAT SAMSUNG'S DISPLAY IS QUITE BRIGHT COMPARED TO SONY."
Xperia C,3,"I HAVE ALMOST PLANNED TO BUY THIS MOBILE, BUT THEN AFTER GOING THROUGH ONE LIVE HANDSET FOR QUITE SOMETIME, I REALIZED THE FOLLOWING DRAWBACKS:
      
      1. THE DISPLAY IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING IF I AM COMPARING IT WITH SAME PRICE GROUP OTHER PHONES FROM OTHER BRANDS. THIS ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO BE A REASON TO NOT BUY IT.
      
      2. THE ICONS ARE SMALL AND LOOKS MORE LIKE CHEAP CHINESE MANUFACTURERS LIKE MICROMAX AND XOLO. THEY LOOK VERY ORDINARY IN THIS DEVICE, YOU WILL FEEL ONCE LIKE USING OLD ANDROID DEVICE.
      
      3. THE SOUND OUTPUT IS GOOD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS SAMSUNG'S 12000 PRICE GROUP PHONES.
      
      4. THE JELLY BEAN VERSION IS LATEST BUT LOOKS A LOT MESSED AND NOT AT ALL USER FRIENDLY.
      
      5. THE BUILD OF THE PHONE IS ALSO NOT AS GOOD AS SONY PHONES GENERALLY COME.
      
      
      THEREFORE WHAT I CONCLUDE, IT IS A GOOD OPTION IF THE PRICE WOULD HAVE BEEN AROUND 13K."
Xperia C,3,"I HAVE BOUGHT SONY XPERIA C FROM FLIPKART, THE PRICE I HAVE GOT FROM FLIPKART WHICH WAS INR 1200 LESS THAN LOCAL MARKET.
      
      
      I HAVE RECEIVED SONY HEADFONES FREE WITH IT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT WORKING.
      
      
      I REQUEST SUPPORT GUY TO EXCHANGE, BUT THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE, SO THEY GIVE ME CREDIT FOR 1490 TO MY WALLET
      
      
      OVERALL SERVICE FROM FLIPKART IS BEST EXCEPT THEIR COURIER SERVICE. IF THEY IMPROVE THEIR DELIVERY SYSTEM.
      
      
      WITH REGARD TO PHONE IS NOT ENOUGH GOOD IN TERMS OF SOUND. AUDIO QUALITY IS BAKWAS. YOU HAVE TO INSTALL SOUND BOOSTER.
      
      
      ALL OTHER FEATURES ARE FINE NOT BAD."
Xperia C,3,"I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO RATE THIS PHONE 5 STARS BUT ONLY FOR THE MEAGRE 4GB INTERNAL MEMORY. I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND SHE'S BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR JUST TWO WEEKS AND SHE ALREADY STATED GETTING A NOTIFICATION THAT THE INTERNAL MEMORY IS RUNNING LOW EVEN AFTER ADDING 32GB EXTERNAL SD CARD. THOUGH YOU CAN MOVE MANY APPS TO EXTERNAL MEMORY THERE ARE FEW VERY USEFUL APPS LIKE WHATSAPPS THAT CANNOT BE MOVED TO EXTERNAL MEMORY NOT TO MENTION THE NATIVE GOOGLE AND SONY APPS WHICH CANNOT EVEN BE UN-INSTALLED. AND YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT UPGRADE THE MEMORY ATLEAST WITH THIS GENERATION OF SMART PHONES. SO END OF THE DAY IT LEAVES YOU FRUSTRATED. SONY COULD HAVE ATLEAST ARM THIS WITH AN 8GB MEMORY. TOO BAD.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE WISE IT IS QUITE GOOD. FAST AND SLICK. DISPLAY IS ALSO QUITE DECENT. NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE REAR CAMERA EITHER, BUT FRONT FACING CAMERA IS A JOKE.
      
      
      IF YOU PLAN TO USE THIS PHONE MAINLY FOR THE BASIC FEATURES IT SHOULD SERVE THE PURPOSE, BUT IF YOU INTEND TO DOWNLOAD LOTS OF APPS THEN THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR YOU. IT WILL LEAVE YOU FRUSTRATED."
Xperia C,3,"ITS A MERE DISAPPOINTMENT FROM SONY!! NOT AT ALL EXPECTED.
      
      I HAD USED MICROMAX CANVAS HD, XOLO Q700 &AMP; XOLO Q800 BUT SONY XPERIA C IT WORST AMONG THESE IN TERMS OF FEATURES.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE WISE XPERIA C IS NOT AN ISSUE, HAVING SAME CONFIGURATION AS THAT OF XOLO Q800 I FOUND BOTH SAME.
      
      
      XPERIA C CAMERA IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT, THE CAMERA QUALITY OF XOLO Q800 AS BETTER THAN MY XPERIA C, I DNT KNOW IF I HAVE GOT A DEFECTED ONE BUT IT IS!
      
      
      AGAIN IN TERMS OF LOOKS ITS UNBELIEVABLE THAT ITS LOOKS SO ORDINARY XPERIA C IS TERRIBLE. IF PUT ASIDE MY XOLO Q800 AND Q700 ITS REALLY LUKS DABBA!!
      
      
      IN TERMS OF FEATURES FOR WHICH I LIKED MUCH ABT XOLO &AMP; MICROMAX WAS SIM MANGEMENT FEATURE IS MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN XPERIA C
      
      
      BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IS AFTER PAYING ALMOST 19K I COULD NOT DO 3G VIDEO CALL. SHIT IT IS!!! I GET SAME CONFIGURATION FROM XOLO &AMP; MICROMAX AT HALF OF THE PRICE WITH BEST OF FEATURES
      
      
      IF UR ARE HARDCORE PHONE DO NOT GO FOR IT.. I AM FEELING LYK CHEATED FROM SONY BUT LEFT WITH NO OPTIONS. I COULD HAVE FIRST CHECKED IT LOCALLY BEFORE ORDERING IT ONLINE BUT JUST ON NAME THAT SONY, I BROUGHT IT ONLINE N ITS A MERE WASTE OF MONEY!
      
      
      STRICTLY A BIG NO FOR XPERIA C"
Xperia C,3,"NO OPTION TO LINK THE LOCAL CONTACTS WITH FB OR GOOGLE.
      
      DIALER AND CONTACTS ARE NOT LINKED LIKE SMARTPHONE EG. IN XPERIA M DUAL OR OTHER PHONE.
      
      LESS OPTION IN DIALER.
      
      BASIC FEATURES SHOULD BE THERE AND REST ALL ARE OKAY.
      
      FOR REST OF FEATURES WITH THE WHICH I GOT THIS PHONE IT IS WORTH!!!!!!!!"
Xperia C,3,"PHONE IS VERY GOOD , BRIGHT DISPLAY , GOOD PROCESSING SPEED, GOOD GAMING EXPERIENCE.. BUT VERY DISAPPOINTING FACTOR IS ITS MUSIC. I CONNECTED SKULLCANDY AND SONY HEADPHONES TO LISTEN TO MUSIC BUT THE VOLUME AND EFFECTS ARE VERY VERY VERY BAD.. MY OLD PHONE IS FAR BETTER AND 3 TIMES GIVES GOOD SOUND EFFECTS THAN THIS . LISTENING TO MUSIC IN XPERIA C IS LIKE MICROMAX PRODUCT'S. NOT UPTO SONY STANDARDS.THIS PHONE WILL BE A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR MUSIC LOVERS."
Xperia C,3,PRICE ARE TOO MUCH HIGH ON FLIPKART SAME MOBILE ARE AVAILABLE IN SNAPDEAL AT RS 17000 THEN WHY WE SPEND RS 2900 MORE FROM FLIPKART
Xperia C,3,"SCREEN SIZE AND LOOKS ARE AMAZING , BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS AVERAGE, EVEN I FEEL GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN DO NOT RUN VERY SMOOTHLY. ALTHOUGH I WAS EXPECTING THIS BEFORE HAND FROM ALL THE REVIEWS THAT I WENT THROUGH, SO WAS NOT SHOCKED MUCH.
      
      SO IF YOU ARE A GAMER, OR VERY BUSY MOBILE USER , RESEARCH THOROUGHLY. FOR LIGHT CELL PHONE USERS ITS VERY GOOD.
      
      
      ALSO, I FIND THE VOLUME OF THE HEADSET TO BE VERY LOW AS COMPARED TO MY PREVIOUS CELLPHOMES, MAY BE ITS WITH MY PHONE ONLY. ANYBODY ELSE HAVING THIS PROBLEM."
Xperia C,3,"THIS HAS NICE HARDWARE AND SPECS BUT IS TO OVERPRICED AND THAT PRICE IT SHOULD HAVE A DISPLAY RESOLUTION FOR SUCH A BIG SCREEN AND WITH CURRENT SPECS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRICED AROUND 15K AND THIS PHONE WOULD HAVE ROCKED AND NO OTHER TILL NOW HAS THAT FEATURE LIKE IT AROUND 15K PRICE .
      
      
      VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH SONY .THIS MOBILE COULD HAVE CHANGED THE BUDGET PACE AND SONY COULD HAVE GOT SOME HIGH NUMBERS.THEY CAN STILL REDUCE THE PRICE AND SHOULD BRING IT AROUND 15K"
Xperia C,3,THIS PHONE HAS ALL THE FEATURES OF A GOOD AND NICE PHONE. THE LOOK IS TRENDY . EVEN PANASONIC HAS LAUNCHED MANY OFFERS ON THEIR PRODUCTS.
Xperia C,3,"WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE SAID IT IS HIGH PRICED BY SONY. IT SHOULD BE AROUND 15K.
      
      DISPLAY SIZE: IT IS 5"" WHILE 4.5"" WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT SIZE IN TERMS OF USAGES AND DISPLAY CLARITY WITH BATTERY BACK."
Xperia C,3,"XPERIA C IS AMAZING.
      
      GOOD SIZE
      
      GOOD CAMERA

Xperia C,2,I BOUGHT MY SONY XPERIA C FROM A NEARBY SHOP AT 18K..AND I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THE HOW BAD XPERIA CS CAMERA PERFORMS EVEN WITH THE EXMOR RS SENSOR..ITS LIKE CLICKING PICS FROM A 3MP CAMERA..ILL HIGHLY ADVICE BUYERS TO CHECK LEGITIMATE REVIEWS ON THE CAMERA RATHER THAN PAID ONES...OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS GOOD AS IN THE CASE OF PROCESSING POWER AND MUSIC..BUT IF SOMEONE LOOKING FOR A GOOD CAMERA PHONE..STAY AWAY FROM THIS...GO FOR GALAXY GRAND..ITS THE BEST BUDGET CAMERA PHONE WITHIN 20K..OR IF U WANT A LOCAL BRAND PHONE..THEN GO FOR XOLO 800Q OR XOLOQ1000..THEY HAVE DECENT PICTURE CLARITY..IF YOU WANT TO OVERLOOK THE CAMERA PERFORMANCE THEN ILL DEFINITELY SAY XPERIA C IS THE BEST BRANDED PHONE WITHIN 18K..AND SURELY A BANG FOR THE BUCK..
Xperia C,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 30TH OF OCT, THUMBS UP TO FLIPKART,S DELIVERY, EVERYTHING IN THIS PHONE WAS AWESOME BUT THE SIM CARD SLOT FOR SIM 2 IS NOT WORKING OFTEN, I COMPLAINED TO FLIPKART BUT DIDN'T GET ANY REPLACEMENT FOR THE MOBILE.. THE FREEBIE BLUETOOTH HEADSET SUPPLIED ALONG WITH X PERIA C WAS ALSO NOT WORKING, BUT THEY MADE REPLACEMENT FOR THAT. DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ARE NOT REPLACING THE PHONE.. STILL I'M USING SIM CARD SLOT ONE FOR MAKING CALLS N MSGING.. SIM CARD SLOT TWO NOT WORKING ALL THE TIME. ALL THE FUNCTIONS &AMP; SPECIFICATION IS OK BUT SECOND SIM CARD SLOT ONLY THE PROBLEM HERE.. I RECOMMEND THIS PHONE IF THE SPECIFIED PROB IS ELIMINATED."
Xperia C,2,"I BOUGHT XPERIA C FIRST ITS START HANG AND HANG AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH BATTERY HEATING ISSUE A DAY 4-6 TIMES SO I ASK FOR REPLACEMENT FLIPKART DID FOR ME NOW AGAIN IM FACING BATTERY ISSUE AND PHONE AUTOMATICALLY OFF WHEN SPEAKING SUCH A STRANGE ISSUE
      
      
      WS RETAIL AND FLIPKART IS SUPERB BUT SONY XPERIA C IS WASTE DUMP"
Xperia C,2,"PLZ DON'T BUY IT , IT CONSITS MEDIATEK PROCCER WCHICH ARE MAINLY USED IN MICROMAX ,LAVA,XOLO,ETC PHONES MEDIATEK IS A CHEAP CHINA MADE PROCER ITS HAS NO COMPETION WID QUALOM SNAPDRAGON PROCESSORS ............ THIS PHONE IS LAUNCHED 2 BEAR THE COMPITION WITH LOCAL INDAIN  MOBILES LKE MICROMAX ,INTEX, ETC  AND ITS PRICE ALSO TOO HIGH ... BUT IF U THINKING OF BUYING GALAXY GRAND THN SONY XPERIA C HAS 2 BE A GOOD CHOICE COMPARED 2 GALAXY GRAND......"
Xperia C,2,"SONY XPERIA C IS NOT WORTH FOR MONEY ITS ONLY POSITIVE THING IS BRAND NAME,DISADVANTAGE OF THIS PRODUCT BATTARY NOT REMOVEAVAL (SO ITS HANG YOU ONLY WAIT FOR BATTARY COMPLETLY DRY TO RESTART) VERY LOW INTERNAL MEMORY SO U ALWAYS OUT OF STORAGE AREA &AMP; MANY MORE SO PLZ DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
Xperia C,2,THIS IS BEST BUY @ 20K BUT THOSE U HAVE TIME TO WAIT PLZ WAIT FOR ANOTHER MONTH THE PRICE WILL FOR SURE GO DOWN TO 18K TO 19K.
Xperia C,2,"THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE BEST PHONE BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHER PLAYERS IN THE MARKET WHO ARE TAKING OVER THE GAME. PANASONIC IS ONE SUCH NAME ,AS THEY ARE OFFERING GREAT OFFERS.!!"
Xperia C,2,"THIS MOBILE IS JUST HAVING  BIGSCREEN AND 8MP PRIMARY CAM .DUAL SIM MOBILES THATS IT NOT HAVING ANY OTHER SONY STANDARA FEATURES LIKE NFC,DLNA, BETTER GO FOR XPERIA SP FOR THIS RANGE"
Xperia C,2,THIS SMARTPHONE FROM SONY IS VERY NICE. IT HAS ALL THE GREAT FEATURES. AMAZING PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY MAKES IT A BESTSELLER. PANASONIC HAS LAUNCHED MANY NEW OFFERS ON PRODUCTS.
Xperia C,2,XPERIA SP IS THE BEST MID RANGE SMARTPHONE RIGHT NOW. MOREOVER IT HAS A RESOLUTION OF 720P WHICH IS BETTER THAN THAT OF XPERIA C.
Xperia C,1,"1,WE CAN'T VIEW CALL LOG WHILE CALLING
      
      2,NO VIDEO CALL THROUGH NETWORK(AIRTEL,AIRCEL) . ITS TROUGH WIFI/GPRS USE THIRD PARTY APPLICATION LIKE SKYP, BINGO...."
Xperia C,1,"AN AVERAGE PHONE IN AVERAGE PRICE, TOUCH IS NOT SO GOOD AND THE OVERALL QUALITY DOES NOT MATCH THE NAME OF SONY..
      
      
      IN MY OPINION DON'T BUY THIS, BETTER TO BUY XPERIA SP...ITS FAR BETTER THEN THIS CRAP."
Xperia C,1,"BAKWAS PHONE.... BOUGHT ON 5TH NOV 2013 AND ITS DISPLAY IS DEAD ON 10TH NOV 2013 FOR NO REASON WHILE OPERATING ITS CAMERA.... DONT KNOW THE REASON... BUT SUCH THING IS NOT EXPECTED FROM SONY....
      
      
      BELOW 1 IS RATING FROM MY SIDE...."
Xperia C,1,BOUGHT IT ON 25TH DECEMBER '13 AND AS I TYPE THIS THE PHONE HAS BEEN INADVERTENTLY SWITCHED OFF AND ISN'T GETTING SWITCHED ON AGAIN. SO I DON'T THINK IM GOING TO SUGGEST ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE.
Xperia C,1,"BOUGHT SONY XPERIA C FROM FLIPKART ABOUT 20 DAYS BACK BECAUSE OF DUAL-SIM FEATURE... AND HAVE JUST OPENED THE BOX TO USE THE PHONE. HERE ARE MY QUICK OBSERVATIONS:
      
      
      ""GOOD"" ONES FIRST:
      
      
      AN AVERAGE TOUCHSCREEN PLAYED SPOILSPORT FIRST... I HAVE BEEN USING A LUMIA 720 FOR ABOUT AN YEAR NOW AND BELIEVE ME XPERIA TOUCHSCREEN QUALITY ISN'T EVEN 10% OF LUMIA'S.
      
      
      OVERALL USABILITY OF THE PHONE ISN'T SOMETHING TO BOAST OF EITHER... I AM NOT SMILING.
      
      
      NOW, THE ""BAD"" ONES:
      
      
      CAMERA IS THE WORST I HAVE USED IN YEARS. REMINDS ME OF PRE-VGA ERA. YES, PRE-VGA ERA! I AM ABROAD AT THE MOMENT AND FIRST THING I'LL DO AS SOON AS I AM BACK IN INDIA IS TO WRITE A STINKER TO SONY GUYS.
      
      
      A NOTE TO SONY:
      
      
      I NEVER LIKED SAMSUNG PHONES. I THOUGHT SONY WAS A BETTER COMPANY TO TRUST.
      
      MY OPINION NOW: DID ALL GOOD GUYS AT SONY JOIN SAMSUNG? LOOKS LIKE."
Xperia C,1,"CERTAINLY NOT THE PRICE !
      
      WHY TO BUY THIS WHEN YOU HAVE XPERIA SP , A MID RANGE PREMIUM PHONE FROM SONY AT ALMOST AROUND THE SAME PRICE ( 20 K AT PRESENT ) ?"
Xperia C,1,DO NOT PURCHASE SONY XPERIA C.IT HANGS REGULARLY FROM SAME MONTH OF PURCHASE.ITS VERY SAME FULL FOR THAT BRAND LIKE SONY.
Xperia C,1,"DONT EVER BELIEVE THE PRICING IN FLIPKART. THIS XPERIA C WAS PRICED AT 16-17K FEW DAYS BACK AND NOW THEY ARE TELLING EXCHANGE OFFER AND ALL SORT OF STUPID OFFERS AND THEY INCREASED THE ACTUAL PRICE.
      
      
      FINALLY THEY ARE SELLING WITH A SAME PRICE AFTER GETTING OUR OLD MOBILE..."
Xperia C,1,"EK NUMBE BAKWAS MOBILE, WAS DELIVERED YESTERDAY, NO MUSIC, NOT MUCH SOUND, VGA, BACKWAS UI, JUST LED DISPLAY WITH LOW RESOLUTION.....I WASTED 19000/ ON 1ST -JAN-2014 :("

Xperia C,1,"FIRSTLY FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE SCRATCHING THEIR HEAD UNDER CONFUSION AFTER READING ALL THOSE STUPID,IDIOTIC AND PATHETIC ENGLISH VOCABULARY STATING THE ODD'S OF SONY XPERIA C, JUST SIMPLY GET THE BEAST TO YOU. THIS IS A SUPERB PIECE FROM SONY AND SLIGHTLY OVERPRICED BUT DOES NOT MATTER. THOUGH THE SONY'S HAVE PLACED A CHINESE MEDIATEK PROCESSOR BUT ITS BETTER THAN THOSE PLASTIC MODELS OF SAMSUNG, MICROMAX,,,,, ETC. AL READY THE EXPERT USERS HAVE JOTTED DOWN THE PROS AND THE CONS OF THIS BEAST SO NO NEED TO WRITE ANYTHING ELSE. TRULY A MASTER PIECE WITH A STYLE STATEMENT."
Xperia C,1,"GOT THIS PHONE FOR 18K FROM FLIPKART - AS USUAL PACKING OF THE PHONE WAS EXCELLENT, FLIPKART TOOK 4 DAYS TO DELIVER. I INITIALLY THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. WHEN I FIRST STARTED TO GET THE  ""INTERNAL STORAGE RUNNING OUT ERROR""   - I THOUGHT, IT MAY BE BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE THE SD CARD. I GOT CLASS 10 SONY SD CARD WITH 32 G STORAGE. IT STILL KEPT GIVING ME ""INTERNAL STORAGE RUNNING OUT ERROR""  DESPITE HAVING 32 G MEMORY CARD, WHICH IS LESS THAN 10% FULL AND AFTER MOVING ALL MY APPS TO SD CARD. THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST COMPLAINT I HAVE FOR THIS PHONE. NOW, I AM NOT ABLE TO INSTALL ANY OTHER APP.  I AM HAVING A FELLING OF BEING LOCKED WITH THIS PRODUCT. I LOOKED UP ON SONY FORUMS ON INTERNET AND THERE WAS NO SOLUTION AVAILABLE .. NOT ONLY IS THIS PROBLEM WITH SONY XPERIA C - THIS IS ALSO CONTAGIOUS TO OTHER SONY PHONES LIKE XPERIA L.  SOME OTHER PROS AND CONS :
      
      
      PROS :
      
      1. SIZE IS EXCELLENT - SOME HAVE COMPLAINED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SMALLER. I FIND IT IDEAL.
      
      2. SONY HEADPHONES ARE EXCELLENT .. I USED TO USE SAMSUNG EARPHONE WHICH WENT INTO THE EAR.. THE FREE HEADPHONES THAT COMES WITH IT GIVE A PREMIUM LOOK AND ARE REASONABLY GOOD.
      
      3. SOUND IS OKAY - I WOULD NOT SAY GREAT WITH SPEAKERS.
      
      4. CAMERA IS OKAY - NOT GREAT.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      1. INTERNAL STORAGE IS TOO LESS - I KEEP GETTING ALERTS ABOUT INTERNAL MEMORY GETTING FULL DESPITE MOVING ALL APPS TO MY 32G MEMORY CARD . HIGHLIGHTED THIS IN MY REVIEW EARLIER.
      
      2. SOME APPS LAG LIKE ANYTHING .. I USED NOTES. AFTER COMPLETING ONE PAGE, THE APP HANGS LIKE ANYTHING .. NOT SURE IF THIS A PHONE THING OR ANAROID THING.
      
      
      YET TO USE THE DUAL SIM FUNCTIONALITY. I INITIALLY RECOMMENDED THIS PHONE TO OTHERS WHO WERE GOING FOR SAMSUNG - BUT, NOW I WOULD ROLLBACK MY RECOMMENDATION

      ALAS AM THANKFUL TO FLIPKART FOR REPLACING MY ORDER!!!!!!"
Xperia C,1,"HI,
      
      
      I HAVE PURCHASED A SONY XPERIA C AND THE PHONE WAS HAVING ISSUE WITH INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND I GOT IT REPLACED FROM FLIPKART AND THEN WITHIN A MONTH THE PHONE DISLPAY HAS GONE.
      
      I'M NOT SAYING THE PHONE IS NOT GOOD BUT I'M DOUBTING ON THE BRAND SONY BECAUSE FROM LAST 3 YEARS I HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH SONY PHONES.
      
      
      PLEASE THINK BEFORE PURCHASING."
Xperia C,1,"HI,
      
      
      I ORDERED XPERIA C ON FLIPKART AND TO SAY ABOUT FLIPKART, THEY DELIVERED FAST AND GOOD.
      
      
      BUT SONY, GOD. THE MOBILE HAS SENSOR PROBLEM AND APPROACHED SONY SERVICE AND THEY AGREED TO REPLACE BUT THE PROBLEM IS, IT SEEMS IT WILL TAKE FEW YEARS FOR THEM TO REPLACE IT.
      
      
      THE GREAT SONY SERVICE CENTER, THEY NEVER PICKUP CALL, EVER. FINALLY I TALKED TO SOME SENIOR EXECUTIVE AND HE PROMISED THAT THE MOBILE WILL BE DELIVERED ON TIME, HE TOLD THAT IT WAS HEAD OF SONY MOBILE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WHO GAVE THE DATE AND BOOM IT WAS NOT DELIVERED.
      
      
      I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS KIND OF SUPPORT FROM SONY AND I WAS TOLD ONE OF THE REASON THAT THEY CAN'T DELIVER THE MOBILE IS THAT THEY HAVE SO MANY PENDING CASES IN BANGALORE, THAT MEANS SO MANY COMPLIANT ON SONY MOBILE. ANYCASE WORST SERVICE I EVER FACED."
Xperia C,1,"I AM NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE SCREEN, BUT HOW IT FEELS WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT. COMPARE A SONY MOBILE SCREEN WITH THAT OF OTHER MOBILES SAMSUNG, LG, GIONEE, MICROMAX ETC.
      
      
      1)WHITE COLOUR - DIRTY WHITE WHEREAS IN OTHER CELLPHONE IT CLEAR BRIGHT WHITE
      
      2)BRIGHTNESS - DULL AT FULL BRIGHTNESS. IN EXPENSIVE MODELS YOU CAN SEE HAZINESS WHEN FULL BRIGHT.
      
      3)ITS DULL AND JUST NOT APPEALING.
      
      
      WAITED LONG TO BUY XPERIA C BUT I THINK ITS BETTER NOT TO BUY. ALSO RETAILER ASK NOT TO BUY SONY CELL PHONES AS THEY ARE PROBLEMATIC AND U'LL EVENTUALLY END UP IN THE SERVICE CENTRE.
      
      
      MY DAD HAS A ION WHICH AFTER 3MONTHS HAD TO BE TAKEN TO THE SERVICE CENTRE FOR CAMERA PROBLEM. PATHETIC. AND YA SAME DULL DISPLAY.
      
      
      DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH SONY."
Xperia C,1,"I BOUGHT SONY XPERIAC LAST MONTH AND TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE BUY. THE BATTERY BACKUP IS REALLY BAD WITH WIFI ON (FROM 70% TO 7%) IN 6 HOURS. THE DISPLAY GETTING BLURRED OCCASIONALLY. ON 3RD FEB I GOT A MESSAGE TELLING THERE IS A SYSTEM UPDATE AVAILABLE AND I FOLLOWED THE STEPS AS MENTIONED THE SONY SUPPORT SITE. THE UPDATE FAILED AND THE PHONE DIDN'T START AFTER THAT. I WENT TO THE SONY SUPPORT CENTER(ABHIVRUDHI TECH, BANGALORE, KARNATAKA) THE RESPONSE WAS PATHETIC, THE GIRL ATTENDED WAS ASKING FOR  THE ORIGINAL BILL AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE, THERE WAS NO-ONE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS THE PROBLEM AND WHAT CAN BE DONE. FINALLY SHE TOLD THAT I WILL LOSE ALL THE DATA AND THE PHONE SOFTWARE HAS TO RESET. SINCE I LEFT WITH NO OTHER OPTION, AGREED FOR THE SAME. AFTER THAT SEND A MAIL TO SONY SUPPORT ABOUT THE SAME THE REPLY SAYS, PROVIDE THE WORK DETAILS AND IF I AM NOT RESPONDING WITHIN 3 DAYS THEY WILL CLOSE THE TICKET. I HAVE ANOTHER PHONE HUAWEI ASCEND 300, IT'S WAY BETTER THAN THIS PHONE(PRICE RS 7K).

Xperia C,1,"I DIDN'T BUY THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART!! I OWN THIS PRODUCT FROM SOME OTHER RETAILER AND I FELT BAD FOR THIS PHONE.
      
      1. PHONE IS COMPLETE JUNK IN MANY WAYS
      
      2. I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF SAMSUNG... WHERE AS WE CONSIDER THIS PHONE AS A COMPETITOR FOR SAMSUNG GRAND DUOS...
      
      3. WITH THE SAME COST SAMSUNG GRAND IS 1000 TIMES BETTER....
      
      4. INTERNAL 4 GB (USABLE 1 GB) MEMORY IS REALLY FRUSTRATES ME WHEREAS SAMSUNG GRAND GIVES YOU 8 GB (USABLE 4 GB).. WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME PHONE WILL POP OUT SAYING STORAGE SPACE IS FULL :(
      
      5. WORST CAMERA CLARITY... 8 MP OF THIS PHONE IS EQUAL TO PRIMARY CAMERA OF ANY PHONE..
      
      6. IF YOU USE PHONE FOR TALKING LONG MORE HEATING AND ALSO WHILE CHARGING THE PHONE.
      
      7. I CONSIDER THIS PHONE IS A SCRAP....
      
      8. SONY DISAPPOINTED ME...
      
      9. SONY PRICE IS ALWAYS HIGH BUT THEY NEVER COMPROMISE WITH THEIR QUALITY BUT NOW FOR A COMPETITION SONY ALSO DOING SUCH THINGS BAD.....
      
      10. NO WORTH BUYING :( FOR THIS COST"
Xperia C,1,"I GOT MY XPERIA C REPLACED.IT WAS HAVING SOFTWARE PROBLEM.IT WAS MY BAD XPERIENCE.I WAS NOT XPECTING THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM FROM SONY.
      
      ANYWAYS THANKS TO FLIPKART FOR REPLACING IT."
Xperia C,1,I HAVE PURCHASED SONY XPERIA C ON FLIPKART.IN WHICH BOX SONY XPERIA HEADPHONE NOT RECIVED. IT IS BAD EXPERIENCE. SO PROVIDE ME MY ORIGNAL HEADPHONE
Xperia C,1,"I HAVE USED MANY MOBILE PHONES STARTING WITH NOKIA BUT NEVER REGRETED BUYING A CELL AS MUCH AS I AM REGRETING BUYING ""SONY XPERIA C"".
      
      YOU INVEST 20,000 ON A CELL PHONE AND IT STARTS GIVING YOU PROBLEMS JUST AFTER 1AND HALF MONTH SO MUCH SO THAT YOU HAVE NO OPTION BUT TO VISIT SONY'S SERVICE CENTER AND AFTER YOU VISIT SONY'S SERVICE CENTER YOU ARE LEFT HELPLESS WITH THE PATHETIC NATURE OF SONY'S SERVICE.
      
      THE WAY CUSTOMERS ARE TREATED AND THE SERVICE PROVIDED MAKES YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD HAVE BURNT YOUR MONEY INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN SONY MOBILE PHONE.
      
      THE OVERALL QUALITY OF SONYS MOBILE PHONE AND SERVICE IS SO PATHETIC YOU ARE LEFT SPEECHLESS AND HELPLESS.
      
      ITS MY HONEST REQUEST TO ANYONE INTENDING TO BUY SONY'S MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD BE BETTER OF BUYING A CHEAP HANDSET OF ANY OTHER COMPANY ON WHICH YOU WILL BE SAVED OF ENDURING PAIN OF WASTING MONEY ON A WORTHLESS MOBILE PHONE."
Xperia C,1,"I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEATHER IT'S A SONY PHONE OR A CHINA MADE ITEM
      
      I DOUBT THAT SONY HAS A COLLABARATION WITH CHINA MADE FIRMS
      
      ITS NOTHING BUT A CLEAN BULLSHIT
      
      PURE WASTAGE OF MONEY N NOTHING ELSE

Xperia C,1,"I RECEIVED THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART JUST A WEEK BACK. WHEN I INSERTED MY BOTH SIMS AND IT'S DOESN'T ABLE TO SENSE NETWORK AT ALL.
      
      I EVEN UPGRADED THE PHONE SOFTWARE BUT THAT STILL DOEN'T HELP THE PHONE TO FIX THIS ISSUE. I AM NOW ONLY USING SIGLE SLOT AT A TIME FOR CALLS.
      
      THIS PHONE HAS A GOOD LOOK AND FEEL, HOWEVER THERE IS A DEFINITE BUG IN THE DUAL SIM CONFIGURATION.
      
      PROS:
      
      1. LOOK AND FEEL
      
      2. HD SUPPORT AND VIDEO
      
      3. MUSIC
      
      CONS:
      
      1. DUAL SIM BUG
      
      2. POOR CAMERA QUALITY
      
      3. VERY LIMITED INTERNAL STORAGE"
Xperia C,1,"LOOKS MEIN ACHA HA KILLER HA BOSS, BUT SCREEN AUR PROCESSOR KHRAB LGAYA SONY WALO NE, GORILLIA GLASS BHI NAI LGAYA. 20000 KASE LE RAHE HO SONY WALO ?????"
Xperia C,1,MY CELLPHONE BACK COVER IS FADED AND EVEN IT HAS SOME BUG PROBLEM AND I WANT IT TO BE REPLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SIR AND EVEN ITS FREE HEADPHONE IS FOR E DUAL NOT FOR SONY C AND EVEN LOOKS OLD
Xperia C,1,ONLY 4GB OF INTERNAL MEMORY. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I THOUGHT OF BUYING THIS MOBILE BUT AFTER KNOWING IT HAS ONLY 4GB OF INTERNAL MEMORY I DROPPED MY IDEA. COMPARING TO THIS PHONE XPERIA SP IS THE BETTER OPTION.
Xperia C,1,"PLEASE DON'T GO FOR SONY XPERI C, XPERIA C IS NOT AT ALL USER FRIENDLY LIKE SAMSUNG,HTC AND NOKIA,  MICROMAX PRODUCTS ARE FAR BETTER THAN XPERIA C.VIDEO CALLING FACILITY IS NOT AVAILABLE WHILE USING 3G ENABLED NETWORK. BATTERY BACKUP IS NOT GOOD. IT'S NOT WORTHY"
Xperia C,1,"REAL EXPERIENCE:
      
      I HAVE BOUGHT SONY XPERIA C  COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, JUST AFTER ONE HOUR OF USE THE A FINE LINE APPEARED ON THE SCREEN. WHICH MEANS THIS PHONE HAS SOME ISSUES IN DISPLAY . CHECK TWICE OR THRICE BEFORE BUYING.
      
      WITH THE PHONE SONY GIVES A 6 MONTH DAMAGE WARRANTY THAT MEANS SONY WILL REPLACE THE PHONE FOR ANY WEAR AND TEAR, SOON AFTER YOU SUBMIT THE PHONE IN STORE ROOM, BUT THIS HAS TAKEN ME AROUND 5 DAYS TO GET.
      
      
      NOW THE COMES THE INTERNAL STORAGE ISSUE:IN SPECS IT IS GIVEN THE PHONE HAS 4GB INTERNAL MEMORY BUT USEABLE MEMORY IS ONLY 1.2 GB , WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THIS..??
      
      
      FOLKS PLEASE MAKE SURE EACH AND EVERY ASPECT OF THIS PHONE BEFORE BUYING."
Xperia C,1,"THE FRONT CAMERA IS JUST LIKE HELL
      
      PHONE HANGS
      
      CANT DOWNLOAD APPS FROM PLAYSTORE
      
      TOUCH DOESNT WORK
      
      REQUESTED FOR A REFUND FROM FLIPKART AND GOT THE REFUND"
Xperia C,1,"THE PRODUCT IS PRICED VERY HIGH !
      
      IT'S REALLY NOT WORTH THE PRICE.
      
      AS THE CHEAPER MEDIATEK PROCESSOR IS USED , IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PRICED ABOVE 15 K FOR SURE."
Xperia C,1,"THIS MIGHT BE REVIEWED AS BEST PHONE BUT GUYS FIRST LOOKS MIGHT BE DECEIVING, PANASONIC HAS LAUNCHED NEW PHONES ALONG WITH OTHER PRODUCTS AND THAT TOO WITH HUGE DISCOUNT OFFERS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Xperia C,1,"THOUGH THIS PHONE HAS A BETTER SCREEN RESOLUTION STILL VIEWING ANGLE OF THIS PHONE IS NOT GREAT.
      
      
      BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE PROCESSOR... QUALCOMM IS NO1 CHIP SET MANUFACTURER, HIGHEND SMARTPHONE USES ITS SNAPDRAGON SERIES LIKE HTC ONE,S4,OPTIMUS G,LUMIA920.  GRAND IS USING BROADCOM USA WHICH IS COMPARATIVELY SAME AS QUALCOMM IN TERMS OF QUALITY. BUT XPERIA C USING  MEDIATEK CHIPSET. WHICH IS GREAT IN TERMS OF QUANTITY.  MOST OF THE CHINESE MOBILE COMPANY USE MEDIATEK CHIPSET.AS YOU SEE IN MICROMAX,KARBON,LAVA BUT THEIR QUALITY IS VERY VERY POOR IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE.IF YOU GO FOR MEDIATEK PROCESSOR AT THIS PRICE THEN WHY DONT YOU GO FOR CHEAP CHINESE CRAP WHICH ARE JUST HALF THE PRICE OF XPERIA C HAVING SAME MEDIATEK QUAD CORE PROCESSOR WHERE C STANDS FOR CHINA.
      
      
      STORAGE IN XPERIA C  4GB INTERNAL EXPANDABLE UPTO 32GB WHEREAS ONLY .97GB+600MB SYSTEM MEMORY AVAILABLE FOR USERS ONLY.WHICH IS VERY VERY LESS ,REALLY ANNOYING FOR THIS PHONE.SO YOU VE VERY LESS OPTION TO STORE HIGH END GAMES OR APPS.
      
      
      FRONT FACING CAMERA IN XPERIA C 0.3MP . 0.3 MP SEEMS TO BE A VGA CAMERA GIVES YOU GRANNY IMAGE WHILE VIDEO CALLING OR FRONT SELF SHOOTING.
      
      
      XPERIA C HAS A BETTER BATTERY BUT DUAL SIM WITH SPECIALLY CHEAP MEDIATEK CHIP SET DONT EXPECT GREAT PERFORMANCE BECAUSE MEDIA TEK QUAD CORE IS HIGHLY BATTERY CONSUMABLE.
      
      
      AND BECAUSE OF UNIBODY DESIGN XPERIA C HAS NON REMOVABLE BATTERY,SO NO OPTION FOR CARRYING AN EXTRA BATTERY TO USE IN EMERGENCY AND WHEN BATTERY DIES YOU VE TO GO TO SERVICE CENTER FOR REPLACEMENT, WHICH COST EXTRA SERVICE CHARGE AND EXPENSIVE THAN THE MARKET PRICE.
      
      
      XPERIA C IS MISSING SOME OF THE IMPORTANT SENSOR LIKE GYROSCOPE WHICH IS USED TO MEASURES THE ORIENTATION OF THE DEVICE. IT CAN SENSE MOTION INCLUDING VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL ROTATION.USES IN HIGHEND GAMES LIKE COUNTER STRIKE.IN SUCH GAMES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MOVE IN ALL DIRECTIONS WHICH ALSO INVOLVES ROTATION AROUND GRAVITY. AGAIN WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF GYROSCOPE,  WE NEED TO DRAG A FINGER ON THE TOUCH SCREEN TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION AND WE HAVE TO AGREE THAT AFTER A WHILE WE WILL BEGAN TO REALIZE THE UNFRIENDLINESS OF THE SYSTEM, IN SHORT IT WILL GET ANNOYING.
      
      
      AND MOST IMPORTANT NO ONE NOTICE ABOUT SONY PHONE WHERE BACK AND MENU TOUCH BOTTONS ARE THE PART OF THE SCREEN WHICH BLOCK SOME PART OF THE SCREEN DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE FULL 5INCH SCREEN AS MENTION IN THEIR FEATURE LEFT 4.7INCH SCREEN.
      
      
      SO WITH CHEAP MEDIATEK PROCESSOR THAT SONY USED FIRST TIME WHICH IS NOT SONY STANDARD, VGA FRONT FACING CAMERA AND LOWEST INTERNAL MEMORY AND ALMOST 3000-4000 EXTRA PRICING , NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY."

Xperia J,5,"ACC.TO ME ITS A WONDERFUL PHONE AT ARANGE OF16.5K.I HAVE THIS SMARTPHONE FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW. I BOUGHT IT MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN AND THE SCREEN SIZE. I KNEW ITS SINGLE-CORE PROCESSOR WOULD COMPROMISE MY XPERIA/ANDROID EXPERIENCE, BUT I THOUGHT I COULD DEAL WITH IT 'CAUSE I'M NEITHER INTO HEAVY GAMING NOR INTO USING DEMANDING APPS. THE WALKMAN APP IS ALL I NEED TO KEEP ME ENTERTAINED. AND THE FILMS APP, TOO. SO IF YOU'RE NOT TOO MUCH OF A HEAVY USER AND YOUR BUDGET CAN'T BE STRETCHED TOO FAR FOR YOU TO HAVE AN XPERIA T OR V, THEN XPERIA J IS THEIR SIBLING THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU."

Xperia J,5,"FIRST OF ALL THANKS FLIPKART .. AWESOME WORK ... DELIEVERED THE PHONE IN 2 DAYS ... :D

      IT WILL RUN LIKE CHARM WITHOUT ANY LAG ... IF MANY UNWANTED SERVICES KEEP RUNNING THEN OFCOURSE EVERY PHONE LAGS .

      CONS :
      
      NO HD VIDEO RECORDING"
Xperia J,5,"FRIENDS, I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE LAST 1.5 MONTH, SO I AM SHARING MY EXPERIENCE WITH XPERIA J. I WAS LOOKING FOR A PHONE WHERE I WAS NOT INTERESTED TO CARRY CHARGER EVERYWHERE I GO, IT MEANS I NEEDED A PHONE WITH BETTER BATTERY BACKUP, XPERIA J PASSED IN THIS CRITERIA WITH 1700MAH BATTERY, CAPABLE ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU SATISFIED, EVEN IF YOU ARE OUT FOR THE WHOLE DAY ON TRIP.
      
      SECONDLY, I WAS LOOKING FOR A PHONE WHICH GIVES ME GOOD FEELING WHILE NET SURFING. I AM NOT QUITE SURE, HOW THE OTHER MOBILES IN THIS RANGE ARE PERFORMING IN THIS AREA, BUT XPERIA J WILL SURELY KEEP YOU HAPPY, EVEN IF YOU CHECK, THE SURFING SPEED VALUE FOR 2G AND 3G INTERNET PROVIDED BY SONY IS SOMEWHERE HIGHER AS COMPARE TO THE OTHER MOBILES VALUE, AND IT REALLY WORKS THAT WAY, THOUGH I AGREE WITH YOU, THE WORKING INTERNET SPEED IS DEPENDENT ON SERVICE PROVIDER. I CAN WATCH THE COMPLETE VIDEO IN YOUTUBE IN 2G, WITH BUFFERING STOPPAGE OF 3-4 TIMES WHILE BROWSING, BUT GUYS, JUST MARK THE SPEED, IT IS CAPABLE EVEN IN 2G GPRS SERVICE TO SHOW YOU VIDEO. I HAVE BEEN USING INTERNET RADIO AND SAAVN ON REGULAR BASIS TO LISTEN MUSIC VIA, 2G GPRS SERVICE AND IT WORKS ABSOLUTELY FINE.
      
      
      USB TETHERING AND WIFI TETHERING WORKS PERFECT FOR ME.
      
      
      IT'S LOOK IS A KILLER LOOK......I NEVER FOUND THAT NECESSARY THAT MY PHONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH 1GB RAM BY SONY, THOUGH IT COULD HAVE REALLY INCREASED THE PERFORMANCE...512MB WORKS GOOD, AND NOWHERE MAKES YOU UNHAPPY.
      
      
      TEMPLE RUN LOVERS, NEED NOT WORRY, THIS PHONE WILL NEVER LAG. IT WORKS FINE.
      
      
      THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKED IS THE ENCLOSED EARPHONE BY SONY, IS NOT WORTH THE QUALITY, BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE A NEW EARPHONE PURCHASED, AND THIS CANNOT BE THE REASON TO REJECT XPERIA J.
      
      SO GO FOR IT, AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET FOR SURE, WHO WANT'S A DECENT BUY WITH TRUSTWORTHY BRAND."
Xperia J,5,"GO AND BUY THIS PHONE BUT ITS GOT SOME LAG ISSUES.LAGS ON HEAVY GAMES.UI IS AMAZING,CAMERA IS TOO GOOD,BATTERY BACKUP IS FINE.RAM SHOUL BE MORE...OVERALL BEST PHONE IS ITS RANGE...BETTER THAN WINDOWS PHONE(620,520)
      
      SHUTS LIKE A TV...ITS FUNNY WITH EXPERIA J...
      
      AT LAST IT GOT ANDROID OS...2ND TO MAC OS...
      
      CAN DO ANYTHING U CAN DO WITH EVERY OTHER PHONE....."
Xperia J,5,"HEY GUYS
      
      XPERIA J IS IS AN AWESOME PHONE IN ITS PRICE RANGE. I WON'T MENTION THE SPECIFICATIONS AGAIN . THE PHONE GIVES A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE OF ICS AND TIMESCAPE INTERFACE OF SONY.
      
      
      FIRSTLY THE THE PHONE IS VERY HIGH ON LOOKS SPECIALLY THE WHITE COLOUR. YOU CAN ALSO GET SAMSUNG S DUOS FOR SAME PRICE BUT S DOUS WON'T MATCH ITS LOOKS.
      
      IF YOU ARE A BIG MUSIC LISTENER, THE THIS PHONE WAS BUILT FOR YOU! ITS SPEAKERS ARE GREAT. THEY COME WITH SONY'S X LOUD ENHANCEMENT AND ARE LOUD ENOUGH. EVEN AT HIGH VOLUME LEVEL THEIR IS NO SOUND DISTORTION. THE PHONE COMES WITH WALKMAN MUSIC PLAYER WITH A VERY NICE INTERFACE.
      
      GAMING EXPERIENCE IS ALSO GOOD. YOU CAN PLAY ALL THE CLASSICS LIKE ANGRY BIRD, TEMPLE RUN ETC. GRAPHICS ARE GOOD. IF YOU WANT A PRO GAMING EXPERIENCE YOU CAN BUY XPERIA U WHICH IS CHEAPER THAN XPERIA J BUT HAS A SMALL SCREEN AND HAS LOW VOLUME.
      
      CAMERA IS ALSO FINE. THOUGH IT IS NOT THAT GOOD AS COMPARED TO A DIGITAL CAMERA BUT IT IS FINE.
      
      BATTERY IS ALSO GOOD. NO NEED TO CHARGE TWICE A DAY AS IN MOST OF THE ANDROID PHONES. YOU CAN USE IT FOR MULTIMEDIA PURPOSES ALL DAY.
      
      ITS SCREEN IS AMAZING. PIXELS ARE NOT VISIBLE . VIDEO PLAYBACK IS GOOD THOUGH IT CANNOT PLAY HD VIDEOS. IF YOU WAN'T HD VIDEOS PLAYBACK THEN YOU CAN CHECK OUT XPERIA NEO L WHICH IS AROUND RS. 18000.
      
      OVERALL THIS PHONE IS A GREAT PRODUCT FROM SONY.  IF YOU WAN'T A GREAT PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE THEN GO FOR IT. YOU CAN ALSO CHECK OUT SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS, HTC ONE V, NOKIA 710 AND I PHONE 3G."
Xperia J,5,"HI I HAVE BEEN PLANNING TO BUY A SMART PHONE FOR A LONG TIME AND MY IDEAL PHONE WAS SAMSUNG GALAXY SII BUT DUE ITS HIGH COST ITS OUT OF MY BUDGET, BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A PHONE WITH ALMOST SAME FEATURES BUT WITHIN 15K, THAT IS RUBBISH ITS NOT POSSIBLE....
      
      AFTER A LOT OF RESEARCH READING ABOUT ALL THE ASPECTS, HARDWARE CONFIGURATION, ANDROID OS VERSION, GPU EFFECTS, SCREEN SIZE, CAMERA CONFIGURATION. I WONDERED WHY THERE CANT BE A SINGLE SET FROM EVERY MANUFACTURE WHICH COULD SATISFY EVERY MENTIONED QUALITY  TO BE PRESENT IN THAT SET AND THAT SHOULD BE THE ULTIMATE IN ITS SEGMENT, THEN I WONDERED IF THAT SET IS LAUNCHED IN THE MARKET WITHIN A RANGE OF 20K THEN EVERY OTHER SET WILL NOT BE SOLD.
      
      
      SO 1ST THING PRIORITIZE WHAT YOU WANT FROM YOUR PHONE AND BELIEVE ME IF YOU WANT IT WITHIN YOUR BUDGET YOU WOULD HAVE TO SACRIFICE/COMPROMISE WITH SOME LESS GRADED OTHER FEATURES.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. SCREEN SIZE 4"", LOOKS GOOD IN HAND.
      
      2. OS ANDROID V4 (ICE CREAM SANDWICH) MOST PROBABLY UP-GRADABLE TO ANDROID V4 (JELLY BEANS)[BUTTER PROJECT OF GOOGLE, TO IMPROVE THE GRAPHICS, INCLUDE GOOGLE VOICE SEARCH, GOOGLE MAPS OF CITIES CAN BE DOWNLOADED, UNLOCK SCREEN WILL BE CHANGED ETC]
      
      3. PROCESSOR IS FINE AND SO IS THE USER INTERFACE(TIMESCAPE)
      
      4. SCRATCH RESISTANT SCREEN AND SONY BRAVIA ENGINE.
      
      5. WITHIN RANGE UNDER 16500RS
      
      6. CAMERA FOR STILL PHOTOGRAPHS IS GOOD, WITH LED FLASH
      
      7. SECONDARY CAMERA(VGA) FOR VIDEO CALL OVER VOIP, INTERNET.
      
      8. BATTERY IS 1700MAH... PROVIDES BETTER BATTERY BACKUP.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. GPU (GRAPHICAL PROCESSING UNIT) IS ADRENO 200, THIS ATLEAST            COULD HAVE BEEN ADRENO220, IF NOT MALI400MP
      
      GPU-&GT; HELPS IN PLAYING HEAVY GAMES, HD GAMES, HIGHER THE GPU   LESSER IS LOAD ON PROCESSOR AND RAM.
      
      2. RAM 512 IDEALY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1GB, BUT THEN IT WOULD HAVE BECOME AN IDEAL PHONE.
      
      3. VIDEO RECORDING IS NOT HD VIDEO, FOR ME ITS NOT IMP ASPECT I DON'T MAKE THAT MUCH VIDEOS BUT I GUESS VGA VIDEOS ARE NOT THAT BAD.
      
      4. INTERNAL MEMORY IS FINE AS YOU CAN BUY AN EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD AND ICS ALLOWS USER TO SAVE AND RUN APPLICATIONS FROM MEMORY CARD.
      
      
      I HAVE DECIDE TO BUY THIS PHONE BUT IT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN RETAIL STORES.
      
      
      THIS IS A GOOD BUY.
      
      
      U CAN BUY IT IN CHEAP PRICES FROM OTHER SITES BUT THEY WON'T BE GIVING MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY, THEY WILL GIVE YOU DEALER'S WARRANTY.GOOGLE ABOUT THIS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND."
Xperia J,5,"I AM TOTALLY EXCITED WITH THIS PHONE..!

Xperia J,5,"I BOUGHT THIS SMART PHONE AROUND 6 MONTHS BACK AND CAN SAY IT'S WORKING REALLY GOOD.
      
      THE DISPLAY IS WAY BETTER THAN SAMSUNG. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH END GAMES IT DIES. BUT I HARDLY PLAY GAMES IN THE PHONE. BEST ONE LOVED IT"
Xperia J,5,"I HAD PURCHASE THIS PHONE ON 1ST JAN.13 . IT IS VERY NICE PHONE  IN THIS RANGE .IT IS PARTICULARELY MADE FOR THOSE HAVING CRAZE OF MUSIC AND PHOTOGRAPHY I THINK . BUT OVERALL  IT IS NICE EXPRIENCE .
      
      DISPLAY CLEARITY IS AWASOM  USERFRIENDLY .ONLY HEAD PHONE IS NOT UPTO LEVEL OF SONY BRAND ."
Xperia J,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR AROUND 20 DAYS NOW AND I MUST SAY..ITS SIMPLY AWSOME.IT REALLY GIVES THE LOOKS OF A HIGH RANGE PHONE BUT IS VERY MUCH AFFORDABLE.AND THE COMPLIMENTS YOU GET FOR THE PHONE WILL SIMPLY MAKE U NEGLECT THE FEW CONS THAT THIS GORGEOUS PIECE OF BEAUTY HAS.NOW:
      
      PROS:
      
      -AWESOME LOOKS
      
      -VERY IMPRESSIVE AND ATTRACTIVE LED ILLUMINATION.
      
      -GORGEOUS CURVY BACK LOOK AND RUBBER FINISH BACK COVER
      
      -THOUGH ADRENO 200,BUT THE SCREEN IS SIMPLY AWESOME DUE TO HIGH PPI.
      
      -BEST UI AVAILABLE IN MKT.
      
      -CAN HANDLE MOST OF THE NORMAL GAMES.NOT THE ONES HAVING HIGH END GRAPHICS THOUGH.
      
      -DOES NOT HANG A LOT.(I READ SOME REVIEWS SAYING THAT IT HANGS A LOT BUT TRUST ME GUYS IT DOES NOT)
      
      -VERY GOOD ENTERTAINMENT BASIS PERFORMANCE,CAN PLAY HD VIDEOS EASILY.
      
      
      CONS-
      
      -HEADPHONES COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PLUS THEY GIVE WHITE HEADPHONES WITH BLACK SET,WHICH IS NOT VERY LOGICAL AND PLEASING.
      
      -SLIGHT ECHO WHILE ON CALL SOMETIMES.GOD KNOWS WHY.BUT VERY SLIGHT.
      
      -MAJOR ONE-ITS MIC'S SENSITIVITY GOT REDUCED IN 15 DAYS OF USAGE AND IT STOPPED WORKING.HAD TO GO TO SERVICE CENTRE WHERE THEY REPLACED THE MIC.THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN MANY XPERIA J AS ACCORDING TO SERVICE CENTRE TECHNICIAN THE MICS OF J ARE APPARENTLY NOT THAT SUITABLE TO INDIAN CONDITIONS.BUT NOW ITS BEEN REPLACED AND IS WORKING FINE.
      
      -CAMERA QUALITY IS AWESOME IN DAYLIGHT,NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE WITH FLASH AT NITE TYM OR WITHOUT FLASH TOO.
      
      
      ALL AND ALL I AM VERY MUCH SATISFIED BY MY DEVICE N WILL GIVE IT 5 STARS.ITS A GOOD DEAL.GO AHEAD AND BUY IT.
      
      THANK YOU."
Xperia J,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM EBAY IN 12.3K ...IN THIS PRICE NO ONE CAN BEAT THIS PHONE AS PER AS BRANDED PHONE ARE CONCERN.
      
      
      PROS
      
      1. VERY CRISP AND BRIGHT DISPLAY
      
      2. VERY GOOD AUDIO QUALITY OF SPEAKER(LOUD AND CLEAR)

Xperia J,5,"I HAVE JUST SWITCHED FROM USING A SAMSUNG CORBY TO THE SONY XPERIA J AFTER MUCH THOUGHT AND READING A MILLION REVIEWS POSTED ALL OVER THE NET.
      
      FIRST AND FORE MOST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I HAD BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART ON THE 8TH OF DEC. AND GOT IT IMMEDIATELY ON THE 10TH. SO GREAT JOB BY FLIPKART.
      
      I WOULD SAY THAT PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD PHONES WORTH MORE THAN 18K TO PLEASE NOT COMMENT HERE. NOT TO BE RUDE BUT, PHONES BELOW THAT PRICE RANGE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND CANNOT  BE COMPARED WITH HIGHER PRICED PHONES.
      
      MOVING ON TO THE PHONE.
      
      THE PHONE HAS A BRILLIANT DISPLAYING 4'' TOUCH SCREEN WHICH FEELS REALLY GOOD IN YOUR HAND AND LOOKS GOOD TO! ;-)
      
      THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SECOND THOUGHTS ON THE PHONE BECAUSE OF ITS SINGLE CORE BUT LET ME MAKE SOMETHING VERY CLEAR,
      
      HEAVY AND HD GAMERS OR THOSE WHO LOVE RUNNING A LOT OF APPS WHICH CONSUME LOT OF RAM TOO, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE. REASON BEING THAT IT HAS ONLY SINGLE CORE SO THERE WILL BE LAG.
      
      I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT I HAVE READ MANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE PHONE BEING LAGGY, WHICH IS NOT TRUE. SURE, IF YOU COMPARE IT TO A DUAL CORE YOUR NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS AS MUCH BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH THE LAG(WHICH IS THERE VERY RARELY) IS ALMOST NEGLIGIBLE.
      
      THE CAMERA IS QUITE GOOD FOR A 5MP ONE.
      
      THE NOTIFICATION LIGHT AT THE BOTTOM IS FUN LITTLE THING WHICH I REALLY LIKE.
      
      THE SPEAKERS ARE ALSO QUITE GOOD TOO!
      
      OVERALL I REALLY LOVE THE PHONE WHICH I AM CURRENTLY USING.
      
      AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD PHONES MORE THAN THIS ONE PLEASE DO NOT COMMENT.
      
      SO PLEASE MAKE A WISE CHOICE ON CHOOSING YOUR PHONE!
      
      I HOPE THIS ARTICLE IS HELPFUL! :D
      
      THANK YOU,
      
      I AM 15 YEARS BY THE WAY! :-P"
Xperia J,5,"I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH MY XPERIA J. THOSE ON THIS COMMENTS THREAD COMPLAINING ABOUT IT CLEARLY DO NOT POSSESS THE INTELLIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND IT'S FUNCTIONS ( AND I CAN TELL THIS BY THE POOR SPELLING AND TOTAL LACK OF PUNCTUATION IN YOUR COMMENTS LOL). I HAD A SONY ERICSSON XPERIA RAY UNTIL NOVEMBER (IT DIED ON MY BIRTHDAY:-( WHICH WAS NOT GOOD) AND BETWEEN THEN AND THE XPERIA J I'VE HAD A NOKIA LUMIA 610 WHICH IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST, MOST DEFICIENT AND ILL FUNCTIONING PHONE I HAVE EVER OWNED. I QUICKLY SOLD THAT ON AND BORROWED AN HTC WILDFIRE UNTIL I COULD FIND ANOTHER XPERIA RAY. BUT BEING NEARLY TWO YEARS OLD I COULDN'T FIND ONE. I LOVE SONY PHONES AND KNEW THAT ANOTHER ONE WAS ALL THAT WOULD SUFFICE. SURE IT HAS NO HD VIDEO ON THE J AND THE STILL CAMERA ISN'T AS GOOD AS THE RAY BUT BEING AS NOW IT'S GETTING HARDER TO FIND NEWER SMART PHONES WITH SD SUPPORT IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY XPERIA J, AND GIVEN TIME I'LL LOVE IT JUST LIKE I DID MY RAY. WHAT IT LACKS WHEN COMPARED TO MY SONY ERICSSON XPERIA RAY IT MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR WITH FUNCTIONS THAT WERE NOT ON THE XPERIA RAY. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO OTHER. ONLY ONE PROBLEM THEIR IS A CAMERA QUALITY IS A NOT GOOD."
Xperia J,5,I HAVE PURCHASED XPERIA J A MONTH AGO FROM LOCAL RETAILER. ON FLIPKART SITE IN ADDITIONAL FEATURES COLUMN IT SHOWS THAT THIS MODEL HAS 50 GB CLOUD SPACE AVAILABLE. PLEASE HELP ME ON HOW TO USE THIS CLOUD SPACE..
Xperia J,5,"I ORDERED THIS PHONE ON 06.03.2013 AT ABOUT 20.25 HOURS AND LO AND BEHOLD I RECEIVED THE SAME ON 09.03.2013, VERY NEATLY AND SAFELY PACKED WITH ALL ACCESSORIES IN TACT. I WAS INITIALLY APPREHENSIVE AS TO HOW THE PRODUCT WOULD BE, BUT I MUST ADMIT THE FLIPKART GUYS ARE PRETTY FAST - AND DO CARE A LOT FOR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. NOW, ABOUT THE PHONE - IT'S THE BEST IN ITS RANGE -
      
      1. 1 GH SINGLE CORE A5 PROCESSOR IS DAMN GOOD FOR SEVERAL APPLICATIONS (ALTHOUGH SOME WOULD LIKE TO PREFER A DUAL CORE ONE),
      
      2. 512 RAM IS OKAY FOR MOST APPLICATIONS, AND INTERNET BROWSING ALSO.
      
      3. 5 MP CAMERA CAN TAKE STUNNING PICTURES
      
      4. SOME 2.2 INTERNAL USER MEMORY IS ENOUGH TO STORE SEVERAL APPLICATIONS,
      
      5. ELSE, MICRO SD SUPPORT UPTO 32 GB IS AVAILABLE (I GOT A 16 GB MICRO SD CARD WITH THE     PHONE)
      
      6. THE 4"" CAPACITIVE TOUCH-SCREEN IS PRETTY GOOD (HAS SCRATCH RESISTANT GORILLA GLASS)
      
      7. COMES WITH MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE - DISPLAY 16 M COLOURS, AND GOOD PPI DENSITY WONDERFUL VIDEO PLAYS EVEN ON INTERNET,
      
      8. HAS WIFI HOT SPOT - I CHECKED THE INTERNET SPEED THROUGH WIFI BSNL BROAD-BAND, THE SPEED IS PRETTY GOOD.
      
      I KNOW THESE FEATURES ARE MENTIONED ON THE NET TOO, BUT I AM JUST MENTIONING WHAT I CHECKED WITHIN 4-5 HOURS AND FOUND THEM EFFICACIOUS.
      
      ON THE WHOLE A MARVELOUS PHONE! ANYONE CONTEMPLATING TO BUY XPERIA J, JUST GO AHEAD - IT LOOKS BETTER THAN MIRO AND TIPO, AND OTHERS IN ITS RANGE. I HAVEN'T COUNTERED ANY CONS IN THE PHONE YET...
      
      HATS OFF TO SONY!!! AND OF COURSE FLIPKART THANKS FOR THE GOOD SERVICE."
Xperia J,5,"IF YOU WANT A PHONE WITH A BIG SCREEN, ICONIC PLANO-CONCAVE DESIGN AND A MINDBLOWING BATTERY, XPERIA J IS THE PHONE FOR YOU. THE SMART ILLUMINATION ADDS TO THE CLASSY LOOK OF THIS BABY. IT MAY NOT BE AS POWERFUL AS XPERIA U COZ THIS ONLY HAVE A ARM CORTEX A5 SINGLE 1GHZ PROCESSOR AND AN ENHANCED ADRENO 200 GPU BUT NOT EVERYONE REQUIRES TO RUN HD VIDEO AND HI-DEF GAMES ON PHONES, 480P IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. THE SPEAKER IS SUPERB AS IT DOESN'T CRACKLE EVEN WHEN XLOUD IS TURNED ON. VIDEO PLAYBACK IS SUPERB PROVIDED THEY ARE OF 854X480 PIXELS. THERE IS NO AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR WHICH IS A BIT OF A BUMMER. THE LOCK BUTTON IS A BIT FLUSHED. IF YOU DON'T WANT A HIGH PERFORMANCE PHONE BUT A GOOD LOOKING PHONE, DEFINITELY GO FOR IT. THE DISPLAY IS CRISP WITH 245PPI ON A 4 INCH TFT GORILLA GLASS SCREEN. IF YOU WANT RAW POWER LIKE THOR, GO FOR XPERIA U. BUT IF YOU WANT STYLE AND PRODUCTIVITY, GO FOR XPERIA J. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY WITH MY DEVICE. THE WALKMAN IS SUPERB WITH MANUAL EQUALIZER AND THE FRONT FACING CAM COMES USEFUL AS WELL AT TIMES. OVERALL, THUMBS UP FROM ME AS IT CATERS TO ALL MY NEEDS."
Xperia J,5,"IT HAS A CURVED BACK WHICH MAKE IT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT ALSO HELPS TO HAVE GOOOD GRIP WHICH WE CAN'T FIND IN ANY MOBILE PHONE. IF U ARE THINKING TO BUY PHONE IN THIS RANGE PREFER SONY XPERIA J THAN HTC ONE V, DESIRE V. IT DOESN'T HAVE HD CAMERA AND DUAL CORE AND THESE TWO ARE ONLY IT'S DRAWBACKS. OTHERWISE ALL IT'S FEATURES ARE THE BEST AND CAN COMPETE WITH ANY MOBILE. [PLEASE PREFER SONY MOBILE THAN ANY OTHER]"
Xperia J,5,"ITS A GREAT PHONE TO HAVE AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER WITH THE COMPLIMENTARY SERVICE OF FLIPKART.
      
      THE QUICK RESPONSE OF FLIPKART WITH FAST ORDER PROCESSING AND QUICK DELIVERY IS THE PART WHICH ALL OTHER SITES LACK OFF."
Xperia J,5,"IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL PHONE. FOR A BEGINNER OF ANDROID IT'S BEST ONE STILL IN MARKET AT THIS PRICE AND LOOKS. LOOKS R GREAT (MUST HAVE TO MENTION). ONLY 9MM THIN SEEMS COOL TO HOLD THE PHONE AND EASY TO CARRY SUCH A SLIM PHONE. I HAVE BOUGHT IT A WEEK AGO. I HAVE NOT FACE ANY PROBLEM TILL NOW LIKE HANG, LAG TO MUCH, NETWORK PROBLEM OR ANY SENSOR PROBLEM (PROXIMITY SENSOR). UPDATE TO JELLY BEAN 4.1 IS AVAILABLE. AWESOME PHONE DON'T THINK TOO MUCH, JUST GO AND ORDER FOR PHONE......IT'S REALLY A VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT BY SONY."
Xperia J,5,"LET ME FIRST COMPLIMENT ON THE AWESOME DELIVERY SYSTEM OF FLIPKART. NEVER EVER DID I IMAGINE OF GETTING THIS MODEL IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS OF PLACING THE ORDER !!! AND THIS HAPPENED WHILE THE STOCK OF THIS PARTICULAR MODEL WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT ALMOST ALL OTHER LARGE FORMAT RETAILERS IN THE CITY. KUDOS TO FLIPKART FOR THAT !!!
      
      
      GREAT WORK BY SONY FOR BRINGING OUT THIS SUPER MODEL AT SUCH A COMPARITIVELY COMPETITIVE PRICE. AS FAR AS I HAVE COMPARED WITH OTHER MODELS OF SONY ITSELF, THE DESIGN FOR XPERIA J IS SIMPLY AWESOME: LIGHT WEIGHT AND SLEEK; GREAT LOOKS IT HAS INDEED!!
      
      
      THE DISPLAY IS ALSO BRILLIANT AND YOU WOULD BE TAKEN BACK BY THE CLARITY IT OFFERS ON HD VIDEOS.
      
      
      ONE OF THE VERY FEW DRAWBACKS I HAVE FACED AFTER USING THIS MODEL IS THAT A SLIGHT DRAG EXPERIENCED WHILE SWIPING OVER THE MENU ICONS.
      
      
      IN A NUTSHELL, THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT CHOICE IF YOU WOULD BE LOOKING OUT FROM A PLETHORA OF REQUIREMENTS IN ITS SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE USE. ENTERTAINMENT, BUSINESS FUNCTIONS, APPS FUNCTIONING, ALL WORKS OUT COMPLETELY FINE. THIS HAS NOT LET ME DOWN IN THESE AREAS WHILE I WAS OUT TRAVELLING, AND I STILL WAS ABLE TO BE IN SYNC WITH MY WORK."
Xperia J,5,"LETS START FROM FLIPKART. ONCE AGAIN QUICK AND RELIABLE DELIVERY. GOT MY PHONE DELIVERED WITHIN 3 DAYS OF ITS RELEASE IN FULLY PROTECTED PACKAGING.
      
      NOW THE PHONE. ONE WORD - WOW. THE XPERIA J IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE SMARTEST-LOOKING SMARTPHONES IN TOWN AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE PHONE ARE EXCELLENT AND THAT MAKES J A COMFY FIT IN THE PALMS WHILE USING IT. THE 5 MP CAMERA DOES GREAT JUSTICE COMPARING IT TO THE PRICE IT IS AVAILABLE AT. THOUGH THE VIDEO CAPTURING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN THE VGA RECORDING PROVIDED. THE 1GHZ PROCESSOR MAKES MULTITASKING EASY AN SLAG-FREE. MOST OF THE GAMES RUN PERFECTLY SMOOTHLY DESPITE THE SINGLE CORE. MUSIC IS HEAVENLY. THE WALKMAN APP INTEGRATION IS A THUMBS-UP TO SONY. IT DEFINITELY ENHANCES THE MUSIC LISTENING EXPERIENCE AND MAKES IT EASY FOR THE USER TO LISTEN TO ALL THEIR FAVORITE TRACKS IN A CONVENIENTLY SORTED WAY. THE LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT IS THE BEST PART OF THIS XPERIA. IT NOT ONLY HELPS IN ALERTING THE USER OF INCOMING CALLS, MESSAGES OR NOTIFICATIONS, BUT ALSO GIVES AN EDGE TO ITS APPEARANCE AND APPEAL AS A WHOLE.
      
      XPERIA J ON THE LONG RUN WOULD DEFINITELY BE A BUY FOR PEOPLE WITH 15K BUDGET AND HAVING ONE OF THESE IS A PLEASURE. I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE AS IT IS ALL I WANTED IN A PHONE.
      
      P.S. IT DEFINITELY WAS MADE TO MAKE PEOPLE JEALOUS OF YOU."

      IT'S HEADPHONE SOUND QUALITY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THOUGH."
Xperia J,5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ANDROID SMARTPHONES FROM SONY. IT HAS GOT MANY POSITIVE POINTS TO WANDER ABOUT HOWEVER ITS PROCESSING CAPACITY HAS NOT COME UP AS EXPECTED BUT IN TERMS OF LOOKS AND PERFORMANCE IT IS EXCELLENT.
Xperia J,5,"THIS PHONE HAS OUTDATED HARDWARE WHEN COMPARED TO XPERIA U/SOLA.
      
      
      WHEN COMPARED TO XPERIA SOLA.

      XPERIA J DOESN'T HAVE FLOATING TOUCH DISPLAY WHILE XPERIA SOLA HAS.BOTH DEVICES HAS MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE.
      
      
      XPERIA J HAS ICS OUT OF THE BOX PLANNED UPGRADE TO JB WHILE XPERIA SOLA HAS GINGERBREAD OUT OF THE BOX PLANNED UPGRADE TO ICS.HOWEVER SONY IS THINKING ABOUT JB UPDATE BUT NO OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION YET.
      
      
      BLUETOOTH VERSION IN XPERIA J IS 2.1 WHILE IN SOLA IT IS 3.0.
      
      
      XPERIA J HAS 1750MAH BATTERY WHILE SOLA HAS ONLY 1320MAH.

      WHEN COMPARED HARDWARE OF XPERIA J WITH XPERIA SOLA.XPERIA J IS WAY FAR BEHIND THAN XPERIA SOLA.
      
      
      THE DIFFERENCE I CAN SEE THAT XPERIA J HAS PLANNED UPGRADE TO JB(JELLY BEAN) BUT IN CASE OF SOLA SONY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.TILL NOW SOLA WILL NOT GET JB UPGRADE AS PER SONY'S PRESS RELEASE.BUT NEWS FROM INTERNAL SOURCES IS SAYING THAT SONY IS TAKING MEETINGS ON THIS ISSSUE. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHNG WHETHER SONY RELEASES JB UPDATE TO XPERIA SOLA OR NOT.
      
      
      AND SECONDLY, XPERIA J HAS FRONT FACING CAMERA.
      
      
      UM GONNA TO ASK THAT HOW MANY OF YOU DOES/MAKE VIDEO CALL???
      
      
      APART FROM THESE 2 DIFFERENCES XPERIA SOLA STANDS WINNER.
      
      
      REGARDING PRICE XPERIA SOLA IS LITTLE COSTLIER THAN J.BUT IT STAND FOR THE PRICE.XPERIA SOLA IS BEST AND GOOD ANDRIOD CELLPHONE UNDER 20K."
Xperia J,5,"THIS PHONE IS JUST AWESOME. GREAT FEATURES FOR AFFORDABLE PRICE. STYLISH TRENDY LOOK, GOOD BATTERY BACKUP, EXCELLENT VIDEO PLAYBACK AND XLOUD SOUND JUST ROCKS.. THE GORILLA GLASS IS AN ADDED ADVANTAGE. I RECOMMEND THIS PHONE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PHONES WITHIN THE RANGE INR 15,000 - INR 17,000"
Xperia J,5,"WHY THIS PHONE IS SUPERB
      
      1.DISPLAY:- NO OTHER PHONES WITH SAME RANGE HAVING THIS MUCH DISPLAY QUALITY.BRAVIA ENGINE IS SIMPLY AWESOME.
      
      2.PERFORMANCE:- ITS ONLY HAVE 512MB RAM BUT YOU WILL NOT FEEL THAT IS INSUFFICIENT.
      
      3.AUDIO:- AUDIO IS VERY QUALITY. BUT THE HEAD PHONE IS NOT SUITABLE TO REPRODUCE THAT HQ AUDIO. BETTER TO BUY A CREATIVE HEADPHONE FOR THIS DEVICE FOR FEEL THE REAL EFFECT.
      
      4.CAMERA:- I DONT KNOW WHATS THE REASON EVERYONE BLAME ABOUT THE CAMERA. ITS ABOVE AVERAGE IN QUALITY MUCH BETTER THAN OTHERS. VIDEO RECORDING ALSO GOOD........
      
      PROBLEMS
      
      1.IN SOME INSTANT PHONE LAGS A BIT....BUT IS VERY RARE
      
      CONCLUSION
      
      A VERY GOOD PRODUCT WITH 16K RANGE.....95/100.....
      
      REQUEST:-
      
      DON'T MAKE FAKE REVIEWS WITHOUT USING THE PRODUCTS....BECAUSE MANY PEOPLES CHOOSING PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART AFTER READING THE REVIEWS,SO THIS IS MY HUMBLE REQUEST DON'T MISSLEAD OTHERS."
Xperia J,5,"WITH A BUDGET OF AROUND 16K, THIS IS THE BEST ONE CAN GET.
      
      THE DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD, BATTERY ALSO EXCELLENT.
      
      MAY SHOW LAGS SOMETIMES BUT OVERALL A RICH EXPERIENCE.
      
      SUBWAY SURFER RUNS FINE.
      
      SOUND IS NICE BUT THE CAMERA COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

      THIS PHONE IS GOOD FOR THE FOLLOWING TAT I THINK,,

Xperia J,4,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE 2 DAYS BACK IN A LOCAL STORE! :)
      
      
      EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WORKING MORE THAN FINE, FOR ME TILL THIS SECOND :) DOWNLOADED ALMOST 10 APPS FROM THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE..!! SYNCING EVERYTHING WITH GOOGLE+ AND FACEBOOK, HAS MADE THE CONTACTS LOADING AND PHOTO SHARING EASIER :)
      
      
      THE TOUCH SCREEN WORKS AS SMOOTH AS SILK! :) THERE HAS BEEN NEVER A PROBLEM WITH THE TOUCH.
      
      
      THE CAMERA WORKS JUST FINE :) I DON'T WANT TO COMPARE IT WITH MY SONY CYBERSHOT, HOWEVER, THE PICS TAKEN BY THE 5.0 MP CAMERA ARE NOT BAD..!! :)
      
      
      THE SOUND LEVELS PLAYED BY THE MUSIC PLAYER ARE GOOD, BUT, THEY AIN'T AS LOUD AS THE OLDER WALKMAN PHONES OF SONY ERICCSON..!!
      
      
      HOWEVER, IF THERE ARE MORE THAN 3 PROGRAMS RUNNING, THE APPS SLOW DOWN A BIT..!! :)
      
      BUT, FOR A PHONE IN THIS RANGE, WE COULDN'T XPECT ANYTHING MORE :)"
Xperia J,4,"COMPARING THE CURRENT GENERATION OF XPERIA LINEUP, THIS DEVICE STANDS PRETTY LOW IN THE PERFORMANCE SEGMENT. DONT EXPECT A POWERHOUSE WITH 1 GHZ CORTEX A-5 AND ADRENO 200. FOR DECENT GAMING GO STRAIGHT AWAY TO U/SOLA/P.
      
      
      COMING TO XPERIA J, HAVING EXPERIENCED IT PERSONALLY AT STORES, I'L SURELY RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED EVERY BIT OF ANDROID EXPERIENCE TO MODERATE LEVELS. A SPACIOUS 4"" SCREEN, CURVY DESIGN, GREAT IMAGE AND AUDIO CLARITY, DUAL CAMERAS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH A CASUAL USER CAN EVER ASK FOR. EXPANDABLE STORAGE (32 GB) IS RARE ADD-ON COMING FROM SONY.

FONE RESOLUTION IS UP TO THE MARK MEANS VERY GUD, LUKS JUST THE PERFECT AS U CAN EXPECT THIS FROM SONY, SOUND AGAIN NO ONE CAN BEAT SONY, THEIR WALKMAN APP WILL KEEP UR MUSIC EXP STAND ALONE, SOMETIMES U CAN FIND SCREEN HICCUPS BUT NVR CREATED ANY PROBLEM, OK FOR ME, CAMERA IS AGAIN VERY GUD, COLOUR AND VISUALITY ARE SHARP COMPARED TO SAMSUNG FONE CAMERAS, SO IF U ARE LUKING FOR A STYLE STATEMENT WITHIN A RANGE OF 16K, I THINK NO OTHER FONE CAN REPLACE THIS, BEEN USING IT FOR 5 DAYS NOW, AND I M VERY MUCHH SATISFIED WITH THE XPERIENCE,"

      PROS ::
      
      1. GR8 LOOKS....I MEAN EVERY1 WILL ASK THE MODEL NAME WHEN UR HOLDING IT IN HAND... ;-)
      
      1. GOOD MUSIC QUALITY....

      3. BATTERY CHARGING DOES TAKE VERY LONG TIME...
      
      
      OVER ALL A GOOD PHONE IF U ARE A REGULAR USER &AMP; NOT A GAMER....I THINK IT IS PRICED LITTLE HIGHER....LOOKING TO ITS PERFORMANCE IT SHOULD BE PRICED AROUND 13K...ANDROID ICS IS VERY GOOD....SONY'S UI 'TIME SCAPE' IS ALSO GOOD....

Xperia J,4,"HEY FOLKS,
      
      
      I COME STRAIGHT TOT HE POINTS.
      
      
      POSITIVE PTS:
      
      
      CLARITY,SPEED(WITH NO OTHER OTHER INSTALLS),HANDY.EASY CHARGING BT,VERY SENSITIVE TO TOUCH.
      
      
      NEGATIVE:
      
      NO CAM BUTTON ON THE MOBILE, ITS DIFFICULT TO TAKE SNAP OF YOURSELF :),
      
      FOUND A DENT ON THE BT , BUT SINCE I AM ELECTRICAL GRADUATE I KNOW THAT IT WILL NOT MAKE HARM TO ME OR THE MOBILE.
      
      UNNECESSARY APPS ARE THER IN THE MOBILE.
      
      THEY DIDNT CALL ME BACK AFTER I RCV THE PRODUCT.
      
      NEED TO UPDATE THE PLAYER(AVI,MP4 IS NOT SUPPORTING) MV4IS SUPPORTNG
      
      
      CONCLUSION: DECENT PHONE TO CARRY.

Xperia J,4,"HEY FRIENDS I HAVE USED THIS PHONE FOR 3 MONTHS THEN I DROPPED IT IN WATER, NO COMPLAINTS LOL...
      
      
      ALTHOUGH I DIDNT BUY IT FROM HERE BUT I SHOULD WRITE A REVIEW ATLEAST TO HELP YOU ALL.
      
      
      CONFIGURATION: YOU ALL KNOW, 1GHZ PROCESSR, 512 RAM, 4GB INBUILT, USER AVAILABLE 1.9 GB.
      
      NOW WHAT I MUST SAY ABOUT IT IS THE CAMERA, I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH FANTASTIC CAMERA IN ANY OTHER PHONE (I USED SONY FOR FIRST TIME), I HAVE USED LUMIA, SAMSUNG AND MICROMAX BUT BELEIVE ME THE CAMERA IS AMAZING. IF YOU WISH TO HAVE VIDEOS SHOT FROM IT, I DONT THINK IT WILL GIVE YOU THAT MUCH QUALITY WHEN COMPARED TO NON HD SAMSUNG MOBILE. BUT PHOTOS ARE AMAZING FULL COLORS.
      
      THE SCREEN IS AMAZING IT HAS 266 PPI PIXEL DENSITY WHICH IS VERY GOOD INDEED, LOT BETTER THAN SAMSUNG GRAND OR S DUOS. PHONE IS LAGGY A BIT COZ OF LOWER PROCESSOR BUT U CAN KILL APPS FREQUENTLY TO KEEP YOUR RAM RUNNING AND HEALTHY.
      
      THE DESIGN IS SLEEK AND AWESOME,
      
      IT IS SLIPPERY SO U NEED TO HAVE A COVER FOR IT.
      
      TEMPLE RUN, GRANNY RUN WORKS FINE, SEE VIDEOS ON YOU TUBE BUT IT ISNT THAT SMOOTH. FRONT CAMERA IS AWESOME WHEN USED WITH SKYPE (SIM CALLING NA), BETTER THAN S DUOS.
      
      YOU SHOULD PREFER IT OVER OTHER PHONES LIKE S DUOS AND ALL, WHICH HAVE SAME CONFIGURATION.
      
      BUT SINCE I DROPPED IT IN WATER AND SHORT CIRCUITED THE MOTHERBOARD SO I AM NOT GOING TO BUY IT AGAIN, WELL I WAS PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT ALTHOUGH BUT I AM GOING FOR DUAL CORE PROCESSOR PHONE.
      
      ALSO NOT TO FORGET, THE PROCESSOR MAY BE PRESENT JUST BACK TO EAR PIECE SO THE PHONE BECOMES HOT AFTER TALKING A WHILE OR A BIT USING IT, YOU WILL FEEL THE WARMTH, BUT I SUPPOSE THAT IS WITH ALL SMARTPHONES.
      
      SRRY FOR MY SPELL MISTAKES :) BYEEE"
Xperia J,4,"I AM BEING USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST 3 MONTHS. THIS IS AN AVERAGE PHONE IN ACTUAL WORDS. THE MAIN REASON BEHIND IS THAT IT LAGS (AFTER SPENDING 13K TO 14K).
      
      
      THOUGH IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD BUT IT IS NOT CAPABLE FOR RUNNING 3 OR 4 APPS SIMULTANEOUSLY.
      
      GOOD:
      
      1. GOOD LOOKS. IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE TO CARRY.
      
      2. CAMERA IS SOOO GOOD. FRONT CAMERA IS ALSO GOOD(NOT BAD) IN DAYLIGHT.
      
      3. GREAT PICTURE QUALITY.
      
      4. GREAT BATTERY LIFE.
      
      5. ANDROID UPGRADED.
      
      
      BAD:
      
      1. IT LAGS ALOOT WHILE SWITCHING BETWEEN APPS OR EVEN SOME TIME IN OPENING JUST YOUR CONTACT LIST.
      
      2. WHEN CONNECTED WITH AUX WIRE. SPEAKERS WILL SOUND LOW ELSE INBUILD SPEAKERS ARE AVERAGE.
      
      
      AFTER ALL CONS I WILL SAY THAT I PERSONALLY LOVE THIS PHONE. BUT IF THERE IS SOME MORE RAM THEN IT WOULD BE GREAT. IF YOU ARE ABLE TO FIND A BETTER INSTALLED RAM THEN GO FOR IT OTHER WISE ITS ALSO A GOOD OPTION"
Xperia J,4,"I AM DELIGHTED TO OWN THIS BEAUTY, THE PHONE IS A STYLE STATEMENT OF SORTS WITH DUAL LED . ONE TINY ONE NEXT TO VGA (640X480) FRONT CAM AND OTHER ONE AT BASEL. YOU CAN EVEN CUSTOMIZE THE COLOR NOTIFICATION AS PER NEED. THEN NEXT THING IMPRESSING IS CURVY BACK AND IS ONLY 9MM THIN. CAME WITH ANDROID ICS WHICH I UPGRADED TO JELLYBEAN AFTER SONY RELEASED THE UPDATE VIA PC COMPANION (THERE IS AN ONBOARD APP TO DO IT WITHOUT PC AS WELL).
      
      
      AS FAR AS MY REQUIREMENTS ARE I USE WHATSAPP,FACEBOOK,SKYPE AND MUSIC PLAYER AND THE PHONE SATISFIED PRETTY MUCH OF MY NEEDS. HERE IS A SUMMARY OF WHATS GOOD, WHATS NOT AND WHAT WAS EXPECTED.
      
      
      WHATS GOOD-
      
      -BEAUTIFUL DESIGN, EYE CATCHING, LETS SAY J FOR JEALOUSY,LOVE THE DESIGN.
      
      - EXCELLENT CLARITY SCREEN, I COULD READ MINUTE CHARACTERS ON CHROME CLEARLY.
      
      -MUSIC PLAYER IS SUPERB, WITH PRESETS AND XLOUD FUNCTION,SHUFFLE,PARTY SHUFFLE MODES.
      
      -MULTI TASKING HANDLED WELL, AS AGAINST REVIEWS BY OTHERS, WITH 5-6 APPLICATIONS ARE HANDLED WELL, THOUGHT I CANT DENY SLIGHT NOTICEABLE LAG RIGHT FROM THE TIME I STARTED THE PHONE.
      
      -FRONT CAMERA HAS GOOD CLARITY. MADE SEVERAL VIDEO CALLS ON SKYPE AND EVERYONE SAID VIDEO WAS CRISP CLEAR, ITS VGA OR REALLY IS IT?
      
      -FLUID UI, JELLYBEAN IS A GOOD IMPROVEMENT OVER ICS, BATTERY REMAINING IS DISPLAYED IN PERCENTAGE AND DETAILED VIEWS OF SMS AND EMAILS STRAIGHT FROM DASHBOARD, NO FRILLS INTERFACE.
      
      
      WHATS NOT-
      
      -AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR ABSENT, FUNNY GIVEN I PAID PREMIUM FOR THIS CELL, THE ADVANTAGE OF SCREENS CLARITY IS NEARLY WIPED OFF WHEN IN SUNLIGHT.
      
      -MUSIC PLAYER SOMETIMES STUTTERS WHEN OTHER APPS ARE IN THE BACKGROUND.
      
      -CHEAP HEADSET PROVIDED IN THE BOX, HAS PLASTIC WRITTEN ALL OVER IT, I COULDNT USE MY IBALL HEADSET WITH IT DESPITE OF IT ALSO BEING 3.5MM
      
      
      WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER-
      
      -CAMERA, YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT ABOUT THE CAMERA NOT REALLY BEING ABLE TO FOCUS BEYOND A CERTAIN DISTANCE, THOUGH IT HAS OPTIONS LIKE METERING, WHITE BALANCE PRESETS,PANORAMA AND OPTION TO SWITCH TO FRONT CAM. FOR THOSE WANT LOW LIGHT SHOTS AND POSTCARD QUALITY PHOTOS, CONSIDER PURCHASING A DSLR, A TINY MOBILE CAMERA SENSOR CANT HANDLE LOW LIGHT UNLESS ITS WORTH A BOMB. I DON'T REALLY NEED IT AS I OWN A DSLR MYSELF.
      
      -JELLYBEAN THOUGH FLUID, ISN'T REALLY POWER EFFICIENT.
      
      
      MY VERDICT-
      
      OTHER THAN STYLING AND MODERATE PERFORMANCE, PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT MUCH FROM THIS PHONE. WHILE SPECS LOOK OK OK, IT DOES HAVE SOME GROUND TO COVER UP BEFORE IT BECOMES IDEAL PHONE. I DON'T REALLY SHOOT VIDEOS OR PLAY MUCH GAMES SO I WONT COMMENT ON ANYTHING I DON'T KNOW.
      
      
      PRICE DROPPED BY 1000 INR A WEEK I PURCHASED THIS PHONE, THOUGH IT DOESN'T MATTER AS IT CANT BE PREDICTED. THANKS TO GUYS AT FLIPKART FOR AWESOME EXPERIENCE AND RELIABILITY. I CHECKED OUT THIS CELL AT LOCAL SONY STORE WHICH OFFERED SAME PRICE BUT CHOSE FLIPKART.
      
      
      HOPE YOU FOUND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL :)"
Xperia J,4,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR 3 MONTHS NOW. ITS GREAT WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKS AND THE DISPLAY! MIND BLOWING. BUT IT USED TO LAG A LOT WHEN I HAD ICS AS MY OS. BUT 10 DAYS AGO I RECEIVED THE JELLY BEAN UPDATE AND IMMEDIATELY UPDATED MY PHONE. AFTER THAT MY PHONE RUNS SMOOOOOTH..... NO MORE LAGGING. I USE MY PHONE FOR MUSIC OF COURSE, A LOT OF TEXTING AND WATCHING TV SERIES. BUT I DONT PLAY GAMES ON MY MOBILE. THESE THINGS ARE SMOOTH. BUT THE BROWSING IS STILL A BIT LAGGY(USING CHROME BROWSER)."
Xperia J,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE COUPLE OF DAYS AGO .I GOT ICS 4.0.4 AND I UPDATED IT TO JELLY BEAN 4.1.2 .PHONE DESIGN IS AWESOME .ALSO JELLYBEAN RUNS SMOOTH .ANOTHER GORGEOUS PHONE FROM SONY .
      
      FLIPKART GIVES BEST PRICE 13800 RS .I HAVE SONY LIVE WITH WALKMAN ALREADY .SONY IS NICE BRAND .ONE CAN TRY HTC ALSO .HTC HAS LESS VARIETIES .I DONT LIKE SAMSUNG PERSONALLY .SONY HAS SUPERIOR BUILD QUALITY .JUST DONT WAIT , GO FOR IT !!!!!!!!! IN CASE OF ACCESSORIES FOR XPERIA J, GO FOR NCASE/AMZER PRODUCTS .RAINBOW COMPANY'S PRODUCT ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL."
Xperia J,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE JUST 3 DAYS BACK.AS OF NOW ITS IS VERY GOOD AND RUNNING SMOOTH.
      
      I AM NOT MUCH OF A GAMER,SO I HAVEN'T FOUND ANY GLITCH WHILE OPERATING IT.BATTERY LASTED FOR A DAY EVEN WHEN I HAD MUSIC ON.
      
      
      BEST FOR MUSIC LOVERS."
Xperia J,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON NOV 1ST.LET ME LIST OUT FEW THINGS HERE.FIRST OF ALL THE PHONE IS GOOD AND SUPER STYLISH UNDER 17K.
      
      PROS:
      
      1. EXCELLENT DESIGN AND STYLISH PHONE.LOVE THE SONY DESIGN
      
      2.MUSIC,CAMERA,BROWSING IS NICE
      
      3.NO FAULTS IN TOUCH AND PERFORMANCE IS GOOD.WORKS FINE WITH ALL BASIC NEEDS.
      
      4. RESOLUTION ,DISPLAY IS AMAZING
      
      5.ICS ANDROID IS COOL.
      
      6. VERY HANDY EASY TO CARRY ,LIGHT WEIGHT BECAUSE OF ITS SUPER SLIM CURVED DESIGN N SIZE.
      
      
      WHO SHOULD NOT BUY THIS PHONE:
      
      
      1. THE ONLY THING THAT DISAPPOINTS ME IS THE GAMING PART.IF U R LOOKING FOR A PHONE FOR GAMING DON'T GO FOR THIS. 512MB RAM AND SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR ISN'T SUFFICIENT. GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN RAN VERY SMOOTH INITIALLY BUT AFTER A MONTH IT STARTED LAGGING QUITE A LOT.:(
      
      FINALLY A GOOD PHONE :) BUT IF U WANT HIGH GRAPHIC GAMES GO FOR ANY DUAL CORE PROCESSOR PHONE.OTHERS CAN SURELY GO FOR XPERIA J(JEALOUS??)."
Xperia J,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE YESTRDAY. I LOVED THE WAY IT LOOKS. FEELS GR8 IN HAND AND CERTAINLY LOOKS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE 14K PRICE TAG. ILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH THE REVIEW , THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO HEAVY THINGS. EVEN IF U PUT A LIVE WALLPAPERS ON THE DEVICE, IT STARTS SKIPPING FRAMES OR I WOULD SAY IT STARTS LAGGING.SO WHEN THE LIVE WALLPAPERS KILL THE PHONE , I DIDNT EVEN TRY GAMING ON IT. BUT THE BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY NICE . WITH MODERATE USAGE IT DOES LAST MORE THAN A DAY. I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE THIS IS MY SECONDARY PHONE , ALL I NEED TO DO IS MAKE CALLS AND NOTHING ELS , FOR ALL THE OTHER HEAVY THINGS I HAVE NOTE 2. SO ONLY BUY IT IF U WANT A GOOD LOOKING PHONE AT THIS PRICE OR IF UR A MUSIC LISTNER OR IF U DONT WANT IT FOR HEAVY USAGE."
Xperia J,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FROM LAST 15 DAYS.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      AWESOME LOOKS.....NO OTHER PHONE IN THIS RANGE LOOKS THIS GREAT.
      
      4 INCH SCREEN WITH GOOD RESOLUTION.
      
      5 MP CAMERA WORKS NICELY AS EXPECTED FROM SONY
      
      MUSIC OUTPUT IS GOOD AS WELL
      
      PLAYED GAMES LIKE TEMPLERUN, ANGRYBIRDS, RAILRUSH, WORLD AT ARMS WITHOUT ANY ISSUES....
      
      BATTERY LIFE IS VERY GOOD COMPARED TO OTHER SONY PHONES LIKE XPERIA U
      
      COMES DEFAULT WITH ANDROID 4 ICS
      
      SECONDARY CAMERA GOOD FOR VIDEO CALL
      
      
      CONS:
      
      PROCESSOR IS PRETTY OLD AND NOT DUAL CORE
      
      RAM IS ONLY 512 MB
      
      NOT ABLE TO PLAY GAMES WITH HIGH 3D GRAPHICS
      
      
      IF YOU ARE NOT TOO MUCH INTO HIGH 3D GRAPHICS GAMES THAN THIS IS THE BEST PHONE."
Xperia J,4,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE AROUND 6TH NOV AND HAVE BEEN USING IT DAILY FOR GAMES, VIDEOS, INTERNET AND READING AND HERE IS MY FEEDBACK.
      
      1.) TEMPLE RUN LOADS SLOW AND LAGS FOR FEW SECONDS AT BEGINNING N IN MIDDLE.
      
      2.) CUT THE ROPE LOADS VERY SLOWLY
      
      3.) TEMPLE RUN BRAVE HANGS A LOT. HAVEN'T CHECKED HD GAMES YET.
      
      4.) INTERNET IS OK .(I'M USING 2G DOCOMO)
      
      5.) VLC IS WORST, INBUILT PLAYER CAN'T PLAY FEW LARGE SIZE MOVIES. MX PLAYER IS GOOD BUT COULDN'T PLAY 1080P MOVIES N VIDEOS.
      
      5.) READING I USED ADOBE N OFFICE SUIT N THEY ARE OK.
      
      6.) MUSIC IS GOOD.
      
      7.) LAGS AT TIME., SCREEN BECOME UNRESPONSIVE AT TIMES.
      
      8.) STORAGE- INTERNAL - 2 GB AND PHONE - 754 MB.
      
      P.S: IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER MODEL IN MIND YOU CAN GO FOR IT. I FEEL THIS XPERIA J  IS BIT OVERPRICED FOR IT'S PERFORMANCE AND SPECS"
Xperia J,4,"I HAVE BROUGHT SONY XPERIA LAST WEEK...
      
      GOOD PHONE EXCEPT THE CAMERA...
      
      
      CAMERA IS WORST PART OF THE PHONE... DAYLIGHT PICS ARE OK ( LIKE A 3MP) ... NIGHT PICS ARE WORST ( LIKE A VGA CAMERA) TRIED IN NIGHT MODE ALSO.... CAMERA FLASH IS ALSO NOT THAT GOOD... I AM NOT SURE IF WE NEED TO CHANGE ANY SETTINGS.. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA...
      
      
      TEMPLE RUN HANGS FOR A FRACTION OF SECOND SOMETIMES AT THE START OF THE GAME.. BUT LATER ON IT WORKS FINE... BUT OTHER GAMES LIKE STICK CRICKET/SUBWAY SURF WORKS FINE..."
Xperia J,4,"I HAVE RECEIVED JUST YESTERDAY, AND I HAVE CONTINUOUSLY USED IT FOR 6 TO 7 HOURS STILL THE BATTERY WAS THERE. SO IT IS WITH GOOD BATTERY BACKUP AND SOUND QUALITY IS UP TO THE MARK.
      
      PROS:
      
      1. DISPLAY
      
      2. SOUND
      
      3. SCREEN SIZE
      
      4. FACEBOOK INTEGRATION
      
      5. BATTERY
      
      6. CAMERA
      
      CONS:
      
      1.BACK COVER IS VERY LIGHT MADE FROM PLASTIC WHICH RUINS THE OVERALL IMAGE OF THE PHONE
      
      2.THERE IS NO SHORTCUTS FOR POWER CONTROL/WIFI/BT IN THE NOTIFICATION AREA.
      
      3.SOUND OUTPUT IS SLOWER ON EXTERNAL SPEAKER ATTACHED (I TRIED IT ON MY IBALL 5.1 CHANNEL SYSTEM)."
Xperia J,4,"I I HAVE BEEN PLANNING TO BUY A SMART PHONE FOR A LONG TIME AND MY IDEAL PHONE WAS SAMSUNG GALAXY SII BUT DUE ITS HIGH COST ITS OUT OF MY BUDGET, BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A PHONE WITH ALMOST SAME FEATURES BUT WITHIN 15K, THAT IS RUBBISH ITS NOT POSSIBLE....
      
      AFTER A LOT OF RESEARCH READING ABOUT ALL THE ASPECTS, HARDWARE CONFIGURATION, ANDROID OS VERSION, GPU EFFECTS, SCREEN SIZE, CAMERA CONFIGURATION. I WONDERED WHY THERE CANT BE A SINGLE SET FROM EVERY MANUFACTURE WHICH COULD SATISFY EVERY MENTIONED QUALITY TO BE PRESENT IN THAT SET AND THAT SHOULD BE THE ULTIMATE IN ITS SEGMENT, THEN I WONDERED IF THAT SET IS LAUNCHED IN THE MARKET WITHIN A RANGE OF 20K THEN EVERY OTHER SET WILL NOT BE SOLD.
      
      
      SO 1ST THING PRIORITIZE WHAT YOU WANT FROM YOUR PHONE AND BELIEVE ME IF YOU WANT IT WITHIN YOUR BUDGET YOU WOULD HAVE TO SACRIFICE/COMPROMISE WITH SOME LESS GRADED OTHER FEATURES.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. SCREEN SIZE 4"", LOOKS GOOD IN HAND.
      
      2. OS ANDROID V4 (ICE CREAM SANDWICH) MOST PROBABLY UP-GRADABLE TO ANDROID V4 (JELLY BEANS)[BUTTER PROJECT OF GOOGLE, TO IMPROVE THE GRAPHICS, INCLUDE GOOGLE VOICE SEARCH, GOOGLE MAPS OF CITIES CAN BE DOWNLOADED, UNLOCK SCREEN WILL BE CHANGED ETC]
      
      3. PROCESSOR IS FINE AND SO IS THE USER INTERFACE(TIMESCAPE)
      
      4. SCRATCH RESISTANT SCREEN AND SONY BRAVIA ENGINE.
      
      5. WITHIN RANGE UNDER 16500RS
      
      6. CAMERA FOR STILL PHOTOGRAPHS IS GOOD, WITH LED FLASH
      
      7. SECONDARY CAMERA(VGA) FOR VIDEO CALL OVER VOIP, INTERNET.
      
      8. BATTERY IS 1700MAH... PROVIDES BETTER BATTERY BACKUP."
Xperia J,4,"I SOLD SAMSUNG S DUOS AT A LOSS AND BOUGHT THIS SONY XPERIA J AND GUYS THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PHONE. IT HAS KILLER LOOKS,  MOST BEST AND AMAZING SOUND QUALITY, JUST LIKE THETRE SOUND IN THE CALLS AND MUSIC AND PICTURE QUALITY IS THE BEST ITS A SONY AFTER ALL.
      
      BATTERY IS HUGE
      
      SPEED OF PROCESSOR BEST NO ISSUE TEMPLE RUNS RUNS SOOMTLY LIKE MAKHAN
      
      UI  IS GOOD
      
      LIGHTS BLINK WHEN U MISS A CALL OR SMS THEY CHANGE COLORS IT IS FUN
      
      ITS A DREAM COME TRU
      
      KEYBOARD IS SURPRISING RESPONSIVE AND I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THE PHOTOS I CLICKED WERE
      
      MIND BLOWING WHAT ELSE DO U WANT FROM THE PHONE GUYS GO FOR IT
      
      CONS:- BIT GETS WARMER NEAR EAR IF U TALK FOR HALF AND HOUR CONTINUOS
      
      BUT REST IS OK AND IT SUBSIDES SOON, SO NO ISSUES"
Xperia J,4,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A SMART PHONE WITH TOUCH-SCREEN AND A 4-INCH SCREEN, BUT ONE THAT WOULD NOT BUST THE BANK. THE SONY EXPERIA MET THE PARAMETERS.
      
      
      WITH AN EASY CUSTOMER INTERFACE, THIS IS A VERSATILE PHONE, SET UP FOR SOCIAL NETWORKS AS WELL AS STANDARD WORKING TOOLS. THE  SCREEN RESOLUTION AND BRIGHTNESS ARE EXCELLENT.
      
      .
      
      THE BATTERY LIFE IS A LITTLE LOW, AND FOR HEAVY USERS THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM."
Xperia J,4,"I WAS LOOKING TO PURCHASE A GOOD PHONE AS GIFT FOR MY SISTER. I SQUARED DOWN ON THIS PHONE FOR ITS PRICE AND THE FEATURES IT HAD. MOST OF US ARE KEEN ON FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP, VIBER ETC. SO A GOOD ANDROID PHONE DOES THE TRICK.
      
      
      I CHOSE FLIPKART AS IT OFFERED ME A BETTER PRICE THAT THE LOCAL RETAILERS ALONG WITH 16GB MEMORY CARD. HENCE, I PLACED AN ORDER FOR THIS PHONE. IT REACHED ME IN TEN DAYS TIME AND I FELT THE PACKAGING OF THE PHONE COULD HAVE A LITTLE BETTER, AS IT CARRIED A EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT
      
      TALKING,ABOUT THE PHONE'S PERFORMANCE, ITS GOT GOOD SPEED,CAMERA CLARITY CAN BE BETTER, RESPONSE TIME IS GOOD, THE SPEAKERS ARE PRETTY GOOD, THE PHONE'S TOUCH MECHANISM  IS NICE AND EASY ON HANDS. THE PHONE LOOKS GOOD AND FITS WELL IN YOUR HAND.
      
      
      OVERALL, ITS A GOOD PHONE WITHIN THE BUDGET OF 15K. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO A FRIEND.
      
      
      FLIPKART DID FINE JOB WITH THIS, I AM SURE I LL BUY MORE STUFF FROM YOU ;)"
Xperia J,4,"IF ANYONE PLANNING TO BUY A USEFULL SMART ANDROID PHONE WITHIN 20000 RUPEES BUDGET,THEY CAN GO FOR SONY EXPERIA J WITHOUT ANY DOUBT.
      
      LOOKS AND GET UP IS FINE
      
      BATTERY BACKUP,WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER ANDROID PHONE IS GOOD
      
      AWESOME DISPLAY QUALITY WITH AMAZING BRIGHTNESS,EVEN IF SOMEONE MAKES THE BRIGHTNESS LEVEL ""ZERO"" THEN ALSO IT WILL LOOK BRIGHT ENOUGH!!!
      
      CAMERA QUALITY FOR STILL PHOTOGRAPHY IS WELL ENOUGH
      
      INTERNET BROWSING IS FAST COMPARED TO OTHERS.
      
      TOUCH IS AMAZING
      
      I AM USING IT SINCE JANUARY THIS YEAR AND NEVER FACED ANY MAJOR ISSUE.SOMETIMES THE PHONE GETS HANG OR SOME APPLICATION STOPS AUTOMATICALLY(ALL THIS MAY HAPPEN WITH ME ONLY AS I AM USING ONLY IT'S INTERNAL STORAGE,EXPANDABLE SD CARD MAY SOLVE IT)  THAT'S TRUE BUT BELIEVE IT HAPPENS FOR ALL SMART PHONE.
      
      BUT IF YOU WANT CASES AND COVERS FOR THIS PHONE IT IS TOUGH AS THERE IS NO FLIP COVER AVAILABLE FOR IT AND SOUND QUALITY IS NICE BUT NOT EXTRAORDINARY AS WE GENERALLY EXPECT FROM SONY"
Xperia J,4,"IF YOU WANT YOUR PHONE TO LOOK BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE GO FOR IT..
      
      IT LOOKS AWESOME... THOUGH AM NOT HARD USER OF MOBILE, PERFORMANCE SO FAR LOOKED REALLY GOOD DOES'T HANG.. INSTALL MORE THAN 30 APPS.. CAMARA IS NOT UP TO SONY STANDARD IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.. MUSIC CANT HAVE BETTER PHONE THAN SONY WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC..
      
      TOUCH IS GOOD.. BATTERY I DON'T KNOW.. ALL SMART PHONE MIGHT COME ONLY 1 DAY.."
Xperia J,4,"IN SCREEN QUALITY AND SCREEN SIZE THIS ONE IS SURELY A BEST BUY. GOOD CLARITY IN DISPLAY, LIKE HD...!
      
      BUT THE CAMERA, SONY IS GIVING 5MP CAMERA, BUT THE LENS IS NOT GIVING A GOOD QAULITY PICTURE OUT. SO POOR CAMERA...!
      
      MUSIC, GIVING GOOD OUTPUT, BUT THE EARPHONE STOCK, IS NOT IN EAR, AND IT GIVES A LOW VOLUME OUTPUT. ALSO WE CANNOT CONNECT THIS FONE AS AUXILLARY IN TO ANY SYSTEM, THE SOUND OUT IS VERY LESS.
      
      OTHERWISE THE FONE IS GOOD...!
      
      MY OPINION, IF U R LOOKING FOR CAMERA, DON GO FOR THIS FONE. ALSO, TO ENJOY THE MUSIC, BETTER BUY A GOOD IN EAR EARFONE.
      
      FOR ME ITS GOOD...!"
Xperia J,4,"ITS SAD THAT MANY POTENTIAL BUYERS ARE PUT OFF FROM BUYING THIS PHONE AFTER READING REVIEWS FROM POPIULAR PHONE REVIEW SITES. THE THING IS, THESE SITES CONSIDER DOWNRIGHT PERFORMANCE AND CAMERA QUALITY AS TWO DECIDING FEATURES AMONGST MANY OTHERS, WHICH IS WHERE, UNFORTUNATELY, THIS PHONE FALLS SHORT. GAMERS AND MULTITASKERS WILL HATE THIS PHONE..BUT AUDIOPHILES LIKE ME, AND PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT A FANTASTIC MULTIMEDIA EXPERIENCE ABOVE ALL OTHER FACTORS WILL CONSIDER THIS PHONE AS A REALLY GOOD BARGAIN. AUDIO IS CLEAR AND WELL BALANCED AND YOU CAN TWEAK EQUALISERS AT WILL. VIDEO PLAYBACK IS AWESOME THANKS TO A NEAT VIDEO ENGINE AND ALTHOUGH YOU CANT PLAY ALL CODECS, A STOCK VIDEO PLAYER DOES THE TRICK HERE(I USE MOBO PLAYER, ITS PRETTY NEAT)
      
      THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THE DEVICE PERFORMANCE IS NOT THE PROCESSOR..FOR HEAVENS SAKE ITS THE SAME ONE THAT POWERS THE HTC ONE V...ITS THE DAMN INTERFACE.. TIMESCAPE, SONY'S UI IS PRETTY HEAVY, CHECK OUT THE ANIMATIONS AND VISUALISATIONS AND UL KNO WHAT I MEAN..WHEN COMPARED TO SOMETHING LIKE SENSE. DONT GET ME WRONG..TIMESCAPE LOOKS COOL AND ITS GREAT FOR SOCIAL NETWORKING, BUT IF U WANT A FASTER XPERIA J..ID REALLY ADVISE A CUSTOM ROM..
      
      BOTTOM LINE..IF UR A GAMER OR A MULTITASKER..SORRY BRO BUT UR BETTER OFF LUKING ELSEWHERE.
      
      BUT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S JUST UPGRADED TO ANDROID LIKE ME AND WANTS A SMOOTH AND AWESOME ANDROID EXPERIENCE ON A SHARP SCREEN WITH AWESOME VISUALS, THE XPERIA J IS THE WAY TO GO!"
Xperia J,4,"I'VE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE 3 MONTHS NOW.ALTHOUGH I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WH FLIPKART IS NOT DROPPING IT'S PRICE BECAUSE ONE CAN BUY THIS PHONE FOR AROUND RS 13000.EVEN I GOT IT FOR 13K.
      
      SO,ABOUT THE PHONE...
      
      PROS-
      
      1.CAMERA QUALITY IS WAY BETTER THAN GALAXY S DUOS.
      
      2.NICE DESIGN.
      
      3.GOOD TOUCH.
      
      4.HAVE BRAVIA ENGINE(SONY EMBEDS THESE CHIPS IN THEIR TV'S).
      
      5.HAVE GORILLA GLASS.
      
      6.BATTERY BACKUP IS PRETTY MUCH BETTER THAN MANY PHONES IN IT'S CLASS.
      
      7.UPGRADABLE TO ANDROID V4.1.2 JELLY BEAN.(NOT SURE IF SONY WILL GIVE IT A V4.2.2 UPGRADE)
      
      8.FAIRLY DECENT RESOLUTION OF 480X854 PX AND 16M COLORS WHICH REALLY GIVES A GOOD AND CRISP DISPLAY QUALITY.
      
      9.XLOUD AUDIO FILTER FOR AUDIO.(SONY PHONES ARE BEST IN TERMS OF MUSIC)
      
      10.WALKMAN APP PREINSTALLED IN THE DEVICE AS THE DEFAULT MUSIC PLAYER.
      
      11.I WAS ABLE TO PLAY GAMES LIKE NFS MOST WANTED 2012,DEAD SPACE,TEMPLE RUN 2,THE DARK KNIGHT,ASPHALT 7:HEAT EASILY,AND LET ME REMIND YOU ALL THAT THESE ARE THE MOST GRAPHIC INTENSIVE GAMES FOR ANDROID.BUT NO LAGGING AT ALL.
      
      12.CURVED BACK GIVES THIS PHONE A REALLY COOL LOOK.
      
      13.FRONT CAM IS WAY BETTER.
      
      14.GOOD AT MULTITASKING.
      
      15.I HAVE LIKE 37 APPS IN MY PHONE AND STILL THE PHONE IS RUNNING SMOOTHLY.
      
      
      CONS-
      
      1.GPU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER BECAUSE ADRENO 200 IS WAY TOO OLD.
      
      2.CPU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ATLEAST DUAL CORE.ALTHOUGH NO PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU CAN ROOT IT WHENEVER YOU WANT TO AND OVERCLOCK IT.EVEN XPERIA U HAVE A DUAL CARE AND IT'S WAY MORE CHEAPER THAN XPERIA J. :)
      
      3.CAMERA FLASH ISN'T THAT GOOD.IT LOOKS AS IF I WAS CLICKING PICS WITH WHITE GHOSTS.
      
      4.RAM SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE LIKE 768MB OR MAY BE 1GB.
      
      5.VIDEO REC. IS AT 480P WHICH IS NOT A BIG CON BECAUSE ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY RECORD VIDEOS VIA PHONE.
      
      
      BENCHMARKS(ALL BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN RUN ON ANDROID V4.1.2 AND ON LATEST AVAILABLE BENCHMARKING TOOLS)-
      
      1.NENAMARK 2 - 20.3 FPS(REALLY LOW FOR SUCH A HIGH END DEVICE)
      
      2.ANTUTU BENCHMARK - 4610
      
      3.QUADRANT BENCHMARK - 2396
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT-BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR STYLE AND HAVE A RESTRICTED BUDGET OF 12-13K.IF YOU WANNA GO FOR PERFORMANCE THEN GO FOR XPERIA U (YOU'LL NOT BE ABLE TO EXPAND YOUR MEMORY VIA MICROSD CARD AND YOU WILL NOT GET A FRONT CAM ON XPERIA U).
      
      OR
      
      BETTER THAN BOTH OF THEM BUT A BIT COSTLY.IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS STYLE THEN GO FOR XPERIA L(IT COSTS AROUND RS16000)."
Xperia J,4,"JUST POSTING THIS IN ADDITION TO MR GHOSH'S VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND USEFUL REVIEW.
      
      THE PHONE DEFINITELY ATTRACTS YOU WITH ITS LOOKS AND TRUST ME FOR THE MONEY U SPEND ON IT, IT IS WORTH IT. THAT CNET AND PHONEARENA RATING CAN BE SIMPLY IGNORED AS IT IS NOT THAT BAD, TRUST ME! (GOOD POINT MADE IN THE LAST REVIEW BY MR GHOSH AS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING AWAY FROM THIS HANDSET COZ OF THAT NEGATIVE REVIEW,WHICH INCLUDED ME.) I WUD SAY GAMERS TO AVOID THIS PHONE BUT A MODERATE USER LIKE ME WHO USES SMARTPHONE BASICALLY TO CALL, LISTEN TO MUSIC, TAKE SOME PICS AND TO CONNECT SOCIALLY, THIS IS THE PHONE FOR A MOUTH WATERING PRICE AT AROUND 16K.
      
      IF U REALLY WANT PERFORMANCE AND JUST PERFORMANCE THEN KINDLY FIRST SHELL OUT MORE MONEY FROM YOUR POCKETS AS U WON'T GET EVERYTHING IN ONE PHONE AND THAT TOO AT THIS PRICE.
      
      AS FOR THE PERFORMANCE (IT'S MOST NEGATIVE POINT AS PER CRITICS), ITS DECENT AND NOT LAGGING (U WON'T FIND A DIFFERENCE FROM A DUAL CORE IN NORMAL ACTIVITIES THAT MUCH, IT'S ONLY WHEN U PLAY GAMES OR SURF ON VERY BIG PAGES OR USE VERY LARGE APPS, THAT IT SLOWS DOWN)...
      
      CAMERA, AS MENTIONED IN THE REVIEWS(NOT THAT GOOD), IS DEFINITELY A DECENT CAMERA, NOT BAD AT ALL AND WILL SERVE U WELL IN GOOD LIGHT AREAS.
      
      VIDEOS DEFINITELY LAG BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE A CONCERN AS THE ONES RECORDED FROM THE PHONE WORK PRETTY DECENT.
      
      DISPLAY IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING EVEN AT TIGHT ANGLES.
      
      
      GOOD PHONE AND YES, APART FROM 4'' DISPLAY AND SEXY SLIM LOOKS, THIS ONE CAN ALSO BE MARKETED FOR IT'S BATTERY, WHICH IS JUST SUPERB, SO FAR NOT MATCHED BY ANY OF IT'S PREDECESSORS IN THIS RANGE IN ANY OF THE BRANDS.
      
      I WOULD SAY, THUMBS UP AND MY RATING 4/5 IS ONLY COZ 5/5 IS FOR AN ALMOST PERFECT PHONE."
Xperia J,4,"LET ME START WITH THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE:
      
      *THE SPEAKERS!
      
      *THE TOUCH!
      
      
      BUT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM A SONY XPERIA PHONE IS GOOD HEADPHONES TOO!
      
      SO, IF YOU THINK FOR 16K YOU'RE GETTING THIS AWESOME PHONE, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SPEND AN EXTRA GRAND OR TWO FOR HEADPHONES, BECAUSE THE HEADPHONES WHICH COMES WITH THIS PHONE IS USELESS.
      
      
      I WAS USING A BLACKBERRY BOLD EARLIER, COMPARED TO THAT THE MUSIC PLAYER SUCKS. THE PHONE DOESN'T SAVE YOUR PREFFERED SETTINGS, AND EVERY TIME YOU PLAY A SONG BY GOING TO THE MUSIC LIBRARY, IT PUTS THAT VERY SONG ON THE LOOP, WHICH IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING.
      
      
      IF YOU WISH TO PLAY GAMES, SUCH AS SUBWAY SURFERS OR TEMPLE RUN, THIS IS NOT A PHONE FOR YOU, THE GAME WILL LAG. GO FOR A PHONE WITH AT LEAST 1GB RAM, THIS PHONE COMES WITH ONLY 512.
      
      
      THE BACK OF THE PHONE IS PROBABLY SCRATCH LESS AND IS BUILT VERY STURDY. YOU WILL HOPEFULLY NOT REQUIRE A BACK COVER OR ANYTHING.
      
      
      THE BATTERY IS PRETTY DECENT, OVERALL NOT VALUE FOR MONEY, BUT IT IS OKAY.
      
      
      SO BASICALLY, ONLY BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU ARE NOT FOND OF DOWNLOADING APPS, PLAYING GAMES.
      
      BUT FOR BASIC PURPOSE SUCH AS CLICKING PHOTOS, MAKING CALLS, TEXTING, WHATSAPP. THIS PHONE IS GOOD. :)"
Xperia J,4,"M USING  THIS PHN FOR ABOUT MORE THAN A WEEK AND I WILL SAY, AS IN REVIEWS ON THE NET , IT DOES NOT HANG A LOT..SOMETIMES A MINOR LAG IS SEEN IN UI BT THATS ACCEPTABLE NOT A DEAL BROKER.THE PHONE IS ELEGANT IN LOOKS AND EASILY HANDLE OCCASIONAL GAMING LIKE TEMPLE RUN ,TURBO FLY 3D ETC QUITE EASILY. ITS DEFINATLY  NOT MEANT FOR HD GAMES AND HARD GAMERS BECAUSE OF A SINGLE CORE 512 .THE PROCESSING SPEED IS FINE NOT AS LOW AS IN REVIEWS OVER THE NET ..THOUGH BUYING A DUAL CORE COULD SAVE YOU  AN EXTRA SECOND OR 2  IF THE WORLD WAS AT AN END (PUN INTENDED)
      
      ONE LINE--FOR A CASUAL AND NOT SO GEEKY USER ,THE PHONE IS SIMPLY AWESOME AT THIS PRICE.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1 BEST- GREAT IN DESIGN OVERPOWERING THE REST IN SEGMENT(LOOKS LIKE A 22K PHN)
      
      2 ILLUMINATION SYSTEM IS AWESOME (WORKS BETTER AFTER INSTALLING SOME TWEAKS)
      
      3 A GOOD WALKMAN BRANDED MUSIC PLAYER IN STOCK.(SONY BEST IN CLASS SOUND QUALITY)
      
      24 DECENT BATTERY 1700MAH (NO CHARGER IN POCKET ISSUE)
      
      5 ICS 4.0.4 OUT OF THE BOX(UPGRADEBLE TO JELLY BEAN)
      
      6 BIG 4"" GORILLA GLASS DISPLAY WITH 245PPI PRODUCES CRISP VIBRANT AND EYE PLEASING DISPLAY QUALITY ( WATCHNG VIDEOS AND PHOTOS IS REALLY REALLY AMAZING)
      
      7 SONYS UI IS NEAT AND PLEASING TO EYES WITH GREAT EASE OF USE AND SOPHSTCATN
      
      8 GOT IT FOR JUST 14.8K
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      WELL CONS , YES THIS PHONE DOES HAS SOME..YOU WOULD FIND THEM EASILY AND EARLY AFTER PURCHASING
      
      
      1 THE RAM IS JUST 512 MB..INSTALLING MORE THAN 25-30 APPS  AND IT STARTS FUMBLING ,EASILY NOTICABLE IN UI UNTIL YOU FREE SOME RAM , IT CUD EASILY BE 768MB WITHOUT MUCH ADDITIONAL COSTS .RESTARTNG THE PHN WOULD SOLVE THE PROB  (I DINT NEED TO DO THAT TILL NOW)
      
      2 A SLIGHT ECHO PROBLEM IS NOTICED WHILE ON CAL SOMETIMES (DONT COVER  THE PHN NEAR THE CAMERA REGION (I DNT KNY WHY) ON CALLS AND YOU AVOID THAT )
      
      3 THE SOUND IN EARPIECE IS GOOD FOR INDOOR ,SEMI-INDOOR CONDITIONS BT FOR NOISY CONDITIONS (EX. TRAFFIC OR LARGE CROWD) THE IN EAR VOLUME IS VERY LOW FOR HEARING ,THIS WASNT EXPECTED FRM SONY.
      
      4 THE CAMERA..AT LAST  , ITS GOOD ONLY IF YOU CLICK PICTURES UP CLOSE (MAX3-4 M )AFTER THAT, THE PIXELS CN BE SEEN IF ON COMPUTER, AT NITE , THE CAMERA QUALITY ISNT UPTO THE MARK.
      
      5 THE MESSAGING .. IN FULLSCREEN LANDSCAPE MODE THE QWERTY KEYBOARD WOKS GUD , BT IN PORTRAIT MODE OWING TO A LIL NARROW SCREEN , THERE ARE SOME TYPING ERRORS, WHILE IF ON THE PHONEPAD MODE ,IT LAGS A LIL SOMETIMES IF TYPING VERY FAST
      
      5 VIDEO CALLING ON SKYPE IS GOOD,2G IS SUPPORTD BT HVNT USED  BT NO VIDEO CALLING ON 3G SUPPORTED( BEFORE CONSIDERING THIS, JUST THINK HOW OFTEN OR WITH WHOM WUD YOU USE VIDEO CALLING AND KEEPING THE DATA CHARGES IN MIND :) )
      
      
      FOR THOSE CONFUSED B/W J AND S DUOS
      
      
      50% MORE RAM  BT STILL IT ALSO LAGS
      
      AND FOR THE NOTIFICATION  BAR AND THE BUILT IN TASK MANAGER IN S DUOS, YOU CAN GET IT ALL FROM ANDROID STORE TRUST ME I HAVE IT AND ITS WAY BETTER ..SAMSUNG DISSAPOINTS WITH ITS SAME DESIGN FOR EVERY PHONE BE IT A 3K,7K OR 11K OR 15K PHONE.THE CAMERA IS BETTER THAN J AND PRODUCES BETTER IMAGES BT FOR THOSE WHO REQUIRE DUAL SIM FUNCTIONALITY THE PHONE IS BEST IN SEGMENT ,GO FOR IT.
      
      
      FOR THOSE CONFUSED B/W J ND DESIRE ONE V-
      
      
      J HAS A LARGER DISPLAY, BETTER LOOKS , SAME CONFIG 1GHZ 512MB ,BETTER BATTRY BACKUP AND A BETTER UI ,
      
      FOR HD RECORDING IN ONE V , NONE BEATS MY DIGI CAM :)
      
      
      FOR CONFUSED B/W J AND SOLA-
      
      
      GUYS NO COMPARSON ,SOLA WINS HANDS DOWN ANYDAY ANYTIME  WITH BETTER CAMERA ,DUAL CORE PROCESSR, MALI 400 GPU,HD PHN... A MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE, 264 PPI 3.7"" SCREEN AND AT A GUD 1500 RS LESS IN PRICE
      
      THE ONLY CONS ARE A 1320 MAH BATTERY AND A STIFF CAMERA BUTTON WHICH CAN BE NEGLECTED IF YOU REQUIRE THAT CONFIG
      
      ..GO FOR J ONLY IF YOU WANT TO HOLD AN ELEGANT AND AN EYE CATCHING  PHOWN , HAVE A  DIGI CAM AT HOME AND PREFER PLAYING HD GAMES ON 21"" COMPUTER RATHER THAN ON A 3.7"" CELLPHONE :)
      
      P.S DECIDE IN YOUR MIND, CD 100(XPERIA SOLA) OR APACHE(XPERIA J) WHICH ONE YOU WOULD CHOOSE (CD 100 HAS AN AVG OF 85 COMPARED TO APCHES 45 AND A MUCH STRONGER AND DURABLE STEEL BODY :P)
      
      
      VERDICT - YOU SHOULD GO FOR THE PHONE ONLY IF DONT REQUIRE  HARD GAMING, A SLR QUALITY PICS FROM A CELLPHN, AND A LIGHTNING FAST PROCESSING SPEED WHICH SAVES NEARLY 2-3 MINS A DAY FROM YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE
      
      OTHER THAN THT . THIS IS A MID RANGE PHONE YOU WERE SEARCHING FOR. :)"
Xperia J,4,"NEWLY LAUNCHED XPERIA J IS MOSTLY GETTING COMPARED WITH XPERIA GO BY SONY FAN FOLLOWERS.
      
      HERE ARE SOME FACTS:
      
      1. SCREEN: J HAS 4 INCH SCREEN (854X480 FWVGA - FULL WIDE VIDEO GRAPHICS ARRAY) WHERE GO HAS 3.5 INCH SCREEN (480X320 HVGA HALF SIZE VIDEO GRAPHICS ARRAY). THOUGH RESOLUTION OF GO SEEMS TO BE LESSER THAN J, IT HAS MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE GIVING AWESOME DISPLAY FOR VIDEO, PHOTO ETC. DUE TO MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE, LOWER SCREEN RESOLUTION DOESN'T MATTER IN GO WHEREAS J DOESN'T HAVE MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE.
      
      
      2. CPU &AMP; GPU: XPERIA GO IS MUCH AHEAD THAN XPERIA J IN CPU AS WELL AS GPU. GO IS EQUIPPED WITH 1 GHZ CORTEX-A9, DUAL CORE AND ARM MAIL 400 WHERE AS J IS EQUIPPED WITH 1 GHZ CORTEX-A5 AND ADRENO 200. HAVING A9 DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, GO IS BETTER PERFORMING THAN J. ALSO MAIL400 AGAIN COVER THE LOW RESOLUTION OF GO COMPARED WITH ADRENO 200 OF J.
      
      
      3. MEMORY: BOTH MOBILES ARE HAVING 512 MB RAM. GO IS INBUILT WITH 8GB MEMORY (APPROX. 4GB USER AVAILABLE MEMORY) AND J WITH 4GB PHONE MEMORY (APPROX. 2.2 GB USER MEMORY). BOTH SUPPORTS UPTO 32GB MICRO SD CARD.
      
      
      4. GO IS HAVING 107KBPS GPRS &AMP; 296KBPS EDGE SPEED WHEREAS J SUPPORTS 86KBPS GPRS AND 237KBPS EDGE SPEED. FAST WEB BROWSING IN GO.
      
      
      5. OTHER POINTS: NO FRONT CAMERA IN GO, J DOES HAVE.
      
      HD RECORDING WITH 5MP CAMERA IN GO, J IS HAVING VGA RECORDING WITH 5MP CAMERA.
      
      OS FOR J IS ANDROID 4 ICS WHEREAS FOR GO IT IS ANDROID 2.3 GINGERBREAD. RECENTLY IN NEWS, GO IS NOW UPGRADABLE TO ANDROID 4 ICS.
      
      GO IS WATER RESISTANT AND DUST FREE.
      
      
      OVERALL, EXCEPT ABSENCE OF FRONT CAMERA, GO IS THE CHOICE AS IN MOST OF THE POINTS, GO IS WAY AHEAD THAN J."
Xperia J,4,NICE PHONE FOR NORMAL USE... NOT GOOD FOR GAMING... YOU CAN GET 1 DAY BATTERY BACKUP WITH ALL DAY INTERNET USE AND 2 HRS OF TALKING..... ITS A GOOD PHONE ON THAT RANGE... DISPLAY AND PICTURE QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD....
Xperia J,4,"NICE PHONE... GOOD LOOKS AND BATTERY BACK UP.
      
      CAMERA IS OK...
      
      RAM OF 1 GB WOULD HAVE MADE THIS PHONE IDEAL.
      
      SOUND/MUSIC QUALITY IS GOOD AS WELL.
      
      
      FINALLY GO FOR THIS PHONE IF YOUR BUDGET IS AROUND 15K AND U NEED STYLISH PHONE."
Xperia J,4,"NOT SATISFIED WITH HEADSETTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!'
      
      GAMES, TEMPLE RUN BRAVE, IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY
      
      PHONE IS GETTING HOT WHEN IT IS KEPT TO CHARGING. '
      
      
      NOT UP TO THE MARK!!!!!
      
      
      DID A MISTAKE BY CHOOSING WRONG PHONE.
      
      
      I HATE SAMSUNG BRAND PHONES, HOWEVER, I'M IN LOVE AT SAMSUNG GRAND AND S DUOS."
Xperia J,4,"PROS
      
      -  RESPONDS DECENTLY FAST AND IT WILL NOT IRRITATE YOU.
      
      -  GOOD BATTERY LIFE, GIVES DECENT 8-10 HOURS EVEN WITH DATA ACTIVE
      
      -  SCREEN RESOLUTION IS NICE AND GOOD FOR MEDIA AS THIS GOT A 4"" SCREEN
      
      
      CONS
      
      -  USB CHARGING DOESN'T WORK WITH ALL THE STANDARD/COMPATIBLE CABLES, I DON'T KNOW WHY IT ONLY WORKS WITH THE CABLE GIVEN WITH PHONE ONLY.
      
      -  CHARGING THE BATTERY TAKES VERY LONG TIME (ALMOST 3+ HOURS FOR FULL CHARGE)
      
      -  CAMERA WILL DISAPPOINT YOU IF YOU EXPECT SO MUCH AS IT IS SLOW AND MISSES TO FOCUS OBJECTS EVERY NOW AND THEN, DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING FROM SECONDARY CAMERA.
      
      -  I DON'T USE THE EAR PHONES THAT CAME ALONG WITH PHONE, I AM NOT SURE WHATS WRONG WITH 3.5MM JACK, MY BOSE EARPHONES DOESN'T WORK WITH THIS, THIS DISAPPOINTED ME A LOT :-(
      
      
      OVERALL, GIVEN THE PRICE AND THE SERVICE FROM FLIKART, I WILL RATE THIS 4* AS SOME PROBLEMS I LISTED ARE SPECIFIC TO ME."
Xperia J,4,"SONY XPERIA J BLACK MOBILE AWESOME IN FEATURES, FLIPKART IS GIVING A VERY GOOD SERVICE IN ALL ITEMS. YOU WANT A HIGH DEFINITION MOBILE THEN I PREFERRED TO GO WITH SONY ONLY BECAUSE SONY QUALITY IN PHOTOS AND VIDEO HAS GOOD COMPARE TO OTHERS. BATTERY CONSUMPTION IS LOW. ANDROID 4.0 ICE CREAM SANDWICH IS OS IS GOOD AND HAVING MANY FEATURES COMPARE TO ANDROID 2.3."
Xperia J,4,"SONY XPERIA J HAS SERVED MY PURPOSE. I WANTED GOOD GAMING SMARTPHONE WITH DECENT CAMERA AND GPS.ITS 4"""" SCREEN IS SUPERB AND LOOKS NICE. IT HAS INHERITED ITS QUALITY FROM SONY BRAND.I HAVE BEEN PLANNING FOR A LONG TO BUY A SMARTPHONE UNDER 18K WHICH COULD OFFER FEATURES LIKE SCREEN SIZE, GOOD GRAPHICS , PROCESSOR SPEED AND I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE 1 WEEK AGO AND IT HAS PRETTY WELL CAME UP TO MY EXPECTATION
      
      PROS:
      
      NICE AND DECENT LOOK
      
      LARGE SCREEN
      
      GOOD GRAPHICS

      BATTERY(NOT AS EXPECTED WITH 1700 MAH)
      
      GPU(COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER)"
Xperia J,4,"THE LOOKS OF THE PHONE IS EXCELLENT. EXPERIENCED LAG WHILE PLAYING GAMES. CAMERA IS OK .
      
      PERFORMANCE IS LESSER COMPARED TO HTC PHONE(DESIRE V) WITH SAME PROCESSOR BUT THIS ONE HAS FRONT CAM. WORTH FOR THE PRICE IT COMES AT."
Xperia J,4,"THE ONLY DRAWBACKS ARE THAT IT IS NOT DUAL CORE AND NOT EVEN HALF HD...
      
      NICE GRAPHICS AND GOOD LOOKS WITH ITS ANDROID VERSION UPGRADABLE TO JELLY BEAN.... IT IS A GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY...................................................!!!"
Xperia J,4,"THE PHONE HAS ITS PROS AND CONS..
      
      
      DEFAULT HEADSETS ARE NOT GOOD..PHONE IS LAGGY SOMETIMES..PICTURES CAPTURED WITH FLASH ARE NOT SATISFACTORY. THE ILLUMINATION SYSTEM STOPPED WORKING FROM THE SECOND DAY :(
      
      
      I BROUGHT SKULL CANDY (SMOKING BUDS) FOR THIS PHONE AND IT JUST BLOWS ME AWAY, FEELS LIKE ABSOLUTE BLISS..
      
      
      DISPLAY IS REALLY NICE, MY FRIEND ASKED ME IF ITS A AMOLED..HE HE
      
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS REALLY REALLY GOOD.. ON AN AVERAGE I LISTEN TO 2 HOURS OF MUSIC AND 4 HOURS ON BRIDGE CALLS. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT WILL STILL HAVE 40-50% OF POWER LEFT."
Xperia J,4,"THIS IS THE PHONE WHICH COVER ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES WITH 4' GREAT DISPLAY.IF YOU ARE HEAVY GAMER THEN DON'T BUY IT BUT IF U WANT ALL STUFF IN ONE THEN AND THEN ONLY GO FOR IT.
      
      THE PHONE IS LAGGING SOME TIMES BT OVER ALL IS GOOD. I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR USING ANDROID AND I DONT NEED TO SHOOT OR WATCH 1280 * 1080 P MOVIE BECOZ I HAVE DIGITAL CAM &AMP; LED TV SO I NEVER USE FOR IT BUT U CAN USE MX PLAYER FOR IT AND OTHER THING ABOUT LOOK OF PHONE ""IT'S J"" MEANS PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS JEALOUS FOR U AND IWILL SUGGEST U THIS PHONE AND IF U WANT TO GO FOR SAMSUNG THEN DON'T GO FOR IT BECAUSE IT HAVE SAME UI AS PENTA AND MICROMAX AND U SHOULD GO FOR IT NOT SAMSUNG SO DONT RESIST JUST BUY IT."
Xperia J,4,"TO START WITH THE SERVICE OF FLIPKART, ITS AS GOOD AS KNIFE IN BUTTER. THERE ARE LOTS OF TECH REVIEWS SO DON'T WANT TO GO INTO MUCH DETAIL. I WAS LOOKING FOR A GOOD MID RANGE MOBILE. SORTED OUT GALAXY S ADVANCE, EXPERIA J AND EXPERIA U. ALL THE THREE ARE ROCKING UNDER 15000 RANGE.
      
      THINGS THAT I KEPT IN MY MIND CONSIDERING THE ABOVE 3:
      
      1. INTERNAL MEMORY.
      
      2. SCREEN SIZE.
      
      3. SECONDARY CAMERA.
      
      OBVIOUSLY THE PROCESSOR AND INTERNAL MEMORY OR RAM TOO CAME INTO MY CONSIDERATION.  THE CAMERA NOT THE BEST BUT GOOD IN THIS RANGE, THOUGH PRICE A LITTLE HIGH. BUT CONSIDERING OTHER MARKET AVAILABILITIES I WILL SAY IT'S GOOD. I HAVE BEEN USING SMARTPHONE SINCE ITHE SMARTPHONES CAME TO THE MARKET OF INDIA.  I AM A MODERATE USER OF A PHONE INCLUSIVE OF GAMING, NET USAGE AND CALL ALSO HUGE PHOTOGRAPHY.
      
      BATTERY BACKUP IS MODERATE FOR XPERIA J , IT STANDS GOOD FOR A DAY AND A HALF WITH ONE TIME CHARGE. SONY HAS PROVIDED THE INBUILT SOFTWARE TO SYNC IT WITH PC WHICH WON'T B FOUND IN SAMSUNG EVEN AT HIGHER RANGES LIKE I DON'T HAVE IT IN S2.
      
      
      PROS AT THIS PRICE:
      
      1. BATTERY-LI-ION, 1700 MAH
      
      2. SIZE 4 INCHES
      
      3. SIM CARD ADAPTOR. SUPPORTING BOTH KIND OF SIM (MICRO &AMP; REGULAR).
      
      4. PROCESSOR 1 GHZ CORTEX-A5
      
      5. 3G : 7.2 MBPS HSDPA; 5.76 MBPS HSUPA
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      1. CAMERA NOT THAT GOOD BEING 5MP, FRONT CAMERA COULD HAVE BEEN 2MP OR 1.3 MP AS SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE COMES WITH IT.
      
      
      2. MAY BE A LITTLE MORE RAM.
      
      
      REST I FIND IT TO BE A DECENT MOBILE FOR REGULAR USAGE. WANT HD GAMING AND GOOD PHOTOGRAPHY GO BEYOND 20K."
Xperia J,4,"WHEN MY BLACKBERRY WENT INTO THE WASHING MACHINE WITH MY TROUSER I DESPERATELY NEEDED A PHONE, SMARTPHONE (WITH ATLEAST 4 INCH SCREEN) I SHOULD SAY. BUDGET: 18000-22000, IF CAN FIND A GOOD ONE BUDGET WAS EXTENDABLE. TRULY SPEAKING THERE NO GOOD ALL-IN-ONE PHONE IN THE MARKET AT PRESENT.
      
      
      STARTED WITH NOKIA 820: LOST IN FIRST PHASE, OVERPRICED, BORING OS, UTTERLY DISAPPOINTING CAMERA QUALITY, THOUGH IT WAS BLAZING FAST PERFORMER.
      
      
      SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE: WAS VERY IMPRESSED. OVERALL, THE BEST PHONE IN MARKET WITH PRICE RANGE 19000-20000. BUT GINGERBREAD, DEEPER POSITION OF SCREEN AND QUITE AN OLD PHONE.
      
      
      HTC DESIRE X: LOW ON SPECS BUT PRICED ALMOST SIMILAR TO GALAXY S ADVANCE, NO FRONT CAM- NOT VFM.
      
      
      SONY XPERIA J: QUITE A LOOKER, CRISP SCREEN, VERY LOW ON SPECS BUT MY HEART WAS SAYING GO FOR IT, MY MIND WAS TELLING NO.
      
      
      SAMSUNG GRAND DUOS: I HATE DUAL SIM. BUT IT'S SPECS ALMOST KILLED ME AND SOLIDLY BUILT TOO. BUT LOOKING AT THE HUGE SCREEN: THE OOMPH, THE ZING IS MISSING. IT'S SCREEN, HOWEVER BIG IT MAY BE, HAS NO LIFE AND WAS TELLING ME ""I AM A 'CHEAP' PHONE.
      
      
      ALL OF A SUDDEN WENT TO STORE- BOUGHT XPERIA J. I KNEW ITS CONS, SOME HOW THOSE FAILED TO RESIST ME.
      
      
      REVIEW:
      
      
      LOOK AT THE PHONE: WOW.
      
      LOOK AT THE SCREEN: WOW!!! CRISP, PIXELS HARDLY NOTICEABLE.
      
      BUILD QUALITY: GOOD FEELINGS ON HAND GRIP, BUT SURLY NOT PRECISELY BUILT: ALL-PLASTIC CHEAP FEELINGS ON CLOSER INSPECTION.
      
      CAMERA: GOOD ONE. BUT NOT EXCELLENT. REVIEWS SAYS DISTANCE PHOTOS A BAD, MACROS ARE GOOD. TRUE, UNTIL YOU SET THE FOCUS MANUALLY TO INFINITY. AFTER THAT, CAMERA DOES PERFECT JOB.
      
      SOUND: PRETTY NICE ON SUPPLIED HEADPHONES. EXCELLENT ON SONY MDR-EX100LP.
      
      PERFORMANCE: 1 GHZ SINGLE CORE ADRENO ENHANCED 200 DOES THE DAY-TO-DAY JOB. IT NEVER LAGGED OR HANGED EVEN AFTER INSTALLING 37 APPS. RAM IS ENOUGH. DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE KEEP COMPLAINING ABOUT HANGING PROBLEMS, PROBABLY THEY DON'T CLOSE THE PREVIOUSLY USED APPS PROPERLY.
      
      KEYBOARD: VERY NICE AND EASY TO USE.
      
      INTERFACE: VERY SMOOTH AND SMART INTERFACE. LOOKS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD AND NOWAY BORING.
      
      BATTERY: FAIR ENOUGH FOR 1.5 DAYS. WITH DATA CONNECTION OFF IT LASTS EVEN UPTO 3 DAYS WITH 45 MINS OF TALKING EVERY DAY.
      
      
      WHERE IT LACKS:
      
      IT LAGS WHEN YOU SIMULTANEOUSLY KEEP 4-5 APPS OPEN.
      
      IT HEATS UP ON PLAYING TEMPLE RUN AND WHEN YOU USE MAPS OR DOWNLOADS SOMETHING OVER NET.
      
      IT BECOME UNRESPONSIVE WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO LAPTOP VIA USB (INSTALLING PC COMPANION S/W HELPS ENOUGH THOUGH TO CURE THIS PROBLEM), NO SUCH ISSUE ON WALL CHARGING.
      
      FRONT CAM PRETTY BAD.
      
      TAKES A BIT TIME TO OPEN HEAVY APPS AND 3 SECONDS TO OPEN CAMERA.
      
      NO AMBIENT SENSOR A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.
      
      MULTI-TASKING IS A PAIN. IF YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC AND TRY TO DO OTHER THINGS, THE SOUNDS GET DISTORTED- THE PROCESSOR SHOWS LACK OF POWER.
      
      HAND WRITING RECOGNITION ONLY ON CHINESE KEYBOARD INPUT METHOD.
      
      A BIT OVERPRICED COMPARED TO THE OTHER PHONES WITH SIMILAR SPECS. BUT STILL IT STANDS APART.
      
      
      BUT, OVERALL A VERY DESCENT PACKAGE ON SUCH A PRICE. IF YOU ARE NOT A HEAVY GAMER, IT'S A IDEAL STYLISH AND COMPETENT ANDROID PHONE.
      
      
      UPDATE: ON 8/03/2013 I GOT 4.1.2 JELLY BEAN. I WAS APPREHENSIVE BEFORE UPGRADING WHETHER THIS PHONE CAN HANDLE JB. BUT THE TRUE FACT IS THAT, NOW MULTI-TASKING IS A LOT EASIER. NO MORE DISTORTED SOUND OR LAG ON MULTI-TASKING. THE UI HAVE BECOME BUTTERY SMOOTH. NOTIFICATION TOOGLE AND GOOGLE NOW HAVE BEEN ADDED. BECAME A BIT FASTER TOO."
Xperia J,3,"ANDROID 4.0: I CAN'T ADD ANYTHING MORE THAN IS KNOWN. ADROID IS GREAT. OPERATING SYSTEM WAS MY FIRST CRITERIA OF CHOOSING ANY PHONE.
      
      
      LOOK AND FEEL: THIS PHONE LOOKS PRETTY AWESOME TO ME. IT IS SLEEK AND HAS A NICE GRIP ON THE BACK COVER.
      
      
      SIZE AND WEIGHT: 4 INCH SCREEN SEEMS JUST RIGHT TO HOLD AND CARRY AND GOOD ENOUGH FOR READING. 5 INCH WOULD HAVE BEEN A PAIN.
      
      
      SCREEN: LARGE SCREEN IS GOOD FOR READING EBOOKS, COMICS OR NEWS/ARTICLES ON APPS. NICE TOUCH SENSITIVITY.
      
      
      SPEAKERS ARE GOOD ENOUGH. DECENT LOUDNESS AND CLARITY.
      
      
      CAMERA IS JUST AVERAGE. WONT SAY ITS GOOD. TAKES TIME TO FOCUS N ALL.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE: DIDN'T EXPECT 1GHZ PHONE TO BE SO SLOW AND HANG A FEW TIMES. OK, I ACCEPT THAT I INSTALLED A LOT OF APPS. BUT I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE ANY LIMITATION. HAD IT BEEN MORE FLUID WITH THE PERFORMANCE, GAMING WOULD BE A LOT BETTER.
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT: IT SEEMS THAT THIS RANGE 15-20K INR PHONES ARE JUST LIKE THIS. INSTEAD OF SPENDING ON A PHONE OF SIMILAR QUALITY, YOU CAN EITHER GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL 25K RANGE OR BUY CANVAS 2 BY MICROMAX IF YOU CAN RELAX YOUR BRAND REQUIREMENTS. BUT IF YOU CAN FORGIVE A BIT OF SLOW PERFORMANCE. THIS PHONE IS FINE."
Xperia J,3,"AWESOME PHONE IN LOOK.  BUT DURING THE PAST TWO WEEKS, I FEEL LOTS OF TIME MY PHONE IS STUCK DUE TO THE WEAK PROCESSOR.  ALSO I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HEAVY BATTERY IS EMPTY EVEN I USED THE POWER SAVER OPTION WITH LESS BACK LIGHT, SYNC, GPS, WIFI, BLUETOOTH OFF.
      
      
      BIT EXPENSIVE WHEN COMPARING WITH SIMILAR PHONES IN MARKET."
Xperia J,3,"BELOW ARE THE PROBLEMS I AM FACING WITH THIS PHONE:
      
      1. TOUCH DOES NOT RESPOND SOMETIMES WHILE ACCEPTING/REJECTING CALLS &AMP; UNLOCKING PHONE.
      
      2. PHONE SPEAKER(NOT LOUD SPEAKER) DOES NOT WORK SOMETIMES; DUE TO THIS WE CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN ON CALL
      
      3. THERE IS A DEAD PIXEL IN GREEN COLOR WHICH DOES NOT DISAPPEAR
      
      
      PHONE IS OK OTHERWISE."
Xperia J,3,"GO FOR THIS MOBILE, IF YOU CARE SONY BRANDING.
      
      
      BASICALLY I A SONY FAN, BUT I WOULD SAY THIS IS NOT A VFM. I BOUGHT MY HTC DESIRE TWO YEARS BACK, IT HAS GOT ALL THE FEATURES EXCEPT A DUAL CORE.
      
      
      THE BEST PART IS AWESOME ICS PERFORMANCE.
      
      SECOND GOOD THIS IS BATTERY. I'M NOT SAYING IT WILL LAST LONG FOR 2 OR THREE DAYS, BUT WILL LAST ONE TO ONE AND HALF DAY DECENTLY.
      
      THE WORST IS CAMERA!! SONY IS ONE OF THE BEST IN MOBILE CAMERA. BUT THIS ONE IS REALLY BAD. NO DEDICATED BUTTON FOR CAMERA. FRONT CAMERA IS TOTALLY WASTE. 5MB BACKSIDE CAMERA REQUIRES A LOT OF LIGHT.
      
      
      ALSO SCREEN SIZE IS LESS, BUT IT IS OK."
Xperia J,3,"GOOD PHONE WITH GRATE MUSIC AND DISPLAY, THIS PHONE IS FOR NORMAL USER NOT FOR HARD CORE ANDROID USER BECAUSE NOT SO GOOD SPEC LIKE GOOD RAM AND PROCESSOR. ONE THING THAT REALLY DISAPPOINT ME THAT IS SONY CUSTOM UI, WHICH IS NOT SO GOOD AS SAMSUNG AND HTC SEANCE UI. OTHERWISE REST IS OK LIKE NORMAL ANDROID PHONE,"
Xperia J,3,"HERE FLIPKART SHOWING THE SECONDARY CAMERA AS 0.3 MP BUT IT IS NOT. ACTUALLY IS A VGA. PRIMARY CAMERA IS GOOD. GOOD FOR SIMPLE USE. MORE APPLICATION, THAN IT SLOWS THE PROCESS. THE SCREEN SHOULD HAVE SOME MORE GOOD QUALITY, IT LEAVES FINGER PRINTS. THE CABINET SEEMS LIKE IT IS MADE UP OF SOME CHEAP MATERIALS. THE BATTERY COVER IS NOT EASY TO OPEN."
Xperia J,3,"I AM USING THIS PHONE SINCE DECEMBER 2012
      
      PROS:
      
      ALL THE INTERNET RELATED STUFF WORKS EXCELLENT WITH NO PERFORMANCE ISSUES.
      
      I HAVE CONFIGURED MY OFFICE EMAILS , 3 GMAIL ID'S , USE MANY APPS AT A TIME AND THE PERFORMANCE IS VERY GOOD
      
      SCREEN RESOLUTION AND DISPLAY IS AWESOME
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD DURING THE DAY AND CLICKS NICE PICS
      
      SOUND IS GOOD BUT STILL NOT UPTO THE STANDARDS SONY HAS SET.
      
      CONS
      
      ITS SLOWER ON THE BASIC PHONE FEATURES LIKE WHEN LOADING CALL LOG , CONTACT LOG AND ALBUM.
      
      NOT A GOOD PHONE FOR GAMERS ( M NOT ONE OF THOSE )
      
      
      SO IF YOU NEED A PHONE FOR MORE OF INTERNET RELATED STUFF AND DON'T WANT TO SPEND MORE AMOUNT YOU CAN GO AHEAD WITH XPERIA J ."
Xperia J,3,"I BOUGHT IT 2 WEEKS BACK @ 15.6K 4M FLIPKART .WITHIN A WEEKS TIME IT'S PRICE IS DROPPED  BY 1.2K , WHICH INDICATES THAT THE DEMAND FOR THIS PHONE IS LOW .
      
      AGREED THAT THE ""SONY"" BRAND VALUE IS GOOD , BT STILL THESE TECH SPEC IS PITTY MUCH OUTDATED .
      
      
      NW THAT BEING SAID MY REVIEW ABOUT THIS PHONE ,
      
      1. EVEN THOUGH THE PIXCEL DENCITY IS LOW IN ""NUMBERS"" COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES THE DISPLAY QUALITY IS VERY GOOD . IT DOSEN'T MAKE SENCE TO HAV A VERY HIGH PIXCEL DENCITY ON A SCREEN OF 4INCH , PROBABLY THAT Y SONY CHOSE THIS UNIQUE PIXCEL DENCITY .
      
      
      2. THE BUILD QLALITY IS VERY GOOD . IN THE VERY 1ST WEEK I BOUGHT TIS PHONE I DROPPED IT 4M MY TABLE , BT THERE'S NT EVEN A SINGLE SCRATCH ANYWHERE .
      
      SONY HAS PT A LOTS OF TOUGHT ON THE DIMENTIONS OF THE PHONE , IT'S EASLY OPERATABLE WITH SINGLE HAND .
      
      UPON THAT IN THE RARE END OF THE PHONE IS CONCAVE IN SHAPE AND IT KINDA FELLS LIK RUBBER , HENCE GIVING GOOD GRIP .(HENCE IT DROPPED 4M MY TABLE NT 4M MY HAND).
      
      
      3.PROCESSOR OF THIS PHONE SUCKS BIG TIME , PROBABLY SONY WAS NT TAGETING GAMERS FOR THIS PHONE , SOMTIMES I COULDN'T HELP NOTICE A SLIGHT LAG IN THE PHONE ... BT SINCE IM A WINDOWS USER I OVERLOOKED THESE DEFECTS .
      
      
      4.BCOS OF THE LIMITATION OF THE RAM AND POOR PROCESSOR I DON'T THINK V WIL GET ANY JB UPDATE TO THIS PHONE .
      
      
      5. BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD , I WIL B USING 3G THE WHOLE DAY BT STILL AT NIT B4 I PUT IT FOR CHARGING I STILL C 30% CHARGE LEFT .
      
      
      6. I TAUGHT THE CAM QUALITY WAS POOR , BT IT WAS DUE TO THE PROTECTIVE COVER ON THE LENSE , ONCE I REMOVED IT I COULD C THAT THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS GOOD .
      
      
      MY ULTIMATE VERDICT :
      
      GO FOR THIS PONE IF UR A EBOOK READER (I SHOULD CONFESS I'M A HUGE KINDLE FAN) OR PLANNING TO BROWSE INTERNET  , OR JUST TO CHECK EMAILS ETC,.
      
      DON'T GO FOR THIS IF UR A GAMER ,
      
      AND EVEN THOUGH THERE R RUMERS THAT SONY WIL GIV A UPRGRADE TO JB , I REKON THAT IT MIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE OVERAL PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE , DUE TO IT'S LOW RAM AND IT'S SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR .
      
      
      PS: JUST BARE IN MIND THAT IT'S A MID RANGE PHONE ."
Xperia J,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE LAST WEEK.FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT BEFORE BUYING.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO SPECIFIC PEOPLE.HERE IT GOES WHY:-
      
      PROS:-
      
      1)LOOKS &AMP; FEEL GREAT.REALLY STYLISH.
      
      2)GREAT BATTERY LIFE COMPARED TO OTHER ANDROID PHONES I HAVE USED.LASTS ALMOSTS 1.5 DAYS WITH MODERATE USAGE.
      
      3)DESPITE ITS VERY NEGETIVE REVIEW ON CNET ABOUT ITS SLUGGISHNESS,I PERSONALLY FOUND EVERYTHING VERY SMOOTH.
      
      3)ITS ON THE LIST TO BE UPGRADED TO JELLY BEAN.
      
      4)SOUND IS GREAT(SPEACIALLY BECOZ OF WALKMAN APP AND ITS EQUILIZERS).
      
      5)HAS 4"" BIG SCREEN ,AND ITS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
      
      6)CAMERA HAS MANY MODES LIKE NIGHT,BEACH,SPORTS ETC.
      
      7)HAS DLNA(CAN TRAMIT MEDIA TO OTHER PHONES/DEVICES),ITS A MUST HAVE IF YOU HAVE A SONY
      
      WIRELESS COMPATIBLE TV.
      
      8)FACE UNLOCK,I THINK ITS REALLY COOL FEATURE OF ICS OS.
      
      9)TIMESCAPE FEATURES ARE REALLY GOOD.GOOD FOR FACEBOOK,TWITTER ETC.
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      1)HEADPHONES ARE WHITE IN COLOR EVEN WITH BLACK PHONE,IF YOU ARE SPECIFIC ABOUT STYLE WELL..
      
      
      2)IT HAS A 2 GB INTERNAL STORAGE AND 754 MB PHONE MEMORY.IT SUPPORTS EXTERNAL SD CARD(SD-EXT PARTITION).
      
      HERE IT GETS TRICKY,YOU CAN STORE APPS TO ONLY INTERNAL 2 GB MEMORY AND NOT THE EXTERNAL
      
      SD CARD.APP2SD WILL ONLY MOVE IT TO 'INTERNAL MEMOMY' OF 2 GB AND NOT YOUR EXPANDABLE SD CARD.
      
      YOU CAN USE YOUR EXPANDABLE SD CARD FOR STORING MOVIES ,PICS &AMP; MUSIC ONLY.
      
      APP DATA WILL GET STORED IN THE INTERNAL STORAGE OF 2GB.
      
      YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT LOCATION OF BROWSER,WALKMAN,CAMERA TO EXTERNAL SD CARD.
      
      
      3)SHOOTS ONLY VGA VIDEO.
      
      4)DOESN'T HAVE SONY BRAVIA ENGINE,I PERSONALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH BUT HEARD THAT OTHER
      
      PHONES HAVE IT.
      
      5)SILICONE CASE NOT AVAILABLE ON MARKET CURRENTLY DUE TO ITS NEW ARRIVAL IN INDIAN MARKET.
      
      USE CAREFULLY UNTIL IT ARRIVES.
      
      
      OVERALL ITS A VERY GOOD PHONE FOR EVERYONE AS YOU CAN SEE IN PROS.FOR POWER USES YOU WANT TO DIG INTO THE TECNICALITY BETTER BE AWARE OF THE FEATURES BEFORE HAND,BUT FOR THEM ROOTING MAY BE AN ANSWER."
Xperia J,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE TWO DAYS AGO AND I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED AT THE TOUCH INTERFACE AND ITS SENSITIVITY. UNLOCKING THE SCREEN ITSELF CAN BE FRUSTRATING. ALSO IF YOU HAVE MADE ANY SHORTCUTS ON THE HOME SCREEN, HOW DOES ONE REMOVE THEM? I TRIED HOLDING IT AND MOVING IT TO THE RECYCLE BIN THAT POPS UP BELOW, BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO IT. CAN ANYONE SUGGEST PLEASE?"
Xperia J,3,"I DONT KNOW HOW THEY GIVE 5 OR 4 RATINGS TO THIS LAGGY PHONE.
      
      GUYS THIS PHONE DONT WORTH A BUY ,IF U ARE A LOVER OF SONY BRAND THEN WITH THE SAME 16K RANGE SONY XPERIA NEO L WHICH IS FAR BETTER THAN THIS."
Xperia J,3,"I HAVE  BROUGHT THIS PRODUCT IN MONTH OF DECEMBER  BUT NOW I M NOT  SURE ITS ORIGINAL OR DUPLICATE.
      
      I HAVE A SONY J MADE IN CHINA BROUGHT FROM SONY SHOWROOM HERE IN GOA
      
      IN BEING ITS WAS  WORKING PROPERLY,.... NOW I DON'T NO WHAT HAPPENED"
Xperia J,3,"I HAVE MYSELF USED XPERIA GO N J:LIKED BOTH OF EM A LOT!!!
      
      BUT XPERIA GO IS BETTER
      
      
      XPERIA U PROS:
      
      1) ITS I GHZ DUAL CORE,FASTER THAN XPERIA J,
      
      
      2)ITS GOT MALI400 GPU,IDEAL FOR PLAYING GAMES,ALSO BETTER THAN XPERIA J'S ADRENO200
      
      
      3)8GB INTERNAL VS 4 GB.XPERIA U DOESNT GET AN SD CARD SUPPORT.
      
      
      4)280PPI........BETTER THAN 245 ON XPERIA J
      
      
      5)HD CAMERA....YES BETTER THAN STANDARD VGA AND IT ALSO HAS AN FRONT FACING CAM
      
      
      6)U CAN GET IT UNDER RS15000
      
      
      HERE ARE SOME CONS:
      
      
      1)BATTERY LIFE IS LESS 1320 MAH VS 1750 MAH ON J
      
      
      2)3.5 INCH VS 4 INCH ON XPERIA J (NOT A PROBLEM AS IPHONE 4S ALSO HAS AN 3.5 INCH DISPLAY)THAN TOO ITS A CON
      
      
      SO EXPECT MORE OUT OF THE BOX BY BUYING XPERIA U AS AFTER THE SOFTWARE UPDATE IT WILL BE AN CLASSIC EXPERIENCE FOR U!!!!!!!
      
      THANK YOU!!!!
      
      HAPPY SHOPPING."
Xperia J,3,"I JUST PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR MY WIFE. IT HAS A GOOD CAMERA 5MP CAMERA, GOOD 4 INCH SCREEN WITH A NICE RESOLUTION AND CORNING GORILLA GLASS. HEARING THE MUSIC PLAY ON IT IS QUITE GOOD. ITS TOUCH RECEPTIVENESS IS VERY GOOD WITH A SCREEN GUARD ON THE GLASS. BATTERY BACK UP IS OK TOO.
      
      
      VIDEO PLAYBACK ON THIS PHONE IS BAD. THIS PHONE DOES NOT OPEN ANY 720P OR 1080P VIDEOS WITH THE DEFAULT PLAYER. WITH THE MX PLAYER, 720P VIDEOS PLAY VERY SLOW OR WITH NO SOUND. 1080P VIDEOS JUST CRASH AFTER A SECOND OR TWO. LOWER RESOLUTION VIDEOS PLAY WELL. SIZE OF THE VIDEO FILE DOES NOT MATTER.
      
      
      MY WIFE JUST RETURNED THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF THE VIDEO PLAYBACK ISSUES."
Xperia J,3,"I WAS HAPPY THAT I GOT IT DELIVERED WITHIN 2 DAYS AND THE PHONE SOFTWARE IS AWESOME TOO WITH GOOD PERFORMANCE AND BATTERY BACKUP. BUT I FOUND A FEW HARDWARE PROBLEMS IN THE SET. I AM NOT SURE IF THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT OR THE PHONE IS BUILT LIKE THIS.
      
      
      DEFECT 1: THE POWER ON/OFF BUTTON IS LOOSE
      
      DEFECT 2: THE TOP-LEFT CORNER OF THE PHONE MAKES A SOUND WHEN PRESSED AS IF SOMETHING IS LOOSE INSIDE."
Xperia J,3,"I WOULD PERSONALLY CONSIDER XPERIA SOLA AS BOTH ARE IN THE SAME RANGE. SOLA HAS A DUAL CORE , MEANS CAN HANDLE 2 PROCESSES AT 1 GHZ SPEED WHEREAS J HAS ONLY SINGLE CORE. SOLA HAS MALI400 WHICH IS A BIG PLUS FOR GAMERS. AND ALSO VIDEO RECORDING IS IN 720P. THE ONLY FLAW IS THAT SOLA DOESNT HAVE A SECONDARY CAMERA. IF U WANT THAT GO FOR XPERIA U ( MY FAVOURITE). A BEAST WITH LESS MEMORY( OK FOR ME). SO CHECK OUT THOSE TWO BEFORE GOING FOR THIS. :)"
Xperia J,3,ITS GOOD.. BUT NOT SO GOOD AS I EXPECTED. CAMERA IS 5MP BUT THE PICTURE QUALITY IS NOT SO GOOD. BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO VERY LESS. SO SEE OTHER BETTER OPTIONS BEFORE BUYING........................................
Xperia J,3,"IV BEEN USING THE XPERIA J FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW AND HERES WHAT IV GOTTA SAY ABOUT IT :
      
      THE PHONE LOOKS AMAZING.THE SLIGHTLY CURVED BACKSIDE IS WORTH SHOWING OFF.THE DEVICE IS OF JUST THE RIGHT SIZE TO HOLD COMFORTABLY AND THE ASTHETIC QUALITY IS IMPROVED WITH THE BOTTOM LED THAT LIGHTSUP IN DIFFERENT COLORS DEPENDING ON THE DISPLAY THEME.
      
      NOW THE PERFOMANCE PART : THE SINGLE CORE 1 GHZ PROCESSOR CAN HANDLE ALMOST ALL EVERYDAY TASKS YOU THROW AT IT WITH CONSIDERABLE EASE . THOUGH GOTTA SAY IT WILL GASP FOR BREATH RUNNING HEAVY DUTY INTENSIVE PROCESSES LIKE VIDEO EDITING OR SIMILAR STUFF. THE GPU ADRENO 200 CAN DEAL WITH TEMPLE RUN AND THE USUAL STUFF SMOOTHLY , HOWEVER TRY TO RUN ANY OF THOSE GROUNDBREAKING GRAPHIC INTENSIVE GAMES AND IT WILL CHOKE .
      
      ANOTHER BIG POSITIVE COMING FROM SONY IS THE BATTERY LIFE. THE XPERIA J CAN DEFINITELY STAY ALIVE FOR A DAY WITH HEAVY USAGE AND IT CAN PROBABLY MAKE IT 2 DAYS WITH LIGHT TO MODERATE USAGE.
      
      NOW TO THE BIGGEST FLAW : THE CAMERA !! WELL, IT SUCKS. NOW DONT GET ME WRONG HERE.THE CAMERA HARDWARE I THINK IS PRETTY GOOD.BUT THE AUTOFOCUS SOFTWARE DEFINITELY HAS SOME ISSUES WHICH IM HOPING SONY WILL SORT IT OUT IN THE NEXT COMING UPDATE.( OH, BTW JELLY BEANS COMING FOR XPERIAJ BY 2013 )"
Xperia J,3,"MY FRIEND BOUGHT THIS MOBILE BEFORE 2 WEEKS..HE DIDNT PUT A MEMORY CARD TILL NOW.. I ASKED REVIEW ABOUT THIS MOBILE  .. HE TOLD MOBILE WAS HANGING EVERY TIME.SOMETIMES , IT AUTOMATICALLY GOES TO SWITCH OFF CONDITION.. DUE TO THIS PROBLEM ,HE WENT TO SONY SERVICE CENTER .THERE HE WAS SHOCKED ON SEEING ,MANY PEOPLE CAME WITH THE SAME PHONE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.. I ALSO THOUGHT TO BUY THIS PHONE WITHIN 2 DAYS.. ON HEARING THIS , I AM THINKING WHAT TO DO..
      
      HI SONY XPERIA J USERS , ANY BODY HAVE THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM .. PLEASE REPLY"
Xperia J,3,THIS PHONE IS CLEARLY UNDER POWERED BY SONY WITH JUST A SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR.COME ON YOU CAN GET NOKIA 620 WITH DUAL CORE S4 PROCESSOR FOR 15K OR EVEN LUMIA 520 FOR JUST RS 10500.BOTH THE PHONES WILL MAKE MORE SENSE THAN THIS ESPECIALLY AS IT RUNS ON ANDRIOID 4
Xperia J,3,"WELL TO BEGIN WITH THE LOOKS ARE EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!
      
      COMFORTABLE TO HOLD. CAMERA IS GOOD AND VIDEOS ARE ALSO EXCEPTABLE.
      
      TOUCH ANDROID 4 ICS IS QUITE GOOD AND IS ALSO UPGRADABLE TO JELLY BEAN WHEN IT COMES.
      
      BUT I AM NOT FULLY SATISFIED WITH THE PHONE AS GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN LAGS QUITE OFTEN. NOT A GAMERS PARADISE. 512MB RAM IS NOT ENOUGH YOU NEED MORE!"
Xperia J,3,"WHY YOU SHOULD BUY?
      
      1.	LOOKS AND INTERFACE IS TOO GOOD.
      
      2.	CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY GOOD.
      
      3.	VIDEO PLAYBACK QUALITY IS ALSO VERY NICE.
      
      4.	INTERNET IS FAST.
      
      5.	BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD.
      
      6.	NOTIFICATION LIGHTS A AWESOME.
      
      WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BUY?
      
      1.	HARDWARE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. SO IT WILL BECOME SLOW SOMETIMES.
      
      2.	MUSIC QUALITY IS NOT VERY NICE AND LOUD. YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR WON HEADPHONE AND HAVE TO CUSTOMIZE THE EQUALIZER TO MAKE IT LOUD.
      
      3.	CAN ONLY DETECT 2 FINGERS (SAMSUNG S DUOS CAN DETECT 5).
      
      4.	CAN NOT PLAY HIGH PROFILE GAMES.
      
      5.	CAN NOT CALL AND TEXT BY SLIDING CONTACT.
      
      6.	PROXIMITY CENSER IS ON THE LEFT SIDE. SO IF YOU PUT THE PHONE ON RIGHT SIDE IT WILL WORK PERFECTLY."
Xperia J,2,"CONFIG LOOKS OUTDATED. I DONT THINK THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY.
      
      GOOD THING ABOUT THIS XPERIA J IS BRAVIA ENGINE AND SLIM NOTHING ELSE.
      
      IT HAS VERY LOW GPU ADRENO 200. XPERIA TIPO/DUAL/MIRO HAS SAME GPU
      
      NO HD VIDEO RECORDING!
      
      
      ITS DEFINITELY  OVER PRICED."
Xperia J,2,"EXCELLENT FLIPKART SERVICE. BUT ALL THIS FOR A SLUGGISH MOBILE.
      
      ONLY LOOKS GOOD BUT ISNT REALLY WORTH IT EVEN AFTER THE PRICE SLASH.
      
      SONY NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THE PRICING AS NOKIA AND SAMSUNG PROVIDES REAL GOOD ALTERNATIVE. HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 3 MONTHS NOW.
      
      PROS:
      
      GOOD LOOKS
      
      NICE RUBBERISED FINISH.. GOOD TO GRIP

      VERY LESS RAM
      
      JB UPDATE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.
      
      CALL DROPS ARE FREQUENT. BAD MODEM.
      
      WORST EARPHONES FOR NEARLY 15K MOBILE."
Xperia J,2,"I MYSELF AM PLANNING TO BUY A MOBILE THIS DIWALI AND HENCE WENT THROUGH A LOT OF RESEARCH. WHAT I HAVE FOUND ABOUT MUCH ANTICIPATED J IS HERE -
      
      1. PATHETIC CAMERA AND VIDEO PLAYBACK - SAMPLE IMAGES ARE PRESENT IN CNET'S REVIEW OF J.
      
      2. SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR - IN ALMOST SAME RANGE YOU HAVE DEVICES WHICH OFFER DUAL CORE WITH 1GB RAM.
      
      3. TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE. - SERIOUSLY U DO NOT EXPECT A DROID WITH ICS TO RUN SMOOTHLY ON A SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR WITH JUST 512 MB OF RAM.
      
      4. SONY IS NOT PROMISING ANY UPDATE ON JELLYBEAN WITH THIS DEVICE.
      
      
      I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BROUGHT IT IF LOOKS AND DESIGN IS ALL THAT MATTERED FOR ME. BUT SINCERELY, I COUNT MORE ON PERFORMANCE. AND SO IF YOU DO, AVOID IT!!!"
Xperia J,2,"I THINK THAT SONY HAS PRICED THIS PHONE MUCH HIGHER THAN IT SHOULD BE. THE DUAL CORE XPERIA U IS AVAILABLE AT 15K. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IT HAS IS THE LIMITED MEMORY. THE XPERIA GO IS ALSO A BETTER OPTION COSTING JUST AROUND 1K MORE THAN THIS ONE. AS FAR AS THE UI IS CONCERNED, NEW SAMSUNG PHONES ARE THE BEST AT THIS TIME. THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS IS THE BEST IN THIS RANGE AND IT IS ALSO UPGRADEABLE TO JELLY BEAN (THIS ONE IS TOO). BELIEVE ME GUYS, WHEN I USED IT I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE UI AND AFTERWARDS WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE SONY ICS UI, I WAS NOT VERY HAPPY WITH IT. THE DESIRE V IS ALSO A VERY GOOD CHOICE AT THIS PRICE AND IS DEFINITELY MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ONE. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT HTC USES THE BEST MATERIALS TO MAKE THEIR PHONES, THEIR UI IS BETTER AND THEIR PHONES ARE MUCH MORE RELIABLE THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY'S, SO I THINK THAT PUTTING MONEY IN AN HTC PHONE IS BETTER."
Xperia J,2,"ITS AN NICE PHONE WITH BIGGER SCREEN AND VERY SLIM STYLISH IN DESIGN. ITS MUSIC QUALITY WAS GOOD.  CALL QUALITY ALSO GOOD. WE CAN WATCH MOVIES WITH THIS PHONE. BUT ONLY THING IS ITS NOT HD PHONE, IT CAN'T PLAY HD VIDEOS. BATTERY BACKUP WAS AMAZING. BUT I DIDN'T GET THE SCRATCH GUARD FOR THIS SCREEN, IN STORES THEY SAY ITS NEW PHONE SO IT WILL COME LATER. I THINK IT DOESN'T NEED A SCRATCH GUARD, COZ THIS CORNING GORILLA GLASS WORKS FINE.
      
      
      ITS ALL ABOUT DESIGN. NOT HARDWARE.U CANT PLAY GAMES WITH HIGH GRAPHICS IN THIS PHONE BUT WEB BROWSING IS KINDA OK.
      
      
      FOR THOSE TECH SAVVY PEOPLE : THIS USES CORTEX A5(WORST ONE AVAILABLE :| )AND ADRENO 200(EVEN HTC EXPLORER HAS THIS ) PLUS THERE IS NO AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR.
      
      
      THE PROCESSOR'S LACK OF COMPUTATIONAL POWER CAN BE FELT WHEN SURFING THE WEB AS WELL, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE STOCK BROWSER IS BEING USED, OR AN ALTERNATIVE SUCH AS CHROME. WHEN A RELATIVELY HEAVY WEB PAGE IS BEING DISPLAYED, ZOOMING IN AND OUT IS VERY CHOPPY, AND IT TAKES A WHILE BEFORE THE SECTION YOU ARE VIEWING GETS RENDERED. DISABLING THE PLUG-INS FROM THE BROWSER'S SETTINGS MENU DOES NOT IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCE BY MUCH.
      
      
      CAMERA:CAMERA SUCKS BIG TIME...PICTURES LOOK AS IF THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM A 3MP CAM , COLORS LOOK WASHED OUT.
      
      
      DON'T EVEN BOTHER, GUYS. THE SONY XPERIA J SEEMS LIKE A WORTHY PICK, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT CARRIES A VERY REASONABLE PRICE TAG, BUT CHANCES ARE YOU'LL BE DISAPPOINTED BY WHAT YOU'LL GET IN EXCHANGE. FOR A LOWER MID-RANGE SMARTPHONE, THE DEVICE HAS A DECENT BATTERY LIFE AND A GOOD-LOOKING DISPLAY, BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. THE SUB-PAR PERFORMANCE IS REALLY THE DEAL BREAKER IN THIS CASE, SO MY  ADVISE IS TO START LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE."
Xperia J,2,"NOT GOOD MUSIC OUTPUT .
      
      NOT EVEN ABLE TO PLAY TEMPLE RUN PROPERLY .
      
      THOUGH THE DISPLAY QUALITY IS AWESOME AND ALSO THE VIDEO PLAYBACK .
      
      HOWEVER THE BASIC THING FOR MUSIC LOVER'S IS SOUND WHICH IS NOT THERE."
Xperia J,2,"PEOPLE FALL FOR THE BRAND &AMP; GOOD CONFIGURATION ON SUCH A LOW PRICE, BUT IT IS NOT OF ANY USE IF IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY. THIS PHONE HANGS SO MUCH, ENOUGH TO MAKE UR LIFE HELL."
Xperia J,2,"PROS:-
      
      1. LOOKS.
      
      2. LOUDSPEAKER.
      
      3. SCREEN CLARITY.
      
      4. ICE-CREAM SANDWICH.
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      1. SOUND IN HEADPHONE IS VERY LOW AND NOT OF GREAT QUALITY INSPITE OF WALKMAN APP.
      
      2. VERY SLOW WITH 20-30 APPS.
      
      3. NOT USEFUL FOR PLAYING 3D GAMES LIKE FIFA, TEMPLE RUN ETC.
      
      4. NOT USEFUL TO PLAY HD VIDEOS. HENCE NO USE OF 4"" SCREEN :)
      
      5. SCREEN BECOMES UNRESPONSIVE FREQUENTLY. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EVENT UNLOCK OR RESTART YOUR CELL PHONE.
      
      6. MOSTLY NOT UPGRADABLE TO JELLYBEAN. JELLYBEAN REQUIRES DUAL CORE PROCESSORS WHICH IS LACKING IN XPERIA J.
      
      
      OVERALL:- IF YOU WANT A CELL PHONE TO LISTEN SONGS WITH BIG SCREEN TO WATCH SD VIDEOS AND PLAY VERY BASIC GAMES AND ULTIMATELY WANT TO BROWSE WITHOUT INSTALLING MUCH APPS, THEN YOU MAY GO FOR THIS PHONE. OTHERWISE DO NOT THINK ABOUT IT. INSTEAD GO FOR XPERIA U(UPGRADED TO ICE-CREAM SANDWICH) OR HTC DESIRE V(SEXY LOOKS)."
Xperia J,2,"SONY HAS LAUNCHED A GOOD LOOKING 4"" SCREEN MOBILE BUT HAS COMPROMISED ON THE VERY BASIC FEATURE OF TELEPHONIC CONVERSATION. THE VOICE SUDDENLY GOES OFF WHILE TALKING AT MANY TIMES. HOPE THIS FEEDBACK CAN BE READ BY SONY SO THAT THEY CAN WORK ON THIS FEEDBACK."
Xperia J,2,"THE PHONE IS AN EXPENSE FOR 16.5 K. THERE ARE MANY BETTER PHONE IN THIS SEGMENT THE PRESENT COST IS AROUND 14. THE LOOK IS GREAT AND THE BATTERY BACKUP IS BEST FOR THE FEATURES ON PAPER. BUT IT LAGS BEHIND IN MOST OF THE DEPARTMENTS APART FROM BATTERY, ONLY SCREEN SIZE IS GOOD FOR BROWSING AND WATCHING VIDEOS THE PROCESSOR IS OF NO USE THE PHONE LAGS IN BASIC OPERATIONS. THE CAMERA IS WORST 5 MPIXELS I HAVE SEEN. THERE IS ENORMOUS FRAMES DELAY IN LOW GRAPHIC GAMES AND WILL NOT GO TO  GRAPHICAL GAMES AS THEY DON'T RUN . ONLY GOOD FOR PPL WHO USE BASIC STUFFS."
Xperia J,2,"THIS PHONE LOOKS AWESOME , SPECIALLY THE REAR PANEL
      
      
      AND THE DISPLAY COLOURS ARE AWESOME .
      
      
      BUT EVERYTHING IS IN VAIN WHEN U TRY TO PLAY EVEN SOME GENERAL GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN, THE PHONE LAGS AND RUINS YOUR ANDROID EXPERIENCE
      
      
      I HAVE USED IT FOR 5 MONTHS AND FEEL LIKE FOOLED BY BRAND IMAGE OF SONY"
Xperia J,2,"WE HAVE MANY OPTIONS AT THIS RANGE IF U SEE AKSHAT GUPTHA OR OTHERS THEY SIMPLY SAW THE OVER VIEW AT THIS RANGE BUT U CAN GET SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVAMCE OR SONY XPERIA U OR SONY XPERIA SOLA ...(COMPARING SPECS)......COMING TO S ADVANCE AND XPERIA U AND SOLA WE HAVE DUAL CORE PROCESSORS IN THREE PHONES WHEREAS J HAS ONLY SINGLE CORE WITH ARM A5 ARCHITECTURE BUT U CAN GET A7 ARCHITECTURE AT SAME PRICE AND COMING TO RAM S ADVANCE HAS 768 AND XPERIA U J AND SOLA HAS 512 MB THEN COMING TO GPU ADRENO 200 IS THE MIN LEVEL GPU AND U CANT AFFORD 15K FOR IT WE CAN GET MALI 400MP GPU (S2 ANS S3 GPU BUT CORES IN GPU CAN BE DIFFERENT ) IN ALL THE THREE PHONE I MEAN S ADVANCE ,U AND SOLA PERSONALLY I HAVE USED SOLA AND U THEY ARE POWERULL PHONES , FINALLY HERE COMES THE INTEL XOLO X 900 AT THE SAME PRICE WITH 512 MB RAM BUT PROCESSOR IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO BENCHMARK RESULTS THAT INTEL 1.6 GHZ PROCESSOR PERFORMS MORE POWERFUL THAN THESE THREE DUAL CORE PROCESSORS AND GPU ITS ENOUGH FOR A PHONE WITH INTEL CHIPSET . THEN FINALLY IF U WANNA GO FOR A BRAND THEN CHOOSE SAMSUNG(COMPARING ALL SPECS WITH SONY) BECAUSE X900 IS FROM LAVA
      
      (CHIPSET INTEL) AND IF U WANT TO HAVE A BIG PHONE GO FOR S ADVANCE OR X900(ALSO HAS A 8MP CAMERA) IF U PURELY WANT PERFORMANCE U CAN GO FOR S ADVANCE (INCLUDING BRAND) BUT DONT GO FOR J ITS WORST AT THAT PRICE SEE XPERIA E U WILL ALL THE SPECS OF J (EXCLUDING EXTERNAL) .....MY DECISION IS GO FOR S ADVANCE......."
Xperia J,2,"XPERIA J IS MY FIRST SMART PHONE. INITIALLY I WAS EXCITED ABOUT IT BUT WHEN I STARTED USING IT, I FELT THAT I WASTED MY MONEY. THE PHONE IS VERY SLOW HAVING 512MB RAM THAT IS DISGUSTING. EVEN AFTER UPGRADING TO JELLY BEAN THIS PHONE BECAME WORSE. IT GETS HEATED, SLOW AND HANGS A LOT.
      
      
      I WOULD SUGGEST SONY THAT PLEASE DO NOT LAUNCH SUCH SHITTY PHONES. AS FAR AS I KNOW, I WILL NEVER BUY A SONY PHONE IN FUTURE. THANKS TO SONY FOR THIS :("
Xperia J,1,"1. SONY XPERIA J THIS MOBILE IS NOT IMPRES.
      
      2.720P VIDEOS NOT WORK IN THIS MOBILE. CAMERA PHOTOGRAPHS IS NOT GOOD,TEMPLERUN GAME VERY SLOW WORKING, NO BRAVIA ENGINE. THE DISPLAY IS GOOD AND SO ARE ITS OTHER FEATURES LIKE THE MUSIC PLAYER.
      
      3. THE XPERIA J FEATURES A 4-INCH LCD OF FWVGA RESOLUTION (854 X 480 PIXELS), AND PIXEL DENSITY OF 245PPI. IT'S NOT A REALITY DISPLAY THOUGH, WHICH MEANS THAT IT COMES WITHOUT THE MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE. THAT MAY BE A SOFTWARE TWEAK BUT IT HAS ITS IMPACT ON PHOTO BROWSING AND VIDEO WATCHING.AUTO BRIGHTNESS IS NOT AVAILABLE.
      
      4. THE CPU PERFORMANCE IS QUITE POOR. THAT ALSO RESULTS IN A RATHER CHOPPY UI NAVIGATION, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE WORST THING ABOUT THE XPERIA J. THE XPERIA J CPU DOES BETTER THAN LOWER-CLOCKED CORTEX-A5 DESIGNS, IF THAT'S ANY CONSOLATION.
      
      5. WELL...ITS GUD ...BT UNABLE TO PLAY HD VIDEOS...OTHRWISE SMWAT RESEMBLES GALAXY S DUOS
      
      6.THIS PHONE DOES'NT TAKE 720P VIDEOS AND HAS A PROBLEM WHEN PLAYING 720 VIDEOS."
Xperia J,1,CAN'T U PEOPLE SEE THAT XPERIA J USES CORTEX A5 CHIPSET !!?? AND STILL U SIMPLY BUY IT ? GO FOR GALAXY S ADV INSTEAD OF THIS OR TRY THE LG L9 REALLY GR8 PHONE!!! CORTEX A5 IS OUTDATED RIGHT NOW IT'S THE GENERATION OF EITHER CORTEX A9 OR. A15
Xperia J,1,DEAR ALL I HAD BOUGHT AN XPERIA J ON 28 TH FEB 2013.I GO FOR IT BECAUSE OF BRAND SONY  BUT WHEN I STARTED USING THE PHONE I FIND MANY PROBLEM LIKE SLUGGISH TOUCH SENSITIVITY .VERY SLOW EVEN IT HANGS SEVERAL TIMES .AFTER USING 10 DAYS VERTICAL LINES COMES ON THE DISPLAY.SO I WENT TO SONY SERVICE CENTER THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN ELECTRONIC GADGETS.BUT I WAS USING GALAXY Y FOR LAST 1.1/2 YEARS EVEN IT FELL DOWN SEVERAL TIMES FROM MY HAND I DIDNT FIND SUCH PROBLEM .SONY TOTALLY LOSS OF MONEY .I FEEL EMBARRASSED.I WROTE BECAUSE I FELT THE TRAGEDY PLEASE DECIDE BEFORE YOU BUY. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF SOME ONE FACED SUCH TYPE OF PROBLEM BEFORE OR NOT.
Xperia J,1,DEAR READERS....HONESTLY SPEAKING IT IS A WORST PHONE. I BOUGHT IT A MONTH AGO &AMP; REPENTING..IT HANGS A LOT &AMP; CAMERA QUALITY IS POOR. IT HEATS UP FREQUENTLY....BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD.. I NEVER EXPECTED SUCH A POOR PERFORMER FROM SONY THE JAPANESE GIANT.... SONY PLS ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM....
Xperia J,1,"HI ALL,
      
      
      THE PHONE IS VERY GOOD LOOKING AND FUNCTION WISE BUT THERE IS HANG PROBLEM THAT MAY RESOLVE BUT IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN MUSIC DON'T EVER BUY J. MUSIC WISE THIS IS THE WORTHLESS THAT I HAVE EVER USED.
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING SONY PHONES FROM 6-7 YEARS W710I/AND OTHER W SERIES THE PREVIOUS PHONE I WAS USING SONY XPERIA U (IT WAS AWESOME IN EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY IN MUSIC). I JUST LOST MY PHONE LAST MONTH AND I BUY J THAT IS MORE ADVANCE FROM U ....BUT IT IS PATHETIC....
      
      IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY J JUST CHECK IT ONCE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NEVER WISH TO BUY J"
Xperia J,1,"HI FRIENDS,
      
      
      I BOUGHT ONE SONY XPERIA U JUST ONE MONTH BACK ,IT'S ALMOST SIMILAR(EXCEPT 32GB EXPANDABLE) TO XPERIA J,&AMP; I M SHOCKED HOW SONY IS GIVING SUCH PHONES WITH ONLY 512MB MEMORY.JUST FEW DAYS BACK I HAVE UPGRADED MY PHONE TO ICS 4.0,NOW MY PHONE IS LIKE NO USE. IT HANGS VERY FREQUENTLY,SOME TIMES I AM GETTING ALERT TONE FOR MESSAGE &AMP; MAIL,SOME TIMES NOT,EVERY DAY YOU HAVE TO REBOOT ONCE.&AMP; THERE ARE MANY MORE ISSUES, I SPOKE/MAIL TO SONY TECH SUPPORT &AMP; THEY ARE TELLING YOU CAN NOT DOWNGRADE TO GINGERBREAD(GINGERBREAD IS BETTER THEN ICS IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE).SO GUYS I WOULD SUGGEST PLEASE DO NOT GO WITH SUCH CONFIGURATION(LIKE MEMOEY 512MB ETC)BUT SONY IS GOOD IN PICTURE CLARITY,CAMERA ETC NOT IN PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      THINK BEFORE YOU BUY SOMETHING"
Xperia J,1,"I BOUGHT SONY XPERIA-J IN 14TH JAN. FROM FLIPKART. UNDOUBTEDLY FLIPKART'S SERVICE IS EXCELENT.
      
      I HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THIS MOBILE PHONE. WHEN I WANT TO RECEIVE INCOMING CALLS NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE CALL DUE TO PHONE'S TOUCH IS NOT RESPONDING. IT IS PERFECTLY STUCK, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT WATCHING THAT WHO IS CALLING. IT IS VERY IRRITATING. IT HANGS ANY TIME WHILE GETTING INCOMING CALLS AND WHEN I WANT TO UNLOCK IT TOUCH DOES NOT RESPOND.
      
      I HAVE NOT GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS MOBILE SET. I THINK IT WAS MY MISTAKE TO CHOOSE SONY XPERIA-J."
Xperia J,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ABOUT 5 MONTHS AGO.
      
      I AM A MUSIC LOVER AND BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR THE-MUCH TALKED ABOUT- ""SOUND QUALITY"" OF SONY AND THERE IS ONLY ONE WORD I CAN SAY ABOUT IT- PATHETIC, AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO THIS PHONE.
      
      THE SOUND IN THE HEADPHONES IS INCREDIBLY LOW AND ALL YOU CAN LISTEN TO IS OUTSIDE SOUND.BUT.....THERE IS ALSO A GOOD SIDE TO THIS- NOW I DONT HAVE TO TAKE MY EARPHONES OUT TO KNOW IF MY MOM IS CALLING ME, I CAN SIMPLY LISTEN TO HER WHILE LISTENING TO MY SONGS, AT FULL VOLUME :D
      
      AT FIRST, THE SONY GUYS SUGGESTED ME HELPLESS SOLUTIONS LIKE ALTERING EQUILISER, ABOUT WHICH, FRANKLY, EVEN CHILDREN KNOW THESE DAYS.
      
      
      BY NOW, I HAVE VISITED TO ALMOST ALL THE SERVICE CENTRES ACROSS MUMBAI AND THE ONLY THING THEY SAY TO EACH AND EVERY PROBLEM IS, ""SIR SOFTWARE UPDATE KARNA PADEGA"" WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS ALREADY UP TO DATE.
      
      
      APART FROM THIS, WHEN YOU TELL THEM ABOUT THE BAD SOUND QUALITY THEY STRAIGHT AWAY TELL YOU,""MUSIC K LIYE AAPNE YEH PHONE KYU LIYA?"" LEAVING ME SPEECHLESS.
      
      NOT ONLY THE QUALITY OF SOUND, YOU CANNOT LISTEN TO A SINGLE WORD OF THE SONG IF U R DOING ANYTHING ELSE IN THE BACKGROUND(FOR EG.BROWSING), BECAUSE OF THE SUPER IRRITATING LAG IN MUSIC.
      
      
      THE ONLY THING GOOD ABT THIS PHONE IS THE PICTURE QUALITY.THE COLORS ARE VERY BRIGHT AND APPEALING, BUT THATS IT.
      
      
      EACH AND EVERY GAME LAGS TERRIBLY, TOTALLY RUINING YOUR GAMING EXPERIENCE.EVEN THE TOUCH SCREEN SUDDENLY BECOMES UNRESPONSIVE WHILE PLAYING GAMES.
      
      
      ALL AND ALL, IF U THINK U R TOO HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE AND NEED A BIT OF FRUSTRATION, THEN THIS PHONE IS CUSTOM BUILT FOR PEOPLE LIKE U...:P -SERIOUSLY-"
Xperia J,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE BUT AFTER BUYING THIS IT IS GIVING ME MANY PROBLEMS.I HAVE SUBMITTED 3 TIMES IN SERVICE CENTER, BUT STILL IT NOT CURE. IT'S SPEAKERS ARE NOT WORKING WELL. THEY CHANGE 4 TO 5 PARTS OF MY MOBILE WHILE IN SERVICE CENTER!!!!"
Xperia J,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN DECEMBER, AND BY FEBRUARY THE THE MIC AND THE SPEAKER STOPPED WORKING, SO MAKING CALLS WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY. SOON THE EARPHONES STOPPED WORKING TOO. I TOOK IT TO THE SERVICE CENTRE AND IT'S BEEN OVER 10 DAYS TODAY AND ALL THEY ARE SAYING TO ME IS THAT THE PCB HAS TO BE CHANGED, WHICH THEY HAVE ORDERED FROM SOME UNKNOWN REGION! SO THE PCB IS IN TRANSIT AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE DAYS THEY LL TAKE. SONY HAS THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. THE SERVICE CENTRE PEOPLE ARE VERY RUDE AND EVEN IF YOU WRITE TO SONY, THERE IS NO RESPONSE (ALTHOUGH YOU'LL RECEIVE AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE SAYING THAT A CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE WILL GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU).
      
      
      MY VERDICT IS, PLEASE DO NOT BUY A SONY PHONE. THEIR QUALITY AND SERVICE ARE BOTH SUBSTANDARD.
      
      
      PS: I DID NOT EVEN DROP MY PHONE ONCE, WHICH MEANS THERE WAS A TECHNICAL GLITCH IN MY PHONE FROM THE BEGINNING."
Xperia J,1,"I BOUGHT XPERIA J 3 MONTHS BACK AND I HAVE SOME ISSUE OR THE OTHER. IT HANGS ANY TIME,
      
      I HAVE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE MANY TIMES AND GOT INSULTED IF IT IS A REALY PHONE OR A DUMMY SET. HANGS HANGS HANGS, AND I FOUND IT IN MORE THAN 3 PHONES IN MY CIRCLE."
Xperia J,1,"I BOUGHT XPERIA J 6 MONTHS BACK, BUT I REGRET MY DECISION. THIS PHONE REALLY SUCKS, IT HANGS A LOT, NOT UP-TO THE MARK OF 17 K AT THAT PRICE WHICH I BOUGHT. IN FACT SAMSUNG ACE IS MUCH BETTER ND CHEAPER THEN THIS. I WOULD NOT DEFINITELY RECOMMEND SOME 1 TO BUY SONY XPERIAJ."
Xperia J,1,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE LAST MONTH AND FROM THAT POINT IT HANGS A LOT
      
      DESPITE I GAVE IT TO THE SONY CENTRE TWICE FOR REPAIR AND STILL THE PROBLEM PERSISTS.
      
      PLZ DNT BUY THIS PHONE AS THIS MODEL HAS A PROBLEM FROM THE MANUFACTURING ITSELF
      
      
      THOUGH FLIPKART PROVIDES YOU WITH A GREAT SERVICE AND BUY ANYTHING FROM HERE BUT NOT THIS PHONE"
Xperia J,1,"I PURCHASED THE PHONE FROM SONY CENTER, BELOW IS THE REVIEW.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1. CURVY SHAPE MAKES IT APPEAR THIN.
      
      2. GOOD QUALITY CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL USED.
      
      3. UPGRADE TO JELLY BEAN 4.1 IS AVAILABLE OUT OF THE BOX FROM SONY'S WEBSITE.
      
      4. CHOICE OF DIFFERENT COLOUR THEMES AVAILABLE FOR THE SONY'S INTERFACE.
      
      5. SMOOTH UI AND NO CHOPPINESS FELT WHILE USING THE PHONE.
      
      6. PHONE COMES WITH A MICRO SIM TO NORMAL SIM ADAPTER WHICH MEANS IT CAN SUPPORT BOTH.
      
      7. MEMORY SPACE IS GOOD FOR THE USER APPS TO BE INSTALLED.
      
      8. WALL CHARGER HAS A USB ATTACHMENT WHICH MAKES IT SMALL AND LESS CUMBERSOME.
      
      9. WALKMAN APPLICATION MAKES MUSIC LISTENING A JOY WITH FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE EQUALIZER.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      1. OUT OF THE BOX HEADSET IS NOT WORTH PAYING EXTRA, INSTEAD SONY CAN REDUCE THE PRICE OF THE PHONE.
      
      2. DUAL CORE MISSING, ALTHOUGH AN AVERAGE USER WILL NEVER FEEL THE NEED OF A DUAL CORE BUT STILL NOKIA 620 WHICH IS IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE IS GIVING A DUAL CORE TO THE USER.
      
      3. NO INTERCHANGEABLE BACK COVERS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET FROM SONY.
      
      4. INTERNAL MEMORY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 8 GB INSTEAD OF 2 GB."
Xperia J,1,"I REGRET BUYING SONY EXPERIA. IT HAS HARDLY ANY BATTERY LIFE. EVEN IF IT IS NOT USED, BATTERY LASTS ONLY FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND IF IN USE ONE HAS TO KEEP IT PLUGGED LEST IT WENT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION. CAMERA IS PATHETIC, TAKES ITS SWEET TIME TO CLICK, ONLY OK FOR STILL OBJECTS. IN CASE YOU WANT TO CAPTURE A MOMENT, ALL THAT YOU WILL GET IS A POST EVENT PHOTO AND NOT A GOOD ONE AT THAT. SILENT MODE DOESN'T VIBRATE. FORWARDING A BUSINESS CARD IS CUMBERSOME. BOUGHT IT FROM FLIPCART READING THE REVIEWS, BUT ITS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING,  ONLY A GOOD TOY TO PLAY TEMPLE RUN/RUNNER.OVERALL A BAD PRODUCT."
Xperia J,1,IT HANGS...STUCKS..NT HVING D MEMORY FOR STORAGE OF MORE APPS...SAMSUNG S DUOS Z BST COMPARE TO DIS N IN PRIZE TOO...THOUGH ADRENO GRAPHIC PROCESSOR Z GIVEN NO USE OF IT....BETTER BUY SAMSUNG S DUOS FOR GOOD QUALITY
Xperia J,1,"ITS HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE SONY BRAND NOW PRODUCES ECONOMICAL PHONES WITH MUCH BETTER BATTERY BACKUP, WHICH 2 FACTORS WERE MISSING BEFORE.......
      
      
      KUDOS TO SONY FOR MAKING THIS KIND F FONES
      
      
      2 PROBLEM THAT STILL PERSIST ON THIS FONE ARE
      
      -ONLY 2 POINT MULTI TOUCH
      
      -ADRENO 200 GPU

Xperia J,1,"IVE PURCHASED XPERIA J N I FEEL TERRIBLY SORRY. THE INTERFACE IS USELESS. THE PHONE HANGS A LOT. THE PHONE'S TOUCH IS NOT IN OUR CONTROL. CALL QUALITY IS AVERAGE. WORTHLESS WALKMAN.

Xperia J,1,"MY KIND ADVICE DON'T BUY THIS MOBILE, BECAUSE I USING THIS DAM MOBILE....
      
      
      * PERFORMANCE IS VERY LOW..
      
      * TOUCH SCREEN LACKS
      
      * SOUND QUALITY IS LOW

Xperia J,1,"PROS:
      
      - LOOKS VERY GOOD
      
      - LIGHTWEIGHT
      
      
      CONS (FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE):
      
      - WHEN RECHARGING TOTALLY UNUSABLE - SCREEN BECOMES CRAZY, FREEZES AND GOES TOTALLY AWKWARD. TOUCH IS FREQUENTLY NOT PRECISE.
      
      - LAGS HORRIBLY WHEN CONNECTED TO WIFI (MEASURED EXACTLY 18 SECS JUST TO OPEN TEXT INBOX, APPS ARE TAKING PAINFULLY LONG TO START)
      
      - PHONE MEMORY TO SMALL. ONLY SMALL AMOUNT OF APPS CAN BE INSTALLED AND THEN YOU'RE FACED WITH INABILITY TO DOWNLOAD BECAUSE THERE'S SIMPLY ""NO SPACE ON THE PHONE"".
      
      - PHONEBOOK IS EXTREMELY SLOW AND TAKES FOREVER TO FIND A CONTACT.
      
      - NO DIRECT DIAL BY NAME, ONLY NUMBER.
      
      - TYPING IS ANNOYINGLY SLOW AND IMPRECISE.
      
      
      THINKING ON EXCHANGING IT AFTER ONLY A MONTH USE... UTTERLY BAD EXPERIENCE. BAD!"

      ONE OF WORST PHONES OF RECENT TIMES"
Xperia J,1,"THIS MOBILE IS THE WORST MOBILE I HAVE EVER SEEN.YOU CAN'T PLAY GAMES ON IT AS IT HAS ADRENO 200.BIG SCREEN REQUIRE MORE PROCESSING POWER WHILE PLAYING AND IT HAS A SINGLE CORE 1GHZ PROCESSOR.THIS MOBILE IS SUFFICE FOR COMMON BASIC USE NOT ABOVE THAT.
      
      IT WOULD BE BETTER IF SONY LAUNCHED XPERIA U NEW VERSION WITH SD CARD SUPPORT INSTEAD OF FLOPSHOW XPERIA J.
      
      XPERIA 2011 LINEUP IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS MOBILE.AND IF SOMEONE BUYING IT FOR A BIG SCREEN ,LED NOTIFICATION AND LATEST OS,THEN BETTER BUY MICROMAX CANVAS 2 OR A90S.THEY ARE MUCH BETTER WITH BETTER SPECS.
      
      
      IF YOU WANT SONY MOBILE THEN CONSIDER XPERIA U OR XPERIA S(UNDER 22K BUDGET) .REST SONY MOBILES IN THAT RANGE ARE NOT THAT GREAT."

      THANK YOU"
Xperia P,5,"AT THE TIME OF PURCHASING THIS PHONE I TOOK SOME TIME CHECKING OUT OTHER PHONES AND BRANDS BUT DIDN'T FOUND ANY TO MY SATISFACTION BUT THIS PHONE WAS THE ONE FOR ME. RECEIVED IT ON THE 4RTH DAY OF MY ORDER 4 DAYS BEFORE THE ACTUAL DATE. AT ITS BEST FLIPKART'S SERVICE AND THE QUALITY OF SONY XPERIA HAD IT FOR TWO DAYS NOW HERE ARE MY REVIEWS.
      
      PROS :
      
      1) GREAT DISPLAY EXTRA BRIGHT COMPARED WITH A LOT OF OTHER PHONES BUT NO COMPETITION AT ALL.
      
      2) SO CALLED ""ICS"" UPDATE IS HERE TOO AND BELIEVE ME ITS AWESOME. AFTER ALL ITS GOOGLE.
      
      3) MEMORY IS 13 GB BUT NO REGRETS ENOUGH FOR ME I GUESS BUT U CAN ADD AN OTG(ONTHEGO) CABLE TO ATTACH PENDRIVE AND ALL.
      
      4) PROCESSOR IS BRILLIANT NO LAG AT ALL EVEN ON THE HIGH END GAMES SUPPORTED BY POWERFUL GPU.
      
      5) VIDEO RECORDING IS 1080P AND IMAGE QUALITY INCLUDING THE FLASH IS GREAT OVERALL GIVES A GOOD CRISP IMAGE.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      1) MAJOR ISSUE IS BATTERY LIFE I HAVE TO KILL APPS AND MINIMIZE THE BRIGHTNESS SO AS TOO KEEP THE BATTERY GOING. 1300MAH IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THIS GIANT FUELED UP I GUESS THIS THE MAJOR LAG.
      
      2) VIDEO RECORDING IS NOT UP TO THE MARK.
      
      3) THE QUALITY OF EARPHONES IS NOT UPTO THE ""SONY"" MARK THERE'S LOT OF UNWANTED TREBLE WHEN TUNED UP FULL VOLUME.

Xperia P,5,"DELIVERED THE PRODUCT IN 2 DAYS(DELHI TO BANGALORE). MOST TRUSTED SELLER.
      
      
      A PREMIUM PHONE MADE OF ALUMINUM UNIBODY WITH WHITE MAGIC AND TOUCH SENSITIVE WHITE STRIP.
      
      
      NO ONE WOULD REGRET HAVING SUCH A WONDERFUL SMARTPHONE."
Xperia P,5,"FIRST OF ALL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE BATTERY BACKUP. NO DOUBT IT IS NOT THE BEST WITH BACKUP. BUT THE PHONE CHARGES IN AN HOUR FROM ANY PHONE'S CHARGER(ARC S TAKES ABOUT 2HOURS). PLUS THE STANDBY IS SUPERB. NO ISSUES FOR ME.
      
      THIS PHONE COMES WITH EARPHONES SIMILAR TO XPERIA SOLA AND THEY ARE BRILLIANT.
      
      THE SCREEN IS JUST GORGEOUS WITH 900+ NITS OF BRIGHTNESS.
      
      SOLID FORM FACTOR, FEELS SO SOLID.
      
      CAMERA KEY WORKS WELL UNLIKE XPERIA U AND SOLA THAT HAVE TACKY CAMERA KEY.
      
      WOULD RATE CAMERA 4/5, NOT THE BEST BUT DOES WELL IN ALL CONDITIONS.
      
      WHEN IT COMES TO GAMING I'VE BEEN PLAYING SHADOW GUN A GAME OF 660MBS AND EVEN GAMES LIKE GTA VICE CITY WORTH 1.5GB IS CLAIMED TO WORK FLAWLESSLY.
      
      LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST SONY HAS ANNOUNCED JELLY BEAN UPDATE BY MARCH.
      
      WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED?"
Xperia P,5,"FIRST THE SCREEN
      
      -272 PPI MORE THAN HTC SENSATION XE
      
      -WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY
      
      EVERY DISPLAY HAS A RED-GREEN-BLUE PIXEL THAT IS RGB
      
      BUT IN XPERIA P RED-GREEN-BLUE-WHITE RGBW
      
      Y DID THEY ADD A WHITE PIXEL ? TO INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS !
      
      IT HAS  THE BRIGHTEST MOBILE SCREEN IN THE WORLD !
      
      -BRAVIA ENGINE  PROVIDES THE EXACT COLOR OF THE PICTURE  WHEREAS SAMSUNG'S GALAXY S2 DOESN'T PROVIDE THE EXACT COLOR
      
      -PROCESSOR 1 GHZ DUAL CORE IT IS LOW FR 20K BUT MALI 400 IS A GOOD GPU  SO DERS NT MUCH PRESSURE ON PROCESSOR
      
      -CAM NO ONE CAN BEAT SONY IN MOBILE CAM EXMOR SENSOR REALLY I LOVED IT THE LENS HAS A F2.4 APERTURE SO TATS VERY MUCH ENOUGH FR LOW LIGHT
      
      DESIGN - ALUMINIUM BODY ... FEELS GRIPPY! AD IS EASY TO HOLD THE POWER OR LOCK BUTTON IS ON THE SIDE WHICH IS MORE COMFORTABLE .THE BODY IS RIGID IT HAS GOT A COULPE OF AWARDS FR IT
      
      SPEAKERS - ARE ON THE SIDE WHICH DOESNT BLOCK EM WHILE HOLDING THE PHONE ... WALKMAN INSPIRED XLOUD WORKS PERFECTLY
      
      BATTERY - ON THE FACE OF HATERS UNDERSTAND THE DISPLAY EATS MUCH AS BRAVIA ENGINE IS DER BT NT LIKE THE OLD ONES
      
      IT LASTED FR 6 HOURS FR ME (GAMING- MAXPAYNE,MOSTWANTED 2012)WIFI -1HR 3G 2HR
      
      HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPED YALL:)"
Xperia P,5,"FIRST, FOR THOSE WHO THINK THAT THE BATTERY IS ENOUGH JUST BECAUSE THERE IS WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT NOT, PROFESSIONAL REVIEWS HAVE SAID IT HAS MEDIOCRE BATTERY LIFE, SO STOP SAYING THE SMALL BATTERY IS FINE.
      
      OTHERWISE, THE PHONE IS GREAT, EVERYTHING IS THERE FOR THE PRICE. DUAL-CORE, MALI 400MP GPU, ENOUGH STORAGE AT 13 GB, IT'S A GOOD PHONE. DISPLAY IS SHARP THANKS TO THE HIGH RESOLUTION.
      
      GREAT PHONE, SONY IS DOING GREAT WITH THESE LOW COST XPERIA PHONES."
Xperia P,5,"FOR NOW I HAVE BEEN USING THE PHONE FOR THE LAST ONE MONTH LET ME START WITH THE
      
      PROS:
      
      BRILLIANT DISPLAY
      
      BATTERY LIFE WAS DECENT(OVER FULLCHARGING I AM GETTING IT FOR 1.5 DAYS)
      
      CAM QUALITY AND VIDEO RECORDING WAS TOO GUD.
      
      PLAYING BOTH 780P AND 1080P EFFICIENTLY.
      
      THE MOST IMPORTANT THING SONY UI WAS DAMN GUD COMPARE TO THE OTHER PHONES PRICED IN THIS RANGE.
      
      MUSIC QUALITY WAS TOO GUD(AS THEY WERE ALWAYS THE BEST)
      
      OVERALL THE PERFORMANCE WAS GUD.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      AS OF NOW PHONE GOT HANGED ONCE.(INFACT THIS IS HAPPENING WITH EVERY ANDROID PHONE)
      
      NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY USER CAN ACCESS UPTO 13 GB(CONSIDERING PHONE MEMORY TOO)
      
      
      EVER SINCE THE PHONE WAS OUT EVERYBODY STARTED WORRYING OUT THE ICS UPDATE AND BATTERY LIFE.
      
      
      NOW ITS OFFICIAL XPERIA P ICS UPDATE TO DROP IN EARLY AUGUST.
      
      
      LET ME TELL YOU ONE MORE THING BATTERY LIFE WAS NOT BAD IN FACT FOR A PERSON STAYING IN INDIA(WHO HARDLY USES 3G).
      
      EVERYDAY I HAVE BEEN USING INTERNET 3 TO 4 HRS(2G)
      
      LISTENING TO MUSIC(6 TO 7 HRS)
      
      PLAYING GAMES(AROUND 2.5 TO 3 HRS)
      
      STILL I LEFT OUT WITH HALF OF THE CHARGING AT TIMES AFTER USING IT AS ABOVE.
      
      ONCE ICS UPDATE ROLLS OUT I DONT THINK BATTERY LIFE WAS A BIG PROBLEM.
      
      CONCLUSION: USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE,BRILLIANT DISPLAY,GOOD MUSIC  AND CAM QUALITY MAKE THIS PHONE UNIQUE GO FOR IT!!!"
Xperia P,5,"GOT THIS PHONE LAST FRIDAY, HAVE A REALLY GOOD FEELING OWNING IT, THE MAIN DOWNSIDE OF THIS PHONE IS ITS BATTERY LIFE, FOR FIRST 3 DAYS AFTER CHARGING TO FULL THE BATTERY WAS DRAINING IN 6-7 HOURS WITH MODERATE USE (LIMITED CALL, MODERATE INTERNET AND GAMEPLAY), WAS AGHAST WITH THE BATTERY, THEN STOPPED FEW SERVICES AND GOT A REASONABLE PERFORMORMANCE BOOST, OTHERWISE .... A GREAT MIDRANGE PHONE... BTW REATIL SHOPS ARE GIVING GOOD DISCOUNTS ."
Xperia P,5,"GREAT DESIGN. TOTALLY WORTH FOR MONEY. FEELS LIKE A JEWEL IN MY HAND.
      
      I ALSO GOT TWO NFC TAGS WHICH I FOUND VERY USEFUL TO TRIGGER THE ACTIVITIES I REQUIRE.
      
      THE SCREEH HAS A SCREENGUARD OUT OF THE BOX. IT WILL ONLY SUPPORT MICRO SIM CARD.
      
      ANYONE CAN CUT AND USE THE CURRENT NORMAL SIM CARD. THE LOWER PANEL IS BIT PLASTIC WHICH CAN BE PULLED TO REMOVED FROM THE MAIN UNIT.
      
      OVERALL A BEST VALUE PRODUCT FROM SONY."
Xperia P,5,"GREAT MOBILE FROM SONY!
      
      LOOK IS AWESOME.
      
      FEELS GREAT IN HAND.
      
      ALUMINUM BODY IS PERFECT.
      
      16GB OR INTERNAL WITH 13GB USER AVAILABLE IS JUST MORE THAN ENOUGH.
      
      THE 8MP CAMERA CLICKS AWESOME PICTURES.
      
      VIDEO RECORDING IS FULL HD 1080P AT 29FPS AND THE VIDEO CLARITY IS STUNNING.
      
      BATTERY IS A BIT TURNOFF AS CHARGE DOESN'T LAST LONG IF YOU USE DATA OR WIFI!
      
      BUT BELIEVE ME U WILL NEVER FIND ANY OTHER DEVICE WHICH CHARGES FAST. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT SONY PUT INTO IT BUT WITH A HOUR OF CHARGE IT REACHES AROUND 90% FROM 10%.
      
      ICS IS AWESOME ON THIS PHONE AND WORKS SMOOTH WITH OUT A GLITCH. NEVER WORRY WHAT TO DO WHEN THE PHONE HANGS AS BATTERY IS NON REMOVABLE, TRUST ME I USED IT FOR 3 MONTHS AND IT DID NOT HANG ONCE.
      
      EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE XPERIA P"
Xperia P,5,"HI ,
      
      I AM ASHISH MEHTA, FROM DELHI, USING SONY XPERIA P FROM LAST TWO MONTHS. AFTER USING IT FOR 2 MONTHS, I THOUGHT TO REVIEW THE SAME ON THE FLIPKART AS I AM IN GOOD POSITION TO RATE THIS PRODUCT. I DIDN'T PURCHASED IT FROM FLIPKART, BUT I AM ALWAYS A FAN OF FLIPKART SERVICE..
      
      
      I BIFURCATED THE FEATURES IN TO DIFFERENT AREAS:
      
      
      A). LOOKS AND BUILD : THE LOOK IS ULTIMATE YET ELEGANT.. VERY MUCH DIFFERENT TO ONGOING SAMSUNG PLASTIC CRAP!! MADE OF ALUMINIUM UNIBODY. VERY MUCH COMFORTABLE TO HOLD IT..4 INCH OF DISPLAY IS ENOUGH OTHERWISE THERE IS DIFFICULT TO HOLD ANY PHONE.
      
      
      B) PERFORMANCE : BELIEVE ME, I HAVEN'T FEEL ANY LAG AND HANGING PROBLEM YET IN THIS PHONE...VERY MUCH SMOOTH..THE INTERFERENCE IS VERY MUCH SMOOTH..WITH 1 GHZ PROCESSOR AND 1 GB OF RAM, THE PHONE NEVER LET U SLOW.. I AM AMAZED TO SEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PHONE
      
      
      C). STORAGE: IT COMES WITH INTERNAL STORAGE OF 16 GB, NO OPTION FOR ENHANCEMENT OF STORAGE. BUT 13 GB FOR USER IS ENOUGH FOR ANYONE IF YOU DNT WANT TO STORE LOTS OF VIDEOS. FULL HD VIDEO WILL COVER LOTS OF SPACE.
      
      
      D). MUSIC: SONY ALWAYS KNOWS FOR IT AUDIO DEVICE..WALKMAN PLAYER IS ULTIMATE..MUSIC QUALITY IS QUITE IMPRESSIVE, THE HEADPHONE PROVIDED WITH IT CREATES DECENT BASS EFFECT.
      
      WALKMAN PLAYER IS AHEAD OF ALL THE PLAYER INSTALLED IN SAMSUNG AND HTC...
      
      
      THERE IS LOTS OF FEATURE FOR THE USER.
      
      
      TRACK ID APPLICATION IS IMPRESSIVE...YOU CAN TRACK EVERY TRACK IN THIS APPLICATION..
      
      
      E).  CAMERA : XPERIA P COMES WITH 8 MP.. THOUGH SONY KNOWN FOR ITS QUALITY IN CAMERA,  BUT THIS PHONE DOESNT IMPRESSED ME. WITH THE RANGE OF AROUND 23 K , THE CAMERA IS NOT UPTO MARK
      
      GUYS, DNT LOOK FOR MEGAPIXEL IN CAMERA...THE QUALITY OF PICS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MEGAPIXEL , IT ONLY HELP WHEN U WANT TO TAKE THE PRINTS OF THE PICTURES.
      
      
      F). INTERFERANCE : TIMESCAPE INTERFERENCE IS AWESOME.  GRAPHIC QUALITY...BIG RESOLUTION AND WHITE MAGIC TECHNOGLOGY MAKES IT IN DIFFERENT LEAGUE..
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1) FANTASTIC BUILD AND LOOKS
      
      2) GOOD MUSIC
      
      3) SMOOTH FUNCTIONING
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      1) CAMERA IS GOOD BUT NOT LIKE THAT IN THE RANGE OF 23K.
      
      2)  STORAGE IS NOT EXPANDABLE BUT PERSONALLY SPEAKING 16 GB IS MUCH ENOUGH.
      
      
      GUYS!! IF YOU HAVE BUDGET OF 20 - 25 K ..DNT THINK... JUST GRAB IT AND FEEL IT."
Xperia P,5,"HI ALL
      
      I JUST BOUGHT THIS PHONE FEW HRS AGO. I WAS CHECKING ALL REVIEWS OF XPERIA MODELS ONLINE BEFORE I DECIDED. I WAS KEEN ABOUT BUYING XPERIA S DUE TO IT'S SIZE AND STORAGE. BUT I CHANGED MY MIND TO GO WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL ONE XPERIA P AS I CHECKED ALL THE MODELS IN LIVE DEMO TODAY. I CAN'T BELIEVE STILL HOW MUCH THIS ""WHITE MAGIC"" TECH STANDS OUT OF OTHER SMARTPHONES. XPERIA S TOO COULDN'T GIVE SUCH BRIGHTNESS. AM REALLY SURPISED OF IT'S PERFORMANCE TOO. BECOS I WAS HATING SONYERICSSON FOR THEIR SLAGGISH UI. BUT COMING OUT OF ERICSSON SONY PPL HAS GIVEN THEIR BEST PRODUCT EVER I HOPE. THE ONE WHO LOVES MULTIMEDIA, GAMING, HI-END DISPLAY WILL NEVER WORRY WITH THIS PHONE!
      
      
      PS: I WAS USING HTC HD7 FOR MORE THAN A YEAR COS OF IT'S QUALITY BUILD AND WONDERFUL TOUCH EXPERIENCE. BUT TODAY'S HTC PRODUCTS ARE NOT WORTH TO THE PRICE WITH CHEAP BODY BUILD. WHEN I DECIDED FOR A CHANGE SONY GAVE ME THE BEST ONE!
      
      
      | NEED TO CHECK ON BATTERY PERFORMANCE |
      
      
      PROS:
      
      UNBELIEVABLE WHITE MAGIC BRIGHTNESS!
      
      SMOOTH UI TRANSITION
      
      NICE TOUCH EXPERIENCE
      
      SOLID BUILD LIKE A GOLD CAKE!
      
      PREMIUM BODY STYLE WITH THE GLASS MATERIAL CAPACITIVE BTNS
      
      GREAT CAMERA - PHOTOS &AMP; FULL HD VIDEO RECORDING
      
      AND MORE....
      
      
      CONS
      
      LITTLE BULKY - NOT IN WEIGHT RATIO
      
      NO EXPANDABLE CARD SLOT"
Xperia P,5,"HI ALL
      
      THE BATTERY LIFE OF XPERIA P HAS BEEN POSED AS ONE OF THE MAJOR WEAKNESSES OF THIS PHONE.THE CLAIM IS QUITE TRUE IN THE ANDROID 2.3 PLATFORM.
      
      
      HERE IS  MY EXPERIENCE WITH GINGERBREAD
      
      ===========================
      
      I USED TO RECHARGE IT EVERY MORNING TO 100%
      
      THE WIFI AND AUTO SYNC WAS OFF
      
      USAGE :1 HR OF CALL+ 5-10 SMS+30 MIN OF GAMING+30 MIN SURFING+30 MIN MUSIC VIA HEADPHNE
      
      3G WAS ON BETWEEN 7AM - 11PM (I DOWNLOADED A BATTERY SAVER APP WHICH AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES IT OFF BETWEEN 11PM-7AM)
      
      BRIGHTNESS SET TO BATTERY SAVER MODE
      
      AT NIGHT 10 PM THE BATTERY WAS ABOUT 25-30% CAPACITY AND WAS IN RED ("
Xperia P,5,"HI GUYS, IM USING THIS PIECE FROM 20 DAYS IT IS WORKING VERY EFFICIENTLY... WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY IS AWESOME....AND THE BATTERY IS GETTING CHARGED WITH IN 45 MINS....ITS A GREAT ADVANTAGE...OTHER SAMSUNG PHONES WILL TAKE TIME TO CHARGE ABOUT 2 AND HALF HOURS AND GETS DISCHARGED IN 15 HRS.... BUT XPERIA WITH 45 MINS CHARGING IT IS GETTING 13 HRS ON NORMAL USAGE WITH NET AND SMALL GAMES..IF HIGH END GAMES ARE PLAYING IT IS GETTING DISCHARGED BY 7 HRS....THE MAJOR DRAWBACK IS LOUD SPEAKER QUALITY IS SO BAD.... BEING SONY PRODUCT I EXPECTED A LOT.... BUT AFTER LISTENING SONGS IN LOUD SPEAKER IM DISAPPOINTED...BUT IN EARPHONES IT IS DAMN GOOD...
      
      GUYZ ONE THING U SHOULD REMEMBER EVERY PHONE WILL HAVE SOME CONS.... BUT DIS IS THE PHONE WID LESSER CONS..."
Xperia P,5,"HI,
      
      
      I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER USING MY XP FOR 1 WEEK.
      
      
      THE DESIGN, LOOK AND FEEL OF THIS SMARTPHONE WILL DRIVE YOU NUTS. ITS SO SLEEK AND BEAUTIFUL.
      
      COMING TO ANDROID..ITS REALLY WORKING NICE. I HAVE NOT UPGRADED TO ICS YET BECAUSE I GOGGLED IT AND FOUND A LOT OF REVIEWS RELATED TO ICS ISSUES AND TRUST ME..GINGERBREAD SOLVES THE PURPOSE..
      
      CAMERA IS TRULY AMAZING..8MP IS ALMOST LIKE 13MP..
      
      FEATHER LIGHT TOUCH...
      
      
      PEOPLE WHO HAVE ISSUES WITH MEMORIES..TRUST ME..13 GB IS TOO MUCH..U CAN SAVE 10 1080P VIDEOS..I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE NEED SO MUCH MEMORY..AS IF THEY THEMSELVES WANA LIVE IN THERE.. :P
      
      
      TOUCHSCAPE UI...OH GOSH..CANT BELIEVE ITS TOO GUD TO USE..!!
      
      
      BATTERY FOR SURE U NEED TO CHARGE ONCE IN 24 HOURS AND TO MY AMAZEMENT..IT GETS DONE IN EXACTLY 50 MINS..WHICH SOUNDS GR8!!
      
      
      COMING TO GAMES..I PLAY TEMPLE RUN AND UNBLOCK CAR WITHOUT ANY LAG..SINCE I AM NOT A GAME FREAK..I BELIEVE THATS ENOUGH FOR ME..!!
      
      
      THE WIDGETS ARE REALLY AWESOME PLUS U CAN DOWNLOAD FROM ANDROID MARKET AS WELL..FREE ONES WILL SERVE YOUR PURPOSE
      
      
      1GB RAM AND 1 GHZ DUAL CORE..TRUST ME..THATS MORE THAN ENUF..I HAVE USED SG3 AND HTC ONE X..AND SONY HAS FAR BETTER ENGINE AND PROCESSOR..!!
      
      
      LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST..MUSIC QUALITY IS DECENT WHEN PLAYING WITHOUT EARPHONES (ITS NOT MUCH LOUD) BUT WITH EARPHONES U WILL GET THE BEST OF MUSIC..ALSO U CAN DOWNLOAD PRO MUSIC PLAYER FROM ANDROID MARKET ALONG WITH DSP PACK WHICH WILL SERVE YOUR PURPOSE BEYOND ENUFF!!
      
      
      ALL N ALL..I WOULD GIVE 5 STARS TO THIS AMAZING PHONE..!!
      
      
      ONLY WORD OF ADVICE...JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE AND DONT LOAD UR PHONE WITH TONS OF APPS..BECUASE THE MORE U PUT IN..THE MORE IT WILL CHANCES TO SCREW UP THINGS.. :)
      
      
      I HOPE THIS WILL HELP PPL WHO ARE STILL CONFUSED WHAT TO BUY..!!
      
      
      JUST TO LET YOU KNOW..I WENT TO BUY SAMSUNG S2..BUT I WENT FOR THIS..AND SONY PROVED ME RIGHT..WAITING FOR JELLY BEAN UPDATE!!"
Xperia P,5,"I ADMIT IT'S NOT THE BEST PHONE IN THE RANGE....
      
      
      BUT WITH THE RECENT SOFTWARE UPDATES THIS PHONE FEELS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
      
      IF YOU REALLY WANT THE BEST OUT OF IT'S BATTERY I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING JUICE DEFENDER &AMP; USE IT ALONGSIDE THE BATTERY STAMINA PROVIDED BY SONY. THIS COMBO WORKS WONDERS FOR THE BATTERY LIFE
      
      
      CAMERA IS GOOD, PIXELATES A BIT IN THE NIGHT MODE
      
      SPEAKER COULD'VE BEEN A BIT LOUDER"
Xperia P,5,"I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING EVERYONE ELSE SAYS, IT'S A GREAT PHONE AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY MAJOR GRIPES WITH IT AS OF TODAY. ITS A SNAPPY PHONE WITH A CLEAR DISPLAY AND THE UI IS REALLY GOOD.
      
      ONE SMALL GRIPE IS THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE PHONE BELOW THE TRANSPARENT PLASTIC STRIP SEEMS TO BE SLIGHTLY VULNERABLE TO TENSION, ITS MOVING A LITTLE BIT (MAYBE ABOUT HALF A MM!). MAYBE ITS JUST SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY PHONE. OTHERWISE ITS NEAR PERFECT!! GO FOR IT."
Xperia P,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST TWO MONTHS. I MUST SAY THIS IS BEST PHONE U WILL GET IN THE PRICE RANGE.
      
      
      UNI-BODY ALUMINIUM: JUST LIKE IPHONE 5 PREMIUM LOOK
      
      
      DUAL CORE PROCESSOR RUNS ANY GAME. I AM ALMOST DONE FINISHING ALPHALT 7
      
      
      HDMI PORT, CAMERA KEY, FRONT CAMERA: YOU CANT FIND ALL THESE FEATURES IN A SINGLE PHONE
      
      
      CONS(BY OTHERS)
      
      BAD BATTERY: I DON UNDERSTAND WHY OTHERS ARE BLAMING IT HAS BAD BATTERY LIFE. I AM GETTING ALMOST 2 DAYS OF BACK UP WITH 2 HRS OF WIFI USAGE AND 1 HR OF GAMING PER DAY
      
      
      NON REMOVABLE BATTERY: THE PHONE HAVEN'T HUNG ON ME SINCE I BOUGHT IT.  I DONT THING THIS AS CON POINT AT ALL.."
Xperia P,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST 2 MONTHS NOW..... AWESOME EXPERIENCE,GREAT CAMERA QUALITY,RECENTLY UPGRADED TO ANDROID 4.0.4 ICS,WHICH MAKES THE EXPERIENCE OF USING THE PHONE EVEN BETTER,LOTS OF ISSUES HAVE BEEN FIXED,BATTERY LIFE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY..IN SHORT IF YOU ARE LOOKING A PHONE IN THE RANGE OF 24000-25000/-..BUY IT WITHOUT ANY DOUBT...."
Xperia P,5,I BOUGHT THE XPERIA P JUSTA COUPLE OF NDAYS AND HAVE N0O ISSUES WITH IT SO FAR... THE BATTERY IS MODERATELY GOOD SO FAR WITH IT LASTING FOR A DAY WITH MODERATE USAGE. THE LOOKS ARE AMAZING AND THE QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS MIND BLOWING. IN ALL VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE PHONE. HATS OFF TOE SONY FOR MAKING A PHONE THATS WORTH IT.
Xperia P,5,"I BOUGHT THE XPERIA P TWO DAYS AFTER ITS LAUNCH SINCE I TRULY FELL IN LOVE WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL ALUMINUM BODY. I LIKED ALL ITS FEATURES AS WELL. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN HIGH END PHONE IF NOT FOR THE 1GHZ PROCESSOR.
      
      ONE CONCERN WHILE BUYING WAS ITS BATTERY! HAVING USED FOR 5 DAYS NOW, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE BATTERY LIFE IS VERY GOOD. ITS WHITEMAGIC IS AWESOME, CONSTANTLY CALIBRATING THE PHONE'S BRIGHTNESS ACCORDING TO LIGHT CONDITIONS. I HEAR THAT THE PROCESSOR IS LOW BATTERY CONSUMING TOO. OVERALL, I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS TILL NOW.
      
      SO FOR ALL THE CRITICS AND REVIEWERS WHO ARE SLATING THE PHONE FOR ITS BATTERY RATING WILL GET A LOT OF STICK ONCE THE ACTUAL XPERIA P USERS POST THEIR REVIEWS ABOUT THE BATTERY.
      
      DON'T YOU THINK SONY'S GOT NO SENSE IN PUTTING A LOW RATED BATTERY IN A 24K MODEL. DO U THINK YOUR MORE CLEVER THAN SONY'S JAPANESE RESEARCHERS?? THINK AGAIN!!!"
Xperia P,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 3 MONTHS AGO I'M NOT FACING A SINGLE PROBLEM WITH THE PHONE.AFTER THE ICS UPDATE THE PHONE HAS BECOME EVEN MORE FASTER AND THE DISPLAY CLARITY HAS INCREASED FROM BRILLIANT TO ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.THE BUTTONS ON THE TRANSPARENT STRIP ARE REALLY SENSITIVE AND WORKS GREAT.THE CAMERA CLARITY IS ALSO AMAZING ALMOST EQUAL TO S3.WHEN I COMPARED IT HAS MOST OF THE FEATURES OF S3 EXCEPT WATCHING VIDEO AND SIMULTANEOUSLY DOING OTHER WORK.
      
      PROS
      
      - DISPLAY (THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN COMPARED TO ALL PHONES IT HAS VERY HIGH PPI OF 275 AND IS LED BACKLIT)
      
      - WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY (IT SI RBGW WHERE AS OTHER PHONES ARE JUST RBG AND THIS REALLY MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IN DISPLAY AS WELL AS THE IMAGE CLARITY)
      
      - DESIGN  (THE TRANSPARENT STRIP ADDS FOR THE LOOK MAKING IT STUNNING)
      
      - FEATURES (IT HAS MOST OF THE S3 FEATURES IN IT)
      
      - BATTERY (THE WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY IMPROVE BATTERY LIFE AND ALSO ADDS FIR THE CRYSTAL CLEAR DISPLAY)
      
      - CHARGER (I'VE NEVER COME  ACROSS THIS KIND OF SUPER FAST CHARGING.REALLY TRUST ME IT CHARGES AMAZINGLY FAST)
      
      - UI IS PRETTY COOL
      
      - IT HAS A METAL BODY(MINE FELL FROM 2ND FLOOR AND THERE WAS A BIT CRACK IN BOTTOM CAP AND NOTHING ELSE EXCEPT SCRATCHS ON SCREEN GUARD)
      
      - IT HAS THE NFC SMART TAGS SUPPORT(NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION, 2 SMART TAGS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE BOX)
      
      - WALKMAN (IN THE NEW ICS UPDATE)
      
      - HDMI PORT
      
      - SCRATCH RESISTANT GLASS(TRUST ME IT IS ALMOST EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN THE SUPER AMOLED V2)
      
      
      ALL PHONES HAVE CONS SINCE NOTHING IS PERFECT BUT SONY HAS MADE AN ALMOST NEARING PERFECTION
      
      
      CONS
      
      - BOTTOM CAPS NOT CHANGABLE(THIS FEATURE IS IN XPERIA U IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF EVEN THIS HAD AN OPTION TO CHANGE BOTTOM CAP)
      
      - NOT EXPANDABLE( ONLY 13GB USABLE BUT WHICH IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR ME)
      
      - SMALL BATTERY
      
      - LOUD SPEAKER IS NOT SO LOUD
      
      - NO COLOUR LIGTS ON TRANSPARENT STRIP AS IN XPERIA U
      
      - HDMI CABLE NOT INCLUDED IN BOX
      
      I THINK THATS ALL OF ITS CONS . ACTUALLY SPEAKING THESE ARE NOT AT ALL THE MAJOR CONS
      
      
      SERIOUSLY IF YOUR BUDGET IS 25K THEN JUST GO FOR IT WITHOUT SECOND THOUGHTS.THANKS FOR READING THE REVIEW HAVE A GOOD DAY"
Xperia P,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 8 MONTHS BACK WHEN IT WAS 25K AND  EVERY THING IS SMOOTH AND CRISP AND PERFORMANCE UNAFECTED EVEN AFTER 8 MONTHS OF USAGE..THERE IS ALMOST NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NEW ONE AND AN OLDER ONE..SO THE BUILD QUALITY IS VERY AWESOME (ALUMINUM)!THIS PHONE IS PERFECT FOR AN AVERAGE USERS AND GAMERS BOTH! GAMES LIKE NOVA 3 ,NFS MW, FIFA 12, AND ALMOST EVERY HD GAME RUNS SMOOTHLY WITHOUT ANY FRAME DROPS! (SOMETIMES U WOULD THINK THE SCREEN WOULD HAVE BEEN BIGGER!)"
Xperia P,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE A MONTH AGO, AND TILL NOW MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS SMARTPHONE HAS BEEN SIMPLY AWESOME !!!!!!! THE PHONE NOW COMES WITH ICS 4.04 (BOUGHT IT FROM THE SHOWROOM) THE ALUMINUM UNI BODY DESIGN GIVES IT A VERY SEXY AND PREMIUM FEEL.COMING TO THE PROCESSOR, WORKS REALLY SMOOTH PLAYED THE ANGRY BIRDS STARWARS,TEMPLE RUN, AND MANY MORE GAMES !!! THE PHONE PLAYS 1080PI MOVIES WITH REAL EASE BECAUSE OF THE MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE,AND DUE TO THE WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY THE PHONE'S DISPLAY IS BRIGHT EVEN ON A SUNNY DAY!!!! NOW THE MOST QUESTIONED SEGMENT THE BATTERY BACKUP ,IT LAST FOR A THE WHOLE DAY WITH 1HR GAMING 2 HRS OF VOICE CALL AN HOUR OR 2 FOR WIFI AND VIDEO VIEWING,4-5 HRS OF MUSIC PLAYER AND RADIO AND STILL AT THE END OF THE DAY I GET 40% OF BATTERY CHARGE LEFT(PLZZ DONT INSTALL ANY BATTERY SAVER APPS!! BELIEVE ITS OF NO USE) ACCORDING TO ME ITS THE BEST SMARTPHONE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET AT THIS PRICE RANGE!!!!! THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED TO BUY THIS I WOULD SAY GO FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Xperia P,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FEW DAYS BACK AND I AM AMAZED WITH THE LOOK AND FEEL. SONY HAS DONE FABULOUS WORK!
      
      
      1. DISPLAY IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. VERY SHARP AND FANTASTIC RESOLUTION.
      
      2. VERY GOOD TOUCH
      
      3. SUPERBLY DESIGNED I BET YOU WILL LOVE IT.
      
      4. CAMERA IS AS ALWAYS UNBELIEVABLE.
      
      5. AUDIO QUALITY IS SUPERB.
      
      6. ICS RUNS FINE.
      
      
      ONLY PROBLEM I FACED WHILE USING XPERIA P IS VOLUMN OF SPEAKER.
      
      
      JUST SEE THIS MOBILE ANYWHERE IF YOU GET A CHANCE I BET YOU WON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT OTHER MOBILE BRANDS. HONESTLY MIND BLOWING."
Xperia P,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON OCT WHICH HAD ICS OUT OF THE BOX !!! MY ONE MONTH EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE IS OSM !!!
      
      
      SOME BEST FEATURES ARE :
      
      
      - VIDEO CLARITY: YO CANNOT IMAGINE SUCH A CLARITY WHILE WATCHING A 1080P HD VIDEO .ITS BRAVIA ENGINE IS SUPERB ...
      
      
      - PROCESSOR SPEED : NO LAG OR RESTART SO FAR..YOU CAN PLAY ANY HIGH DEF GAMES WITHOUT ANY LAGS...IT EVEN PERFORMS FASTER THAN S3 ( GUYS ITS REALLY TRUE )
      
      
      - ALUMINIUM BODY : IT GIVES THE CLASSY LOOK WHICH YOU CANNOT SEE IN ANY OTHER PHONES ON THIS RANGE...ITS REALLY SUPERB BUT FEELS SLIPPERY ...
      
      
      - TOUCH : IT WORKS LIKE BUTTER.. TOUCH IS WORKING SUPERBLY WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY
      
      
      CONS :
      
      
      - SOUND : SOUND IS NOT AS BEST AS OTHER MOBILES IN THIS PRICE RANGE. SONY FAILS TO HOLD ITS RANK ON THIS ASPECT.
      
      
      - BATTERY : SONY COULD HAVE PLACED SOME HIGH CAPACITY BATTER RATHER THAN 1300MA..BUT IF YOU ARE NOT A GAME LOVER YOUR MOBILE WILL LAST A DAY WITH BATTERY...
      
      
      GUYS MY OPINION IS ITS THE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER SEEN !!!
      
      
      NO ANDROID WILL LAST MORE THAN A DAY WITHOUT CHARGING SO DONT WORRY ABOUT THE BATTERY..SOUND IS VERY GOOD IN HEADPHONE !"
Xperia P,5,"I DINT BUY THIS PHONE VIA FLIPKART, BUT JUST GIVING MY FEEDBACK.
      
      THE PHONE IS REALLY AWESOME. I HAD SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE AND SONY XPERIA P IN THE  SAME PRICE RANGE, WHEN I PUT BOTH PHONES NEARBY, THE SCREEN RESOLUTION OF XPERIA IS TOO GOOD AND COULDNT LOOK AT SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE.
      
      
      TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS WONDERFUL, WORKS LIKE A BREEZE
      
      CAMERA HAS OPTION TO TAKE VIDEOS IN 720P OR 1080P, AGAIN GOOD CAMERA
      
      NFC TAGS NOT YET SURE HOW MUCH OF USE ITS GOING TO BE.
      
      REST EVERYTHING IS JUST GR8."
Xperia P,5,"I GIFTED ONE TO MY WIFE...IT'S SIMPLY AMAZING PHONE..GREATTTT CAMERA, FANTASTIC BUILD QUALITY, WOW SCREEN. I WAS INITIALLY IN DOUBTS BECAUSE OF THE LOW BATTERY SPECIFICATION BUT IT'S NOT A BIG THING IF YOU DON'T USE 3G, IT'S COMPARABLE TO THE OTHER SMARTPHONES."
Xperia P,5,"I HAVE AN SAMSUNG NOTE AND WANTED TO GIFT MY WIFE A DECENT ANDROID PHONE, AFTER SPENDING FEW MINUTES ON INTERNET ZEROED IN ON SONY XPERIA RANGE. AND AFTER READING REVIEWS FOR VARIOUS XPERIA'S SELECTED THIS MODEL.
      
      
      WITHOUT A DOUBT I CAN SAY THIS PHONE GIVES YOU THAT PREMIUM PHONE FEELING..
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY IS AMAZING AND THE PERFORMANCE IS ALSO VERY GOOD (WITH ICS).
      
      
      DON'T WORRY ABOUT ""NO EXPANSION SLOT"" 11.5 GB AVAILABLE SPACE IS GOOD.. AND YOU CAN ALSO USE USB ON THE GO.. AND THAT HDMI OUTPUT IS COOL!!!
      
      
      YET TO EXPLORE THE SMART TAGS, WILL UPDATE IT.. ABOVE ALL THE PERSON WHO GOT THIS GIFT WAS VERY HAPPY..
      
      
      PS: FLIPKART SHOULD GIVE AN OPTION ON SELECTING THE DELIVERY DATE, ORDERED IT ON DEC 25TH THINKING IT WILL REACH BY DEC 31ST (THE B'DAY DATE) BUT IT WAS DELIVERED VERY NEXT DAY."
Xperia P,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR 20 DAYS AND THIS BELOW IS WHAT I FEEL.....
      
      I WILL NOT BE DIVIDING INTO PROS AND CONS, PLEASE BEAR..
      
      
      1) THE CAMERA IS EXCELLENT WITH LOTS OF PICS BETTER THAN MY DSC AND FRANKLY SPEAKING, FOR THAT WOW MOMENT YOU WONT HAVE TIME TO BRING OUT, SWITCH ON YOUR DSC TO CAPTURE IT, BUT THIS PHONE DOES JUST THIS WITH AWE. VERY FAST CAPTURE SPEED. JUST ONE PROBLEM, SOMETIMES THERE IS EXTRA LIGHT IN INDOOR NIGHT SHOTS.
      
      
      2) THE UI IS GREAT, SNAPPY AND FAST. AND I HAVE TRIED OTHER LAUNCHERS TOO LIKE GO AND ADW, BUT THE INBUILT ONE FEELS THE BEST WITHOUT ANY SORT OF LAG. FOR ME, THE 5 HOME SCREENS (FIXED) ARE A LITTLE LESS THAN ENOUGH.
      
      
      3) THE DISPLAY IS JUST MINDBLOWING AND COULD GIVE AMOLED A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY, SPECIALLY WITH SONY'S NEW WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY WHICH ENSURES YOU DONT HAVE PAIN WHILE READING OUTDOORS.
      
      
      4) THE LOUDSPEAKER VOLUME IS A LITTLE LOWER HAN EXPECTED AND I FRANKLY DONT KNOW WHAT THAT XLOUD IS THERE FOR, BUT PLUG IN THE PROVIDED HEADSET OR CREATIVE SPEAKERS AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT SONY IS MADE UP OF. ITS UNBELIEVABLE.
      
      
      5) THE SCREEN HAS ENOUGH AREA FOR AN USER, I JUST DONT FEEL ONE WITH THE 4.7 INCH ONES.
      
      
      6) THOUGH ITS RUNNING GINGERBREAD, ITS GREAT AND STABLE TOO. AND ICS IS ON THE WAY, SO NO PROBLEM THERE. PLEASE DONT REJECT THE PHONE WITH THIS AS AN EXCUSE. SONY HAS ALREADY RELEASED A FIRMWARE UPDATE 6.0.B.3.184 IN THE MEANTIME FOR FIXING SOME NETWORK PROBLEMS I AM GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT LATER.
      
      
      7) WHEN I BOUGHT THE PHONE, I WAS USING AIRTEL AND THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NETWORK DROP ISSUE (WHEN I HELD THE PHONE COVERING THE TRANSPARENT STRIP, NETWORK DROPPED TO 1 BAR) THOUGH I DID NOT HAVE DROPPED CALL ISSUE. I WAS INCLINED TO CALL IT DEATH GRIP BUT SINCE IT WASNT HAPPENING OUTDOORS, IT WAS A SOFWARE ISSUE WHICH IS FIXED WITH THE LATEST UPDATE. I USE A VODAFONE NOW AND GET A 3G SPEED OF 2 TO 3 MBPS WITHOUT ANY KIND OF NETWORK DROP, SO I GUESS IT WAS A SIGNAL ISSUE.
      
      
      8) BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT, WHICH I DONOT EXPECT FROM AN ANDROID PHONE, AND CONSIDERING THAT I AM A HARDCORE USE, IT LASTS ME MORE THAN 1 AND A HALF DAYS WITH EASE.
      
      
      9) I HAVE PLAYED GAMES LIKE ANGRY BIRDS, NFS SHIFT, TEMPLE RUN, WITHOUT ANY LAG, HITCH OR CRASH WHATSOEVER. I USE MOBOPLAYER BUT THE STOCK PLAYER IS AS GOOD. THE MUSIC PLAYER IS EXCELLENT. AND TRACK ID IS JUST SO COOOOOOL.
      
      
      10) FOR THE RECORD, MY PHONE HAS NOT HANGED A SINGLE TIME SINCE I TURNED IT ON WHILE BUYING THE SET.
      
      
      11) IN DISPLAY, I WILL GIVE IT 20 OUT OF 10, JUST FOR ITS INNOVATIVE TRANSPARENT STRIP DESIGN AND METAL FEEL, WITH THE COLOUR.
      
      
      12) SOME GREAT APPS TO DOWNLOAD ARE 3G WATCHDOG FOR MONITORING DATA USAGE, PULSE FOR NEWS FEED, PREY FOR TRACKING DOWN MOBILE, ADOBE READER AND SO ON......
      
      
      13) BELIEVE ME 16 GB ON BOARD MEMORY IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR USERS IF YOU PLAN TO USE IT LIKE A MOBILE PHONE AND NOT ANYTHING ELSE.
      
      
      14) CONNECTIVITY: HDMI IS GREAT WITH A DEDICATED TV LAUNCHER PRE INSTALLED, NOKIA HEADSETS ARE NOT WORKING WITH IT ( I USE WH-701),  USB ON-THE-GO IS WORKING LIKE A CHARM, NFC IS ALSO THERE, AND WIFI I HAVENT USED YET.
      
      
      15) ONE OF THE MORE SURPRISING FEATURES IS THE GREENHEART POWER BOOSTER CHARGER. IT EFFICIENTLY CHARGES MY PHONE FROM 15% TO 100% IN 2 TO 3 HOURS.
      
      
      SO THATS ALMOST ALL OF IT. NOW MAKE A WISE DECISION AND DO ADEQUATE RESEARCH, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS, IF 25000 IS YOUR BUDGET, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND GO FOR THIS SET, YOU WONT REGRET IT.
      
      
      REGARDS"
Xperia P,5,I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR PAST TWO DAYS AND IT WORKS JUST AS EXPECTED! APPLICATIONS OPEN VERY FAST! BATTERY BACKUP IS ALSO VERY GOOD... THE SCREEN CLARITY AND THE ALUMINIUM UNIBODY GIVES IT A ROYAL FEEL!
Xperia P,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT SONY XPERIA P TODAY TO BE FRANK ,                   1 ST THING U NOTICE ON THE PHONE IS THE DESIGN ITS SO SLEEK AND QUITE HANDY AND THE DESIGN LOOKS VERY GOOD.
      
      2.NOW THE NEXT THING IS DISPLAY , WHEN U SEE THE DISPLAY U SAY WOW ITS SO CLEAR AND SO GOOD AND EVEN THE TOUCH IS VERY SMOOTH.
      
      3.CAMERA 8 MEGA AWESOME VERY CLEAR AND EVEN 0.3 MEG FRONT CAMERA IS GOOD.TRUST ME PICTURES ARE VERY CLEAR COMPARE TO GALAXYS2.
      
      4.ABOUT PROCESSOR VERY FAST AND QUICK RESPONSE AND BROWSING INTERNET IS FUN VERY COOL,BUT I HAVEN'T TRIED GAMES YET.
      
      5.ABOUT MEMORY 16GB ENOUGH FOR ME NOT AN ISSUE.
      
      BUT DRAWBACKS ARE DISPLAY COULD ME MORE WIDE IN WIDTH.
      
      BUT ON THE WHOLE VERY GOOD PHONE GO FOR IT BETTER THEN S2GALAXY WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THEN P."
Xperia P,5,"I HAVE BROUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPCART AND CHOOSE IT OVER SAMSUMG GALEXY S3 AND SONY XPERIA S DUE TO ITS DISTINCTIVE ALUMINIUM UNIBODY CONSTRUCTION WITH TRANSPARENT BELT.
      
      
      USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST 30 DAY. FIRST I WANT TO REVEAL SOME GOOD FEATURES OF THIS
      
      PHONE
      
      1)  ITS DESIGN IS DISTINCTIVE THAN ANY OTHER MOBILE PHONES IN THE MARKET. IT HAS ALUMINIUM UNIBODY CONSTRUCTION AND TRANSPARENT BELT THATS WHY I CHOOSE THIS MOBILE OVER SAMSUNG GALEXY S3 AND HTC ONE X. SONY XPERIA S ALSO HAS THE SAME DESIGN BUT COMES WIYH THE PLASTIC FINISH.
      
      
      2) ITS DISPLAY IS BRIGHTER THAN ANY OTHER DISPLAY IN THE MARKET.
      
      YOU CAN SEE THE SCREEN CLEARLY EVEN IN THE SUNLIGHT WITH BRIGHTNESS LEVEL SET TO 60%. THIS IS THE BEST FEATURE OF THIS PHONE.TOUCH SCREEN WORKS LIKE BUTTER. ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURE IS THE TOUCH BUTTONS ON THE TRANSPARENT GLASS STRIP AND WORKS AS SMOOTH AS CAPACITIVE TOUCH CONTROLS ON ANY OTHER ANDROID PHONES.
      
      3) ITS CAMERA IS EXCELLENT IN THIS PRIZE RANGE. I HAVE CAPTURED MANY PICTURES WITH IT AND THE IMAGE QUALITY IS BRILLIANT.
      
      ALSO THE LOW LIGHT PICTURES ARE VERY NICE. IT CAN CAPTURE FULL HD VIDEO WITH AWESOME QUALITY. SOUND QUALITY OF HEADPHONE IS EXCELLENT.
      
      4) THE USER INTERFACE IS PRETTY COOL. BETTER THAN THE SAMSUNG, LG AND HTC SENSE UI. I HAVE UPDATE MY PHONE TO ICS 4.0.4 SANDWICH WHICH WORKS SMOOTHLY AN IT. THE NEW FACE RECOGNITION SCREEN LOCK WORKS VERY SMOOTH.I HAVE INSTALLED MANY RACING GAMES LIKE RAGING THUNDER AND NFS SHIFT RUNS SMOOTHLY WITH NO LAGS IN ANIMATION.
      
      5) ITS CHARGER CHARGE 100% IN ONLY 1HR AND 15 MIN.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      1) BATTERY LIFE IS NOT SATISFACTORY.
      
      2) MICRO SIM CARD SLOT IS LETDOWN.
      
      ( I HAVE CUT MY OLD SIM-CARD TO FIT IN THIS PHONE.
      
      3) SPEAKER ARE NOT SO LOUD."
Xperia P,5,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS MOBILE. ITS REALLY AWESOME. I ALREADY HAD GALAXY S . WHEN COMPARED WITH IT, SCREEN RESOLUTION IS GREAT. IT HAS EVERYTHING EXCEPT MEMORY CARD SLOT. BUT THE INBUILT MEMROY ITSELF IS 16 GB( 13GB USABLE). USER INTERFACE IS AMAZING. PROCESSING SPEED IS SUPERB. MOST SUITABLE FOR RUNNING HIGH END APPS. ITS HAVING 2.3.7 ANDROID GINGERBREAD. BATTERY IS ALSO GOOD BUT NOT BETTER THAN GALAXY S."
Xperia P,5,"I PLACE THIS ORDER ON THE 15TH OF AUGUST AND FLIPKART SELF DELIVERED IT ON THE 18TH AUGUST. AWESOME SERVICE ONCE AGAIN BY FLIPKART. I WANTED TO HAVE THE PRODUCT SENT TO MY NORTH EAST INDIA ADDRESS BUT FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON FLIPKART COULD NOT DELIVER THERE. SO I CHOSE MY BENGALURU ADDRESS INSTEAD WHICH FLIPKART DELIVERED IN NO TIME IN PERFECT CONDITION.
      
      I UPGRADED THE SOFTWARE TO 4.0.4 (ICS) AS SOON AS ITS AVAILABLE THROUGH SONY PC COMPANION. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MORE THAN 3 MONTHS NOW WITHOUT ANY ISSUE. COMING FROM A NON-SMART PHONE BACKGROUND WHERE BATTERY IS CHARGED ONCE EVERY 2-3 DAYS, THE DIFFERENCE COULD BE CLEARLY SEEN IN BATTERY LIFE AT THE BEGINNING. BUT WITH CONTINUOUS USAGE BATTERY LIFE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM AFTER ALL AND SOMETIMES (WHEN THE PHONE IS NOT HEAVILY USED) I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO COMPULSORY CHARGE MY PHONE ONCE A DAY. I THOUGHT OF BUYING A SCREEN GUARD BUT AFTER USING THE PHONE FOR SOMETIME NOW, I DON'T THINK I NEED ONE WITH THE SCRATCH RESISTANT SCREEN IN PLACE. GO FOR IT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STYLISH, MID-RANGE PHONE."
Xperia P,5,"I PURCHASED THIS MOBILE MORE THAN A WEEK AGO AND I MUST SAY ITS REALLY FAST IN OPERATION. NO HANGUPS OR RESTARTS.
      
      UPGRADED TO ANDROID 4.0.4 AND THE MUSIC PLAYER IS NOW WALKMAN, WHICH IS REALLY AWESOME.
      
      DID NOT EXPLORE THE NFC FEATURE YET, REST ALL LOOKS JUST GREAT.
      
      ONLY THING IS THE BATTERY LIFE WHICH LASTS ONLY FOR A DAY PROVIDED MY USAGE, BUT NO ANDROID LASTS ANY LONGER.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL I AM REALLY HAPPY FOR MY MONEY."
Xperia P,5,"I SAW IT IN DECEMBER 2012 AND IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. I PURCHASED IT IN JANUARY 2013 FROM FLIP KART (AS ALWAYS FLIP KART IS THE BEST)
      
      
      XPERIA P AND ME WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER. IT IS SLEEK, SUPER FAST, HIGH QUALITY CAMERA, PREMIUM LOOKS (WITH ITS ALUMINUM CASING) AND PACKED WITH ALL KINDS OF FEATURES THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE IN A HIGH END PHONE. CAMERA QUALITY CAN EASILY BEAT IPHONE 4-5 AND SAMSUNG NOTE-1.
      
      
      SOME CONS:
      
      1. BATTERY BACK UP IS OF ONE DAY ONLY.
      
      2. COLOR COATING ON ALUMINUM CASE IS SENSITIVE AND MAY COME OUT DUE TO ROUGH HANDLING. I AM USING A OUTER PROTECTION CASE, AND IT WORKS FINE.
      
      3. NO GORILLA GLASS
      
      
      I AM IN LOVE WITH XPERIA P.

Xperia P,5,"I'M USING THIS PHONE FROM 1.5 MONTHS AND AT FIRST I SAY ABT SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS PHONE...
      
      
      IT BLINKS IN SOME APPLICATIONS AND HANGS SOME TIMES
      
      INBUILT GALLERY IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY, BUT DONT WORRY ABT THIS, LOTS OF IN MARKET...
      
      
      I SHOWED IT IN SERVICE CENTER 2 OR 3 TIME SERVICED AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTS... THEN SONY REPLACED WITH A NEW MOB.. BUT THIS PRBLM IS WITH THAT PHN...
      
      
      BUT NW I DONT CARE ABT THIS... BECAUSE ICS IS ON THE WAY, IF I GOT UPDATED THIS PRBLM WILL BE SOLVED...
      
      
      IN MY OPINION AND SHARING WITH FRNDS USING ANDROID EVERY ANDROID PHN WILL HAVE SOME PROBLMS. BUT THIS IS THE PHONE WITH LESSOR PRBLMS
      
      
      AND THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PART IS THE SMART LOOK OF THIS PHONE. THE TRANSPARRENT STRIP MAKES THE PHONE LOOKS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PHONETHE ALUMINIUM UNI BODY DISIGN IS VERY GOOD.THE WHITE MAGIC DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD. AWSOME 8 MP CAMERA AND 1080P VIDEO RECORDING IS VERY GOOD.PROCESSOR IS VERY FAST. ALL THING ARE VERY GOOD AND I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER..."
Xperia P,5,"ITS 5 MONTHS SINCE I AM USING THIS PHONE. IF U WANNA PAMPER YOURSELF, BUY IT. CAMERA IS SUPERB. THE NIGHT SCENE OPTION REALLY HELPS U TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE PICTUR EVEN ON A MOONLESS NIGHT.

      CON'S:
      
      IT WOULD BE GREAT IF MEMORY EXPANSION IS AVAILABLE
      
      ONLY MICRO SIM CAN BE USED"
Xperia P,5,"ITS BEEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS I HAVE THIS PHONE NOW.HAVE UPGRADED IT TO ICS AND IT WORKS JUST AS FINE AS IT DID WITH JB.GAMES HAVENT GOT A SINGLE LAG TILL NOW AND THE DISPLAY IS THE BEST.CAMERA IS TOO GOOD IN DAYLIGHT BUT NOT SO WEN USING FLASH.MEMORY MYT BE A LITTLE LESS BUT I USE OTG CABLES TO CONNECT TO PD TO WATCH HD MOVIES WHILE TRAVELLING.MUSIC QUALITY ALSO IS GOOD.THE BUTTON ON THE TRANSPARENT STRIP WORKS UNLIKE IN U &AMP; S.
      
      EVEN THE BATTERY IS GOOD ENOUGH.FOR THE ONES HAVING PROBLEM WITH BATTERY I WOULD ADVICE DON USE LIVE WALLPAPERS,KEEP THE BACKLIGHT OFF,KEEP AUTO SYNC OFF AND USE JUICE DEFENDER.I BET U WONT HAVE ANY PROB AFTER DAT.
      
      THE ONLY PROB IM FACING IS THE FACE DETECTION IS NOT WORKING FOR UNLOCKING THE SCREEN EVEN AFTER UPGRADING TO ICS.HOPE THESE PROB WILL RESOLVE ONCE JELLY BEAN IS OUT.OVERALL THE PHONE IS THE BEST WITHOUT ANY DOUBT"
Xperia P,5,"ITS VERY SIMPLE AND STYLISH MOBILE   .ITS  GLASS TOUCH PANEL VERY BEST AND SMOOTH PICTURE QUALITY IS VERY BEST

Xperia P,5,"I'VE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT A WEEK .. ITS MY 1ST ANDROID PHONE .. AFTER DROOLING OVER EVERYONE'S DESIRES AND S2S ..
      
      BOY AM I GLAD THAT I CHOSE THIS PHONE ... I WAS ALWAYS A SONY FAN AND THIS PHONE PERFECTLY REALISES THEIR DESIGN PHILOSOPHY .
      
      PROS:
      
      1. VERY PREMIUM BUILD .. THIS PHONE FEELS INDESTRUCTILBE .. AND WORTH FOR ITS MONEY
      
      THE DATA CABLE YOU GET WITH WILL BLOW YOU AWAY ..
      
      2. THE SCREEN IS TO DIE FOR .. K-POP SONGS REALLY POP OUT WITH ALL THE VIBRANT COLOURS AND THE BRIGHTNESS ON IT IS UNREAL
      
      3. THE LITTLE LITTLE SONY EXCLUSIVES PROVIDED ON THEIR PHONES LIKE TRACKID, PLAYNOW, WALKMAN ARE REALLY GREAT, THOUGH SOME FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN GPLAY AS PAID APPS BUT THE INTEGRATION IS UNMATCHED .
      
      4.  THE ICS TIMESCAPE UI IS THE BEST I HAVE SEEN .. MUCH BETTER THAN TOUCHWHIZ , VERY SLEEK
      
      5. AND ITS LOOKS SEXY AS HELL !!
      
      
      CONS :
      
      1. THE BIGGEST CON IS THE BATTERY LIFE .. ITS NOT GOOD .. NOT OK .. BUT BAD .. ITS A CONSTANT WORRY (INVEST IN A GOOD CAR CHARGER )
      
      2. AS WITH SONY ALWAYS .. THEIR PC COMPANION APPS ARE TOTAL BULLSHIT .. ONCE YOU USE IT YOU'LL COME TO KNOW ( JUST DOWNLOAD SONY UPDATE SERVICE FOR YOUR UPDATING NEEDS 40ISH MB )
      
      3. THE PHONE IS NOT THAT LOUD .. IT BECOMES APPARENT IN A FEW DAYS ...
      
      4. NON EXPANDABLE MEMORY ... THE SCREEN BEGS YOU TO PUT HIGHER QUALITY MEDIA .. THIS EATS UP THE AVAILABLE 11 GB FASTER THAN YOU KNOW IT ..
      
      
      BASIC TIPS
      
      1. DOWNLOAD SONY UPDATE SERVICE .. ITS THE LEAST BUGGIEST UPDATE METHOD
      
      1ST UPDATE 170ISH
      
      2ND UPDATE 50ISH
      
      2. UNINSTALL MCAFFE .. ITS CRAP AND BETTER FREE ONES ARE AVAILABLE
      
      3. THE PHONE COMES WITH A SCREEN PROTECTOR ALREADY INSTALLED
      
      4. DO NOT TRY TO REMOVE TO THE BOTTOM CAP .. REPEATED FIDDLING MAKES IT LOOSE
      
      5. NO NEED FOR ANY BATTERY APPS FROM GPLAY .. THE ICS UPDATE COMES WITH A SETTING BUILT IN THAT WORKS BETTER
      
      6. CHECK YOUR BATTERY LEVEL ALWAYS ...
      
      
      THANKS .. I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR PHONE LIKE I DO"
Xperia P,5,"LOVE IT FOR
      
      1 AMAZING DISPLAY.

      4 SILKY SMOOTH UI WITH REALLY GOOD MULTI TASKING ABILITIES.
      
      
      HATE IT FOR:
      
      1. BAD BATTERY
      
      2. NO ICS (THOUGH SONY HAS PROMISED AN UPDATE IN THE COMING WEEKS)
      
      
      I BOUGHT IT THE DAY IT WAS LAUNCHED AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT YOU HAVE TO OWN IT TO FEEL IT.... SO JUST GO AHEAD AND GET IT."

I DIDN'T FACE ANY HANGING ISSUE AND CAMERA CLARITY IS ALSO AWESOME. ANDROID 4 ICS UPDATE ALSO AVAILABLE AND CAN UPGRADE IMMEDIATELY.
      
      
      I FEEL BELOW ARE SMALL DISAPPOINTMENTS:-
      
      
      1. ONLY MICRO SIM CAN BE USED.
      
      2. ONLY 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND MEMORY CARD SLOT NOT AVAILABLE(FOR NORMAL USERS THIS IS ENOUGH).
      
      3. ANDROID UPGRADE WAS EXTREMELY SLOW THROUGH PC COMPANION AND IT HAS TAKEN MORE THAN ONE HOUR TO UPGRADE. I AM USING 4 MBPS CONNECTION STILL IT HAS TAKEN LONG TIME FOR UPGRADE.

      MUSIC: HEAD PHONES(EAR BUD) IS MARVELOUS. BEFORE THAT I'M USING SKULL CANDY WORTH 1200 BUT SONY HEAD PHONES ARE LITTLE BIT SUPERB THAN SKULL CANDY.
      
      
      NFC: IN FUTURE U CAN OPEN UR CAR USING UR SONY XPERIA THROUGH NFC. THEY GAVE 2 NFC'S.

Xperia P,5,"SONY XPERIA P, U AND SOLA USE DIFFERENT CHIPSETS FROM THOSE IN EARLIER RELEASED XPERIA PHONES. IT CONTAINS STE NOVATHOR U8500 WHILE PREVIOUS XPERIA PHONES USE QUALCOMM SNAPDRAGON. U8500 CHIPSET IS MUCH MORE POWER EFFICIENT AND HENCE LOWER MAH BATTERY IS BEING USED."

      BUT SONY SHOULD HAV PROVIDED CARD SLOT OR KEPT THE INTERNAL MEMORY AT 32GB INSTEAD OF 16 GB WITHOUT CARD  SLOT........
      
      THAT WOULD HAV BEEN GR8........"
Xperia P,5,"THE SONY XPERIA P,STANDING IN BETWEEN THE SONY XPERIA U AND BIG DADDY SONY XPERIA S,IS THE PERFECT MID RANGE PHONE AT THE MOMENT !IT COMES WITH THE LATEST WHITE MAGIC DISPLAY AND HAS THE BRIGHTEST SCREEN ON ANY PHONE IN THE WORLD UP TO DATE!WELL TALKING ABOUT THE EXTERIORS IT IS GR8 TO HOLD IN UR HAND AS IT HAS A 4 INCH DISPLAY WITH A UNIQUE RECTANGULAR DESIGN WITH SOME SHARP EDGES MAKE THE DESIGN LIKE ANY OF THE SONYS CONTEMPORARY DESIGN ! ALONG WITH ALUMINIUM UNI-BODY DESIGN U HAVE THE TRANSPARENT BAND WHICH HOST THE TOUCH SENSITIVE BUTTON AND WHICH ENHANCES THE PREMIUM APPEAL TO THE PHONE ! THE BUTTONS ON THE SIDES ARE PLACED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DEVICE WHEREAS THE PORTS INCLUDING HDMI IS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE !COMING TO THE INTERNALS IT BOASTS OF THE NOVATHOR U8500 PROCESSOR(COMMONLY CALLED CORTEX A-9) WHICH A 1GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR ALONG WITH THE MALI 400 GPU(SAME GPU AS S2)! ALSO THE PROCESSOR IS THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT PROCESSOR IN THE WORLD AND HENCE THE BATTERY SIZE OF 1305 MAH MAY LOOK SMALL COMPARED TO THE OTHER SMART PHONES , IT CAN GUARANTEE U THE SAME AMOUNT OF USAGE TIME AS THE ONES WITH THE BIGGER BATTERIES! THE 1GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR CAN PLAY VIRTUALLY ALL THE APPS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT!IT COME WITH 16GB INTERNAL MEMORY, OF WHICH , 13GB IS USER ACCESSIBLE ! THE PHONE RUNS ANDROID 2.3.7 AND IS DUE FOR AN UPDATE DURING JULY-AUGUST FOR ICS 4.0 !THE CAMERA AS USUAL IS SONYS FORTE !WITH THE 8MP CAM IT TAKES STUNNING PHOTOS IN DAY LIGHT AS WELL AS IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS !ALSO IT CAN CLICK A PIC FROM LOCK SCREEN WITHIN JUST 1.5 SEC OF PRESSING THE CAMERA SHUTTER BUTTON ! IT ALSO HAS A FRONT FACING 0.3 MP FRONT CAM OF MODERATE QUALITY ! THE SONY XPERIA P HAS A GOOD MUSIC PLAYER DESIGN SOMEWHAT TAKING THE TILE BASED DESIGN INTERFACE OF WINDOWS 7 AND PLAY A WIDE RANGE OF FORMATS ! THE EARPHONE ON THIS PHONE IS ABOVE AVERAGE AND SOUND DOESN'T SEEM TO CRACK EVEN AT HIGH VOLUME!THE WEB BROWSER HOWEVER IS BELOW AVERAGE HOWEVER ANDROID MARKET HAS MANY BROWSERS AT THE MOMENT TO MAKE UR LIFE EASY !THE MEDIA PLAYER CAN PLAY 720 P AND 1080 P VIDEOS WITH EASE !THE TIMESCAPE UI PROVIDES U WITH MANY WIDGETS AND SOME FUNKY ANIMATIONS!ALSO IT HAS NFC AND COME WITH 2 NFC TAGS WHICH YOU WONT FIND IN ANY OTHER MOBILE AT THIS PRICE!NFC ENABLES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TWO NFC ENABLED DEVICES JUST BY TAPPING IT TO EACH OTHER!A VERY PROMISING TECHNOLOGY !JUST ONE ISSUE IS DAT WHEN YOU TURN THE BRIGHTNESS ABOVE 75/80 % THE YELLOW APPEAR GREENISH AND RED SOMEWHAT BROWNISH ! HOWEVER THE SONY DEVELOPERS SAID THAT IT WAS SUCH SO DAT THEY COULD MAINTAIN THE CLARITY AND READABILITY OF THE DEVICE AT SUCH HIGH LEVELS (REMEMBER SAYING IT HAS THE BRIGHTEST DISPLAY IN THE WORLD, IF NOT MISTAKEN 3 TIMES DAT OF S2).READING IN THE SUNLIGHT WILL NEVER BE A PROBLEM BUT THE COLOR MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE FIXED WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE I GUESS ! ALL IN ALL ITS D PHONE WHICH ONE WOULD DIE FOR !! WAITING TO GET MY HANDS ON THIS BEAUTY !!"
Xperia P,5,"THIS IS A SUPERB PIECE OF ELEGANCE AND SLEEK DESIGN. JUST GOT MY PIECE ON 3RD JUNE AND ITS AWESOME. THE COLOR ITSELF (SILVER) IS SO ROYAL. THE MOMENT THEY OPENED THE BOX WE WERE LIKE WOW :) ITS LIGHTER THAN XPERIA S AND ALSO GRIPS WELL IN THE HAND.
      
      THE PICTURE QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING OWING TO WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND DISPLAY AMAZES. TOUCH IS SUPER SENSITIVE AND THE TRANSPARENT STRIP IS CLASS APART.
      
      SO FAR HASN'T HANGED OR LAGGED IN TOUCH RESPONSES. PERFORMANCE WISE DOING GOOD. THE INTERFACE IS REALLY WONDERFUL. YOU OUGHT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS PIECE.
      
      SOUND ISN'T LIKE WALKMAN STANDARDS BUT ON EARPHONES ITS HEAVENLY. CAMERA IS GOOD THOUGH DIDN'T SHOOT ANY VIDEO YET BUT EX-MOR WORKS WELL.
      
      NEGATIVES: ONE MAJOR DRAWBACK WITNESSED SO FAR - BATTERY ISN'T THAT OUTSTANDING BUT BULK OF IT GOES INTO DISPLAY.IF YOU COULD MANAGE BRIGHTNESS AND ANIMATIONS PERFORMANCE CAN BE MANAGED. 15-16HRS MAX BATTERY LIFE. DISCHARGES RAPIDLY ON INTERNET USAGE. REMEMBER TO STOP UNWANTED SERVICES FROM RUNNING SERVICES LIST.
      
      RAM AVAILABLE IS 696MB OF 1GB...MEMORY AVAILABLE IS 11.8GB+1.2GB(IN INTERNAL MEMORY) = 13GB APPROX FOR USER OUT OF 16GB.
      
      WELL SO FAR THE FEEL IS GOOD BUT A BETTER BATTERY WOULD HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY IMPRESSIVE BUT SO FAR SO GOOD."
Xperia P,5,"THIS PHONE IS SO GOOD TO HANDLING.  SUPER INTERNET SPEED.  SUPERB DESIGN. GOOD TO HOLD IN PALM. ALREADY INSTALLED APPS, SECURITY. SUPERB CAMERA QUALITY.  BATTERY CHARGING SPEED SO FAST EVEN CAN WITHIN 20 MINUTES.   YOU SHOULD GO 2/3 TIMES DAILY CHARGE IF USING INTERNET, GAME AND MUSIC.  OTHERWISE ONCE A DAY CHARGING IS ENOUGH.  I LOVE IT. SONY CHAMPS."
Xperia P,5,"THOUGH I BOUGHT LONG AGO. I MADE THIS REVIEW ACC TO LATEST JELLYBEAN
      
      
      1)PERFORMANCE INCREASED AS SCORES IN ANTUTU INCREASED WITH RESPECT TO ICS.
      
      2)BATTERY STAMINA MODE REALLY DOES WORK AND SAVES BATTERY
      
      3)VERY LOW BATTERY DRAIN. ONLY 5% PER HOUR KEEPING GPS+DATA+AUTOSYNC ON. ONLY 1%-2% IF I KEEP THEM OFF
      
      4)GAMES RUN FLAWLESSLY WITHOUT ANY LAG. (GTA, SHAWDOW GUN, ASPHAULT7, NFS, WILDBLOOD ETC ETC)
      
      5)GOOD DEVELOPER SUPPORT AND EVEN CM9 AVAILABLE (VISIT XDA FORUMS)
      
      6)NO CAMERA BUG SINCE JELLYBEAN
      
      7) BRAVIA ENGINE GIVES YOU GOOD PICTURE QUALITY
      
      8) CHARGES FROM 10% TO 90% IN JUST 1 HOUR. ULTRA SPEED CHARGING
      
      9) GOOD EAR PHONES. BUT I FELT HTC BEATS IS BETTER THAN THIS.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1)PARTS ARE VVV HIGH COST (AFTER WARRANTY PERIOD)
      
      2)BOTTON CLIP BECAME LOOSE AFTER 4 MONTHS OF RIGOROUS USAGE
      
      
      ITS SONY MAN.DONT SEE SCREEN SIZE, SEE THE QUALITY."
Xperia P,5,"VERY WELL BUILT PHONE THANKS TO THE ALUMINIUM UNIBODY.THE 1 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND 1GB OF RAM PROVIDE A SOLID SMARTPHONE EXPERIENCE.BATTERY LIFE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THOUGH.
      
      JELLY BEAN UPDATE COMING SOON...."
Xperia P,5,"WE CAN'T SAY THAT THIS IS A MID-RANGE DEVICE AS PER AS THE FEATURES ARE CONCERNED.THE MID-RANGE DEVICES ARE HAVING ATLEAST 1500MAH BATTERY FOR 1GHZ PRECESSORS.
      
      BUT,WAIT A MINUTE.THIS ""SONY XPERIA P"" IS HAVING  1 GHZ DUAL-CORE PROCESSOR WITH 4 INCH DISPLAY.IT IS DEFINITE THAT IT WILL CONSUME MORE BATTERY POWER THAN THE OTHERS OF MID-RANGE CLASS.YOU ARE JUST GIVING A 1305MAH BATTERY FOR THIS SUPERB PHONE SONY ? ARE YOU KIDDING WITH US ?
      
      BUT,THERE'S A GOOD NEWS FRIENDS.THIS PHONE IS HAVING NOVA-THOR CHIPSET AND IT BRINGS US WHITE-MAGIC DISPLAY (FIRST FOR ANY SONY DEVICE) WHICH IS 50% MORE POWER EFFICIENT THAN THE NORMAL CHIPSETS. :)
      
      BUT,AS THIS IS A NEW PHONE TO THE MARKET,PEOPLE WILL SURELY NOT LIKE THE 1305MAH BATTERY OF THIS HIGH-END DEVICE BECAUSE THE NEW CHIPSET IS NOT TESTED BY THE USERS.COME ON,SONY!YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN A 1500MAH BATTERY ATLEAST FOR THIS 25K PHONE. :( APART FROM THIS,THIS IS THE REAL PHONE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.SUPERB. \M/
      
      
      CONS~ I)BATTERY IS NOT REMOVABLE, II)NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY CARD SLOT
      
      PROS~ THERE ARE LOTS OF PROS.NOTICABLE ONE IS 1GB RAM.
      
      
      THAT'S ALL.I MAY BE WRONG AS I'M WRITING THIS BEFORE THE HANDSET IS RELEASED.THAKS FOR READING.DATE-22/5/2012 TIME-11.14"
Xperia P,5,"WELL I HAD INITIALLY PLANNED TO BUY XPERIA SOLA BUT THEN I THOUGHT OF SPENDING A FEW BUCKS MORE AND BUY THIS BEAUTIFUL ARTIFACT;XPERIA P AS SONY HAS CONFIRMED THAT XPERIA SOLA WILL NOT GET JELLYBEAN :( :(
      
      THIS ONE'S A BEAUTIFUL DEVICE AND WORTH EVERY PENNY.
      
      BUT MY EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS ITS BETTER TO BUY THE DEVICE SPORTING ANDROID ICS OUT OF THE BOX INSTEAD OF THE ONE COMING WITH ANDROID GB AND LATER UPGRADING IT YOURSELF TO ICS.BELIEVE ME,SOME LAGS AND BUGS WILL CREEP IN POST UPGRADE. SO IF POSSIBLE DO CONFIRM WITH THE CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE IF YOU CAN GET ICS PREINSTALLED."
Xperia P,5,"WITH SONY ROLLING OUT THE NEW NXT SERIES.SONY SEEMS TO HAVE REACHED A NEW LEVEL ALL TOGETHER.
      
      SONY IS ONE OF THE ONLY COMPANIES WHICH ARE TRYING NEW THINGS CONSTANTLY AND PROVIDING A NEWER AND RICHER EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      CLEARING DOUBTS:
      
      JUSTIFYING THE LOWER BATTERY:
      
      
      1)WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY:
      
      INSTEAD OF 3 SUB-PIXELS XPERIA P HAS 4 SUB-PIXELS(EXTRA WHITE).
      
      THUS NATURAL BRIGHTNESS INCREASES DRASTICALLY AND CAUSES LESS USE OF BACK LIGHT REDUCING BATTERY USAGE DRASTICALLY.
      
      
      2)SONY XPERIA P HAS THE MOST POWER EFFICIENT CHIPSET
      
      
      3)THE CHARGER SUPPORTS BOOST CHARGING. IT TOPS OFF THE BATTERY VERY QUICKLY (E.G. 10 MINUTES OF CHARGING FOR 60 MINUTES OF TALK TIME) UP TO A POINT (80%) AND THEN SLOWS DOWN (THIS IS DONE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BATTERY).-GSM ARENA
      
      
      JUSTIFYING 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY:
      
      I HAVE A 16GB MEMORY CARD ON MY CELL PHONE(SE LWW)AND ITS MORE THAN ENOUGH.
      
      I STORE LOTS OF SONGS AND PLAY GAMES LIKE DEAD SPACE,ASPHALT 6,ME INFILTRATOR THAT ARE MASSIVE GAMES AND I STILL HAVE ABOUT 5GB UNUSED.
      
      TRUST ME YOU CANT USE MORE THAN 16 GB
      
      
      OTHER SPECIAL FEATURES THAT OTHER DONT HAVE:
      
      1)TRANSPARENT STRIP
      
      2)METAL UNI-BODY (ADDS A PREMIUM FEEL)
      
      3)VERY HIGH PPI(275)(CRISP IMAGES)
      
      4)MASSIVE FACEBOOK INTEGRATION
      
      5)VERY EFFICIENT SWYPE KEYBOARD(TESTED)
      
      6)AWESOME MUSIC PLAYER
      
      7)REALLY GOOD UI(BETTER THAN SAMSUNG,MOTO,LG ANY DAY)(HTC IS JUST AS GOOD)
      
      8)EXCELLENT CAMERA(FULL HD VIDEO RECORDING)
      
      9)EPIC UI(TIMESCAPE IS A CHERRY ON THE CAKE)
      
      10)BEST PROCESSOR IN THE PRICE(SAME GPU AS SG SII)
      
      11)NFC SMART TAGS
      
      12)HDMI AND USB-OTG(FOR PEOPLE IN THE KNOW)
      
      
      I AM NOT SAYING THAT THE MOBILE IS PERFECT BUT THE CONS WERE NECESSARY TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE.ALSO SONY HAS MADE A SPECTACULAR EFFORT TO MAKE THE CONS NEGLIGIBLE.BUT SMALL AS THEY MAY BE THEY ARE STILL CONS
      
      CONS
      
      1)SMALLER BATTERY
      
      2)THERE ARE 4.3"" SCREENS OUT THERE(4.0 IS AVERAGE)
      
      3)16GB INTERNAL MEMORY IS NOT ENOUGH IF YOU WANT OVER KILL
      
      4)1080P VIDEO RECORDING IS BETTER THAN 720P SHOOTERS ANYDAY BUT CANT COMPETE WITH TOP CLASS 1080P SHOOTERS
      
      5)NO ICS OUT OF BOX(NONE OF THE COMPETITION HAS EITHER)(SONY HAS CONFIRMED AN UPDATE IN COMING 2 MONTHS)
      
      
      COMPETITION:
      
      
      1)HTC SENSATION:
      
      
      FOR A LITTLE BIGGER SCREEN,CONDITIONALLY BETTER UI AND MICRO-SD SLOT(UNNECESSARY) YOU HAVE TO COMPROMISE WITH PERFORMANCE(NOT GOOD GPU OR PROCESSOR AND LOW RAM)(NOT SURE IF IT WILL GET ICS UPDATE)
      
      
      2)MOTO ATRIX 2
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE BUT IT HAS A BAD CAMERA PERFORMANCE AND VIRTUALLY NO SERVICE IN INDIA.BUT IT IS REALLY CHEAP IN COMPARISON TO XPERIA-P AND GIVES A BIGGER SCREEN.ALSO ITS LOOKS ARE NO MATCH FOR XPERIA P AND IT HAS A SUCKY UI.PERFORMANCE IS NEARLY SAME(GPU LACKS A LITTLE)
      
      
      3)HTC ONE S:
      
      WHILE ONE S IS SUBSTANTIALLY COSTLIER(BY 4 THOUSAND) IT PROVIDES
      
      REALLY GOOD IMPROVEMENTS AND ICS INBUILT.
      
      
      4)SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE:
      
      
      DONT BUY THIS SHIT PHONE FOR THE SAME PRICE.
      
      THE ONLY GOOD THING IT PROVIDES IS A MICRO-SD SLOT FOR HUGE COMPROMISES.
      
      
      BUT IF 25000 IS YOUR BUDGET LIMIT THEN XPERIA P IS THE BEST DEAL YOU CAN GET.AND I M NOT KIDDING!!SONY ALL THE WAY"
Xperia P,5,"XPERIA P IS MIDRANGE SMART PHONE WITH AMAZING FEATURES. DUAL CORE PROCESSOR GIVES GREATER PERFORMANCE . TOUCH IS SPECIAL IN SONY AS USUAL.
      
      PRONS:
      
      PERFORMANCE
      
      DISPLAY QUALITY
      
      CONS:
      
      NO EXTERNAL MEMORY
      
      SOFTWARE PROBLEM FOR CAMERA
      
      OVERALL SONY AT IT BEST..
      
      BIT COSTLIER"
Xperia P,5,"XPERIA P. IT STANDS OUT. WHITE MAGIC, TRANSPARENT STRIP, ALUMINUM UNIBODY ARE SOME EXCLUSIVE FEATURES. THE PHONE BOASTS A 1GHZ DUAL CORE PROC AND 1GB RAM. MAKES RUN APPLICATIONS SMOOTHLY. CAMERA IS SUPERB AND FAR BETTER THAN LUMIA. GAMING GRAPHICS ARE ALSO GOOD, I GUESS MALI400 GPU EATS ALOT OF RAM. SO FAR ITS GOOD TO ME, RECENTLY UPGRADED TO JB 4.1.2. GOT FEW MORE FEATURES. THIS PHONE LOOKS SOLID AND FEELS SOLID IN THE HANDS, I LIKE TO SEE IT KEPT ON MY OFFICE TABLE. A BLACK BEAUTY..."
Xperia P,5,"YES,THIS IS A REAL SMARTPHONE WITH ALL NECESSARY FEATURE.I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR 2 WEEK AND I DIDN'T COME ACROSS EVEN A SMALLS LAG AT ANY POINT.COMING TO BATTERY LIFE,AS MANY PEOPLE ARE VERY SCEPTIC ABOUT THE BATTERY,BUT WITH ONE FULL CHARGE YOU CAN MANAGE UPTO ONE FULL DAY WITH NORMAL USAGE(OFCOURSE IT VARIES FROM PERSON TO PERSON).IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY A DECENT PHONE IN 23K PRICE BRACKET,THIS IS THE BEST PHONE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER."
Xperia P,4,"1. DESIGN IS REALY SLEEK, DOESNT FEEL BULKY AT ALL. SOMETIMES ITS VERTICAL ORIENTATION FEELS LITTLE SMALLER BUT YOU WILL GET USED TO IT. ICONS ARE REALLY VERY SMALL..KEYBOARD IS SMALL.. TYPING BECOMES SO TEDIOUS!
      
      2. AMOLED IN GRAND OR S II IS SURE A BRIGHTER DISPLAY BUT IMAGE IS MORE SHARPER IN P THANKS TO ITS PIXEL DENSITY WHICH IS PERFECT FOR A 4 INCH DISPLAY.
      
      3. FOR MEMORY, YOU CAN BUY A OTG USB CABLE FROM E BAY AND CAN USE PEN DRIVE AS A EXTERNAL STORAGE..IT WORKS REALLY WELL..
      
      4. CAMERA REALLY SUCKS I WAS EXPECTING A LOT FROM SONY BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED..
      
      5. MUSIC PLAYER IS AWESOME, ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE MARKET. HEADPHONES ARE AVERAGE BUT YOU CAN BUY ANYTHING FROM ONLINE MARKET FOR ITS REPLACEMENT.
      
      6. GAMING, MULTITASKING IS A FUN..IT DOESN'T HANG AT ALL. NO LAG WHATSOEVER."
Xperia P,4,"1. ITS PROPORTIONS ARE PLEASING. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO OTHERS WATCHING YOU TALK ON YOUR PHONE AS IF YOU ARE HOLDING A TV IN YOUR HAND.
      
      2. THE BATTERY IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE WHO USE THE PHONE. MAY NOT BE ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE WHO LET THEIR PHONE USE THEM.
      
      3. SINCE MY PURCHASE 4 MONTHS BACK, I HAVE DROPPED THE PHONE 4 TO 5 TIMES AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT FOR ME A COUPLE OF TIMES - NOT A SCRATCH. MAY BE I WAS JUST LUCKY.
      
      4. NOT SATISFIED WITH THE PC INTERFACE, THOUGH PICTURE TRANSFER IS FAST AND SMOOTH.
      
      5. THE BATTERY TEMP MAY RISE ONCE IN A WHILE DURING CHARGING OR GAMING. SO CHOOSE THE COLOUR BLACK - HIGHER COOEFICIENT OF EMMISIVITY"
Xperia P,4,"16 GB INTERNAL OF WHICH ONLY 13 GB AVAILABLE FOR US...I AM NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY SONY IS DOING THIS. IN SOME MODEL FRONT CAMERA MISSING , IN SOME MEMORY SLOT MISSING, IF ALL THIS AVAILABLE THEN PROCESSOR IS LACKING......I LIKE SONY PHONES VERY MUCH...PLZ SONY DON'T DISAPPOINT US"
Xperia P,4,"A VERY GOOD LOOKING PHONE, QUITE A HANDFUL TOO! WORKS PRETTY WELL FOR PHONE CALLS BUT IS SLOW FOR INTERNET USAGE ON 2G.( 3G SIGNALS WEAK IN MOST AREAS). PACKED WITH FEATURES, BUT USELESS IF USED ONLY AS A PHONE. LIKE USING A FERRARI FOR COMMUTING.
      
      BATTERY DRAIN IS COSIDERABLE (ALWAYS HAS BEEN IN SONY, REMEMBER K750I). I STUMBLED A GREAT APP IPMPLUS BATTERY SAVER LITE. AFTER INSTALLING THIS, THE BATTERY NOW LASTS ALMOST 2 TO 3 DAYS WITH MODERATE USE."
Xperia P,4,"AT THIS PRICE RANGE WITH A PLEASING DISPLAY RESOLUTION, DECENT MEMORY AND PROCESSING CAPABILITY, NICE CAMERA AND GOOD LOOK MAKES XPERIA P AN INTERESTING PURCHASE. BUT SADLY THOUGH THE BATTERY LIFE OF THIS FEATURE PACKED PHONE DOES NOT MATCH THE EXPECTATION OF A NOVICE USER LEAVE ASIDE THE ONES CONSTANTLY USING THE 3G FEATURES AND PLAYING GAMES. BATTERY DRAINS OUT ALMOST COMPLETELY WITH MODERATE 3G USAGE AND FEW MINUTES OF GAMING IN A DAY. RECHARGING AFTER YOU COME HOME FROM WORK IS MANDATORY. BUT IF ONE IS COMFORTABLE WITH PLUGGING THE PHONE EVERY TIME TO CHARGER WITHOUT FAIL THEN NO NECESSITY OF GIVING SECOND THOUGHTS ON WHICH PHONE TO PURCHASE."
Xperia P,4,"DESIGN: MIND BLOWING DESIGN. WHAT A SUPERB TEXTURE. I JUST LOVE THIS. NOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE: 1 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR WITH 1 GB RAM MAKES IT A REALLY FAST. 13 GB MEMORY FOR USER IS SUFFICIENT ENOUGH. IN FACT ITS GOOD TO HAVE AN INTERNAL MEMORY WHICH MAKES THE MEMORY ACCESS FAST AS COMPARED TO EXTERNAL SD CARD MEMORY. YOU CAN RUN AROUND 10 APPS AT A TIME WITHOUT HAVING ANY ISSUE. SUPERB MULTITASKING PHONE.
      
      BATTERY: BACK IS OKAY. I CHARGE IT IN THE MORNING AND IT LASTS TILL MID NIGHT. ALTHOUGH IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE USAGE.
      
      CAMERA: SONY. ONLY NAME IS ENOUGH. AWESOME PICTURE QUALITY IN DAY LIGHT. BUT IF YOU ARE CAPTURING IN DARK AREAS PICTURES ARE NOT UP TO THE MARK. THEY ARE OK-OK. SONY ITS NEEDS TO SHOW SOME IMPROVEMENTS.
      
      MUSIC: AFTER APPLE, SONY IS BEST.
      
      DISPLAY: BETTER THEN APPLE. NO ONE CAN BEAT BRAVIA ENGINE TECHNOLOGY. REAL CRISP..."
Xperia P,4,"FIRST THING YOU NOTICE WHEN YOU HOLD XPERIA P , YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THAT..
      
      
      ITS UNIQUE BODY DESIGN MAKES YOU FEEL PROUD THAT YOU ARE HOLDING REALLY SMART PHONE.
      
      
      COMING WHAT GUD WHAT NOT..
      
      
      1. PERFORMANCE :  VERY SPEED AND WONT TAKE MUCH TIME TO OPEN ANY APP.
      
      GAMING EXPERIENCE IS AWESOME.
      
      2. CAMERA       : IT WILL GIVE A RUN TO ALL YOUR DIGICAMS.
      
      EXCELLENT SNAPS .
      
      
      3. MUSIC &AMP; VIDEO :  MUSIC AS USUAL BEST BUT VIDEO RESOLUTION REALLY                       NICE, IT WILL PROVIDE HOME THEATER EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      REMAIN EVERYTHING FINE..
      
      
      WHAT NOT HOT :
      
      
      1. SPEAKER VOLUME :  IT IS LOW AND IF YOU ARE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC , YOU CANT HEAR OTHER PERSONS VOICE WITHOUT HEADSET.
      
      
      2.BATTERY :  OF COURSE, IT A ISSUE TO ALL ANDROID PHONES , I GUESS.
      
      
      YOU CAN GO FOR XPERIA P , FOR ITS STYLISH LOOK AND BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE."
Xperia P,4,GOT THIS PHONE 20 DAYS BACK.. IT IS JUST STUNNING... REALLY BEAUTIFUL... A REALLY HANDFULL PHONE... DOESNT HAVE THAT SLIPPERY  THING GOING ON WITH IT... THE DESIGN IS GOOD AND THE TRANSPERENT STRIP  MAKES THE PHONE LOOKS BETTER THAN THE OTHERS OF ITS KIND.... BUT.. I KNOW THERE IS ALWAYS A BUT IN EVERYTHING GOOD... NOTHING COME WITHOUT FLAWS... THE BATTERY IS LITTLE WEEAK FOR THIS PHONE... IF U CHARGE IT COMPLETELY IN THE MORNING.. AND U ARE ON THE INTERNET CONSTANTLY OR PLAYING GAMES OR LISTENING TO MUSIC.. THAN U WILL HAVE TO FOR SURE CHARGE IT AGAIN BY EVENING.... BUT.. AGAIN BUT.. THE GOOD THING IN THIS IS THAT... THE BATTERY CHARGES IN AN HOUR.. LIKE FROM DEAD (0%) TO COMPLETELY CHARGED (100%) IN AN HOUR... THE CAMERA QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD.. AND THE PICTURES EVEN LOOK REAL GOOD... THE VIDEO QUALITY IS ALSO REALLY GOOD... ALL IN ALL THE PHONE IS REALLY GOOD... AND IF U WANT TO BUY IT.. I WILL SURELY SAY GO AHEAD...
Xperia P,4,"HI ALL,
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS MOBILE FOR NEARLY ONE WEEK FROM NOW, I FEEL REALLY AWESOME WITH IT IN MY HANDS NOW. EVEN MY FRIENDS WHO ARE ALL USING SAMSUNG SAID THAT MY MOBILE IS GREAT.
      
      
      THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS, THAT THE HEADSETS COMES WITH THIS BOX HAS ONLY PLAY AND PAUSE BUTTON, SHOULD HAVE NEXT, PREVIOUS BUTTONS ALSO. BUT ITS NOT A BIG DEAL."
Xperia P,4,"I AM A SONY FAN, USED W810 FOR 4 YEARS, THEN CEDAR J108I FOR 8-9 MONTHS AND THEN OPTED FOR THIS HEADACHE.
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS XPERIA SET SINCE AUG 2012.
      
      
      PLEASE NOTE THIS HANDSET IS BEAUTIFUL BY LOOKS AND PERFORMANCE AS WELL IN MANY ASPECTS. BUT TIME IS ONLY MATTER TO LOVE/HATE THIS HANDSET.
      
      
      MAJOR DISADVANTAGES OF THIS HANDSET,
      
      1. BATTERY LIFE: ~1350 MAH BATTERY IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. YOU NEED TO CHARGE IT 2-3 TIMES A DAY IF YOU HAVE TO DO VOICE/VIDEO CHAT OR WI-FI/3G ACCESS.
      
      
      2. CHARGER CABLE: ORIGINAL CHARGER CABLE IS TOO SHORT, YOU MAY FACE CHARGING ISSUE ALMOST ALL PLACES. STILL YOU CAN EXTEND IT USING USB F-F CABLE. BUT EXTENSION CABLE SHOULD BE HAVING 1-2FT IN LENGTH, ELSE YOUR CELL WILL NOT CHARGE ITS BATTERY (IT'LL JUST SHOW YOU ABOUT CHARGING). SONY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS EXTENSION.
      
      
      3) 3G VIDEO CALLING: THERE IS NO 3G VIDEO CALLING SUPPORTED IN THIS HANDSET, ACTUALLY IN MANY XPERIA HANDSETS ITS NOT AVAILABLE. I FORGOT TO GOOGLE THIS BEFORE PLACING ORDER.
      
      YOU CAN USE GTALK/SKYPE VIDEO CHAT AS ALTERNATE - WHICH IS ALSO GREAT OPTION, BUT NO 3G VIDEO CALLING.
      
      
      4) TIMESCAPE: THIS IS BEST FEATURE OF XPERIA, BUT IF YOU CONFIGURE YOUR FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN AND TWITTER ACCOUNTS, THEN YOU SHOULD FIND ACTUAL BEHAVIOR OF 1 GHZ DUAL CORE WITH 1GB RAM SIMILAR TO PENTIUM 386/486 ERA CPU WITH 16/32MB RAM WINDOWS PC.
      
      
      5) HANGING ISSUE: OS WITH 2.3.7 WAS VERY MUCH FAMILIAR WITH HANGING ISSUE, ITS ALMOST RESOLVED IN ICS. BUT SPEED OF GUI IS REDUCED IN ICS. GUI'S REDUCED SPEED IS MUCH MORE CONSIDERABLE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO ROLLBACK TO GINGERBREAD, AS IT WAS HANGING - SPECIALLY CAMERA REGULARLY USED TO GIVE ERROR AS ""CAMERA ERROR"".
      
      
      6) BROWSER ISSUE: IF YOU ARE FIREFOX FAN, THEN ITS NOT SO GOOD NEWS FOR FF LOVERS, KEYPAD DROPS SUPPORT AT ALMOST MANY TIMES IN FIREFOX. I THINK WE CAN PREVENT GOOGLE ADS IN FIREFOX, SO ANDROID IS NOT SO MUCH SUPPORTING ITS BROWSER RIVAL. ANDROID'S IN-BUILT BROWSER IS NOT GIVING ANY OPTION TO ADD ADD-ONS OR TO REMOVE ADS FROM ITS ADVT FILLED BROWSER.
      
      
      OVERALL, GREAT PHONE WITH GTALK VIDEO CALLING OPTION, GREAT DISPLAY WITH BRAVIA ENGINE, BUILD QUALITY &AMP; NICE LOOK AS WELL - MINUS ABOVE ISSUES FACED BY ME.
      
      
      GUYS TAKE RIGHT DECISION, I WAS NOT SO MUCH LUCKY TO KNOW ABOVE FACTS BEFORE PLACING ORDER. I AM WAITING FOR XPERIA ACRO HD/S - TILL THAT TIME NEED TO SARIDON THIS!"
Xperia P,4,"I BOUGHT IT OUTSIDE FLIPKART.I ALWAYS WANTED A SONY MOBILE BECOS OF ITS LOOK,FEEL,MUSIC AND CAMERA.
      
      I WAS LOOKING FOR U/SOLA BUT THE SCREEN SIZE WERE LESS.I WANTED A ~4"" SCREEN.SO THE RANGE KEPT ON INCRESING AND I BOUGHT THIS FOR 23K.
      
      THE PHONE PERFORMS WELL WITH DUAL CORE.HD VIDEOS ARE DELIGHT TO WATCH AND CAMERA IS 8MP SO NO QUESTION ABT PIC CLARITY EVEN AT 6MP.MUSIC IS AWESOME AND IN HEADPHONES ITS UNCOMPARABLE.IF YOU ARE USING 3G THEN YOU WILL NEVER USE YOUR LAPTOP AGAIN.
      
      WHITEMAGIC IS MAGIC ALSO BUT IT DRAINS BATTERY.
      
      
      THERE ARE OTHER HANDSETS CHEAPER THAN SONY P BUT I WANTED A SONY."
Xperia P,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN JUNE FROM SONY INDIA SHOP DIRECTLY. THIS IS MY SECOND ANDROID PHONE AFTER A VERY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE WITH HTC SENSATION, WHICH HAD MAJOR NETWORK CONNECTIVITY ISSUES. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PHONE I BUY DOES NOT HAVE ANY NETWORK RELATED ISSUES.
      
      
      AFTER GOING THROUGH A LOT OF REVIEWS OF MANY DIFFERENT MODELS (EXCLUDING HTC), I WAS INTERESTED IN THIS MODEL. THE WHITEMAGIC TECHNOLOGY WAS WHAT INTERESTED ME INITIALLY AND BESIDES IT SEEMED GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY. THE BUILD IS GOOD, THE ALUMINIUM BODY HAS A PREMIUM FEEL (BETTER THAN XPERIA S), THE SPECS ARE FINE FOR MY NORMAL USAGE AND I DON?T FIND ANY LAG. IT HAS GOT GOOD NETWORK CONNECTIVITY COVERAGE. THE DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD WITH GOOD VIEWING ANGLES. THE WHITE MAGIC TECHNOLOGY REALLY WORKS AND EVEN IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT, CAN SEE THE SCREEN PROPERLY. THE TEXT DISPLAY IS VERY CRISP THANKS TO THE HIGH PPI. THE CAMERA AND VIDEO RECORDING IS GOOD. IT HAS A GOOD MUSIC PLAYER WITH LOT OF SETTINGS.
      
      
      GOT THE PHONE UPGRADED TO THE ICS VERSION IN AUGUST. A PRIOR UPGRADE HAD CAUSED SOME ISSUES WHICH WERE ALL FIXED IN THE ICS UPGRADE. SONY'S CUSTOMIZATION OF ICS IS NOT HEAVY AND THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE HAS IMPROVED FURTHER.
      
      
      THE ONLY NEGATIVE I CAN TALK ABOUT IS THAT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AVERAGE AT BEST. WISH THE CAPACITY WAS MORE THAN 1305 MAH. THE CHARGING IS VERY FAST THOUGH."
Xperia P,4,"I READ IT SOMEWHERE THIS ONE HAS NO EXTERNAL MEMORY CARD SLOT...(CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG) BUT WHAT IF I NEED IT?
      
      I AGREE 16GB IS QUITE A LOT OF MEMORY FOR A PHONE THOUGH...
      
      
      I AM CURRENTLY HUNTING FOR A GOOD PHONE TO HAVE....I LIKE XPERIA SERIES. I LIKE THEIR FRONT DESIGN, BUT THE BACK IS WHAT IS DISAPPOINTING ME IN MOST OF THEM. I WISH THEY WEREN'T CURVED. BUT THAT IS SUBJECTIVE. MAY BE OTHERS LIKE IT THAT WAY."
Xperia P,4,"IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE TO USE ANDROID PHONE FOR FIRST TIME. I WAS ASTONISHED BY THE BRIGHT CLEAR DISPLAY AND AMAZING ""SONY"" SOUND.
      
      THE PHONE IS ALL GOOD AND A BEST BUY EXCEPT FOR A FEW GLITCHES:
      
      BATTERY...IF YOU HAVE A DATA PACK ENABLED...THAT CONTINUOUSLY RUNS THE SYSTEM FOR REGULAR UPDATES, YOUR BATTERY IS DRAINED WITHIN 2 DAYS WITHOUT EVEN A SINGLE CALL.
      
      OLD VERSION OF ANDROID(2.3)... A CONSTANT REMINDER FOR UPGRADE IRRITATES ME, BUT I DON'T UPGRADE COZ OF ISSUES WITH THE UPGRADED VERSION ON THIS PHONE
      
      BUT AS I AM A SONY FREAK, SO THESE STUFF DON'T WORRY ME MUCH, I LOVE OWNING A SONY. REST IS UPTO YOU :)"
Xperia P,4,"IT'S BEEN 7 DAYS SINCE I STARTED USING THE SONY XPERIA P. PREVIOUSLY I HAD A HTC DESIRE S. SO I AM GIVING MY REVIEW BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE ON BOTH THE MOBILE PHONES.
      
      
      DISPLAY - BOTH DEVICES HAVE HAVE GREAT DISPLAY. I WOULD GIVE AN EXTRA POINT TO XPERIA P.
      
      UI - HTC SENSE IS INCOMPARABLE. THOUGH SONY'S TIMESCAPE IS GOOD ENOUGH BUT HTC SENSE IS THE WINNER BETWEEN THEM.
      
      CAMERA - SONY IS THE CLEAR WINNER IN THIS SECTION. NOTHING TO COMPARE.
      
      MEMORY - XPERIA P IS HAVING 16GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND THERE IS NO SD CARD SLOT PRESENT. OUT OF WHICH A LITTLE MORE THAN 13 GB(1.97GB FOR APPS AND 11.26 GB FOR MEDIA STORAGE) IS AVAILABLE FOR THE USER. WHICH IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR ANY USER IN REAL TIME. BUT HTC DESIRE S HAS 1.1 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND A SD CARD SLOT WHICH IS EXPANDABLE UP TO 64 GB. SO I THINK HTC IS BETTER IN THIS CASE.
      
      AUDIO - THOUGH THE QUALITY OF AUDIO IS SAME IN BOTH THE DEVICES, BUT HTC IS MORE LOUD AND CLEAR THAN SONY. THE HEAD PHONE PROVIDED BY HTC IS FAR SUPERIOR THAN SONY. LIKE SO MANY OTHER USERS I AM ALSO NOT SURE WHY SONY HAS GIVEN THAT X-LOUD FEATURE. IT IS OF NO USE. WHETHER YOU ACTIVATE IT OR DEACTIVATE IT YOU WILL FIND NO CHANGE AT ALL.
      
      BATTERY - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR WHEN DECIDING TO BUY A SMART PHONE. NO ANDROID PHONE IN THIS WORLD HAS A VERY GOOD BATTERY LIFE. BUT SONY IN THIS FIELD REALLY HAVE TO SPEND A LOT IN THE R&AMP;D. THE BATTERY IN XPERIA P IS 1300 MAH BATTERY WHICH REALLY SUCKS. THE BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY VERY POOR. A FULLY CHARGED BATTERY WILL ONLY LAST FOR NO LONGER THAN A DAY. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO IN THE PHONE IT WILL DRAIN OUT WITHIN A DAY. EVEN IF YOU DON'T DO ANY THING WITH THE PHONE, KEEP THE DATA, WIFI, MUSIC, CAMERA, LIVE WALLPAPER OFF, IT WILL DRAIN OUT WITHIN 24 HOURS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND SONY WHAT IS KEEPING THEM OFF FROM INCREASING THE POWER OF THE BATTERY.
      
      
      SO FRIENDS, ALL IN ALL THE PHONE IS A GOOD BUY ONLY IF YOU ARE READY TO COMPROMISE WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BATTERY.
      
      
      THANK YOU ALL."
Xperia P,4,"I'VE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND I'M POSTING MY REVIEW FOR XPERIA P. IT COULD EASILY BE ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING PHONE IN THE MARKET. I MUST APPRECIATE DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY OF XPERIA P. IT HAS ALUMINIUM UNIBODY, TRANSPARENT STRIP WITH TOUCH BUTTONS ON IT, CURVY BACK.
      
      
      PROS -
      
      &GT; GREAT LOOKS AND BUILD QUALITY
      
      &GT; LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMPACT; ONLY 120 G
      
      &GT; DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, 1 GB RAM ARE ENOUGH TO HANDLE MOST OF THE GAMES
      
      &GT; BRIGHTEST DISPLAY YOU WILL EVER SEE
      
      &GT; QHD SCREEN RESOLUTION WITH AMAZING DISPLAY QUALITY
      
      &GT; COLORS LOOK VIVID AND TEXT LOOK SO SHARP
      
      &GT; SUPERB AUDIO QUALITY THANKS TO WALKMAN APPLICATION; BETTER THAN IPOD ACCORDING TO ME.
      
      &GT; 4 INCH DISPLAY SIZE FEELS JUST PERFECT
      
      &GT; MINIMALISTIC USER INTERFACE
      
      &GT; SUPPORT FOR FLAC; REALLY WELCOME FEATURE FOR AUDIOPHILE
      
      &GT; NFC, HDMI OUT, FULL HD VIDEO RECORDING, 3D SWEEP PANORAMA ARE OTHER NOTABLE FEATURES
      
      
      CONS -
      
      &GT; BLACK LEVELS ARE POORLY RENDERED, CONTRAST RATIO COULD HAVE BEEN ENHANCED
      
      &GT; POOR BATTERY LIFE; SONY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER HERE
      
      &GT; ALTHOUGH IT CARRIES 8MP CAMERA, PICTURE QUALITY IS NOT UPTO THE MARK; NOWHERE NEAR THEIR OWN STANDARDS
      
      &GT; BACK OF PHONE FEELS LITTLE SLIPPERY AND SOMETIMES I FEAR IF IT SLIPS FROM MY HAND
      
      &GT; VIEWING ANGLE OF DISPLAY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
      
      &GT; NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY, ALTHOUGH 13 GB USER ACCESSIBLE MEMORY WOULD SUFFICE MOST OF THE BUYERS
      
      &GT; POSITION OF POWER BUTTON COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
      
      
      IF YOU WANT TO HAVE GOOD LOOKING PHONE WITH DECENT CONFIGURATION, THEN GO FOR IT. IT WON'T LET YOU DOWN."
Xperia P,4,"LIKES: SONY WHITE MAGIC IS REALLY COOL, 8MP REAR CAMERA, XLOUD MUSIC AND GOOD FORM FACTOR.
      
      DISLIKES : NON-EXPANDABLE MEMORY SLOT. BUT IT DOESN'T BOTHER MUCH. SINCE THE INTERNAL 12GB USER ACCESSIBLE MEMORY IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR ME.
      
      VERDICT : ITS A VFM. IT WILL BE STEAL, IF THE PRICE REDUCES FURTHER. NO NEED TO THINK OF CHANGING MY MOBILE FOR NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS."
Xperia P,4,"OWNING THIS PHONE IS REALLY GREAT . GREAT PROCESSING GREAT GRAPHICS GREAT CAMERA GREAT SOUND
      
      BUT ONLY PROBLEM ARISES IS THE BATTERY . BATTERY BACKUP IS UNSATISFACTORY WE HAVE TO CHARGE IT TWICE A DAY SUMTYMS THRICE ALSO BUT STILL ITS AWESOME"
Xperia P,4,"PLEASE NOTE I WROTE THIS REVIEW AFTER UPDATING TO ICS(6.1.1.B.1.54)
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 8 DAYS BACK . PRETTY SATISFIED WITH THE FLIPKART SERVICE .
      
      PROS
      
      1.ZIPPY DUAL CORE 1GHZ PROCESSOR , WHICH IS BACKED BY A GIG OF RAM , WHICH ENABLES THE PHONE TO PERFORM DAY-TO-DAY TASK EASILY
      
      2.A BEAUTIFUL AND A PRETTY NICE TIMESCAPE UI OVER THE PHONE
      
      3.WHEN PHOTOS ARE CLICKED OUTDOOR , THE QUALITY OF THE PHOTO IS WELL ABOVE AVERAGE
      
      4.WHITEMAGIC TECHNOLOGY ENSURES AN ELEGANT BRIGHTNESS AND MAKES THE SCREEN CLEARLY VISIBLE IN HEAVY SUNLIGHT.
      
      5.1080P(FULL HD) VIDEOS PLAY WITHOUT A HICCUP
      
      6.CALL QUALITY IS PRETTY DESCENT
      
      7.SPEAKERS ARE LOUD ENOGH
      
      CONS.
      
      1.WHEN PHOTOS ARE TAKEN IN INDOOR LIGHT , THE PHOTO IS HALF BLACK AND HALF WHITE . IT'S A SHAME THAT SONY HASN'T FIXED THE ISSUE YET.
      
      2.BATTERY DRAIN IS QUICK . IF YOU ARE A HEAVY USER , THEN YOU MAY CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE .HOWEVER IT'S NOT A DEAL BREAKER FOR NORMAL USERS AND NEITHER FOR THE HEAVY USERS :)
      
      3.STORAGE IS LIMITED TO 16 GBS . HOWEVER , ONE CAN EXPAND IT BY CONNECTING A STORAGE DEVICE THROUGH USB OTG CABLE .
      
      4.I DON'T KNOW IF IT OCCURS IN MY HANDSET - FILES/APP EXCEEDING 150MB DOESN'T INSTALL . I FIRST CAME ACROSS THIS WHEN I TRIED TO UPDATE MY PHONE FROM GB TO ICS . THE UPDATE AFTER BEING COMPLETED TO 100% , STARTED TO REDOWNLOAD . THE SAME HAPPENS TO THE APPS IN PLAY STORE .
      
      5.LIVE WALLPAPERS , PARTICULARLY COSMIC FLOW LAGS"
Xperia P,4,"SONY XPERIA P IS DEFINITELY GOING IN THE COMPETITION ON UPPER SIDE FROM SAMSUNG ,,,THIS A IS A NICE CANDY PIECE TO HOLD ON FEELS SMOOTH AND CRISPY, EXTRA BRIGHT THOUGH NOT LIKE SAMSUNG GALAXY S2 EXTRA BRIGHT SCRREN RENDERS VERY NICE LIVE COLORS. WATCHING VIDEOS IS A PLEASURE ON IT AND IT IS THE SIZE JUST PERFECT TO HOLD IN YOUR JEANS ,,DUAL CORE IS REALLY FAST BOOTS UP 2 TIMES FASTER THEN XPERIA ARC,,ITS DEFINITELY A GREAT BUYY,,ONLY CONS.. IS THE BATTERY LIFE SO DOWNLOAD A BATTERY SAVER FROM GOOGLE PLAY IT WILL DOUBLE YOUR BATTERY LIFE..APART"
Xperia P,4,"THE ONLY REASON WHY SAMSUNG  GALAXY PHONES / GRAND DUOS ETC SCORES ON THIS PHONE IS THE X FACTOR ''THE SAR VALUE'' WHICH IS 2X OR 3X TIMES HIGHER IN SONY XPERIA FONES... REALLY HOPING SONY WILL TRY REDUCING THAT SOON, NOW THAT EVERYBODY IS GETTING CONSCIOUS REGARDING THE HEALTH IMPACT OF RADIATION....
      
      SO 1 STAR OFF FOR THE SAME..."
Xperia P,4,"THE PHONE HAS STUNNING VISUALS. I MEAN, AFTER USING THIS PHONE, SAMSUNG GALAXY LOOKS AMATEURISH, ATLEAST IN DISPLAY RESOLUTION. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 2 MONTHS...FINGERS CROSSED..IT DIDNT HANG...
      
      
      BUT IF THERE ARE CONS, THERE ARE 2...
      
      1. THE HEADPHONE IS NOT A GLIDE-IN EARPHONE. ITS THE SAME OL EARPHONE. YOU WOULD EXPECT SONY WOULD TAKE SPECIAL CARE ABOUT IT, SINCE THE COMPETITOR HTC, HAS INTRODUCED BEATS HARDWARE.
      
      2. THE BATTERY, THOUGH IT IS A COMMON BONE OF CONTENTION AMONG SMARTPHONE USERS. BUT MY LAST PHONE WAS NOKIA. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TRANSITION.
      
      
      EXCEPT FOR THESE 2 POINTS, I HAVE NO OTHER COMPLAINTS. RECOMMENDED !!"
Xperia P,4,"USING IT SINCE ONE MONTH
      
      ADVANTAGES:
      
      1. 4 INCH IS THE RIGHT SIZE FOR ONE HANDED USE.
      
      2. VERY BRIGHT SCREEN THANKS TO WHITEMAGIC
      
      3. AWESOME CAMERA WITH FULLHD RECORDING
      
      4. NFC
      
      5. NO HANGING ISSUES SO FAR WHILE PLAYING GAMES
      
      6. MUSIC QUALITY IS VERY GOOD. CAN PLAY 1024P VIDEOS
      
      7. PROMISED JELLYBEAN UPDATE
      
      
      DISADVANTAGES:
      
      IT WAS A BATTERY DRAINER FOR INITIAL 2-3 DAYS BUT AFTER THAT IT SETTLED DOWN. MAKE SURE YOU RECHARGE FOR 8-10HRS BEFORE FIRST USE. ALSO USE IT FOR COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE JUMPING TO ANY CONCLUSION. WITH INTERNET ACTIVE(NO EMAIL SYNCING THOUGH), DISPLAY IN POWER SAVER, AND EXTENDED MODE TURNED ON IT COMES FOR 10-12HRS. SO YOU HAVE TO CHARGE IT TWICE A DAY. I HOPE SONY WILL RELEASE A HIGH RATED BATTERY FOR THIS PHONE. GIVING 4 STAR FOR THIS REASON."
Xperia P,4,"XPERIA P IS AN EXCELLENT PHONE WITH ALL THE FEATURES.
      
      PROCESSOR IS VERY GOOD AND RAM OF 1 GB IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.
      
      CAMERA IS VERY GOOD..BUT CAPTURING IN LOW LIGHT COULD BE BETTER.
      
      ALL FEATURES ARE EXCELLENT EXCEPT BATTERY LIFE."
Xperia P,4,"XPERIA P IS ONE OF THE BEST MODEL IN SONY,&AMP; I USED AND SAYING.
      
      
      ADV:       MODEL: WONDERFUL
      
      PPI: 275 CRISP IMAGES
      
      UI: EXCELLENT
      
      NEW TEC: WHITE MAGIC

      2. MEMORY IT HAS 12GB INTERNAL MEMORY &AMP; 1.80GB PHONE MEMORY.
      
      
      THANK YOU."
Xperia P,3,"BOUGHT A SONY XPERIA P YESTERDAY FROM FLIPKART. FEEDBACK ON THE FEATURES EXPLORED ARE:
      
      
      1. SUPERB DISPLAY RESOLUTION.
      
      2. BATTERY IS SEALED. SO SONY'S INTENTION MIGHT BE TO CHARGE 3000-5000 RUPEES WHEN IT GETS DAMAGED AS THE USER CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITH THE BATTERY.
      
      3. GOOD SOUND QUALITY BUT QUITE LOW.
      
      4. FM OPERATION LOOKED TO BE VERY NICE TO ME.
      
      5. A TRADITIONAL PROBLEM WITH SONY : I TRIED 3 DIFFERENT VIDEO FILES WHICH RUNS IN MY SAMSUMG 32 INCH TV.
      
      A) FILE 1 (MKV) WAS PLAYED NICELY UPTO CERTAIN TIME. AFTER THAT IT SAID ""CANNOT PLAY"".
      
      B) FILE 2 (MP4) WAS NOT PLAYED AT ALL. MESSAGE IS ""CANNOT PLAY""
      
      C) FILE 3 (MKV) - VIDEO WAS PLAYED, BUT NO AUDIO.
      
      SO BE AWARE. EXPECT THAT ONLY SOME VIDEO FILES WITH MATAJI'S BLESSINGS CAN BE PLAYED ON XPERIA.
      
      6. ALTHOUGH CLAIMED TO BE 4 INCH, SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE LESS WIDTH COMPARED TO SAMSUNG GALAXY S I9000 WHICH IS ALSO SAID TO BE 4 INCH.
      
      7. IT ACCEPTS MICRO-SIM WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN INDIAN MARKET, AT LEAST I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. HAD TO CUT THE SIM WITH A SCISSOR.
      
      8. BACKUP TIME IS UNBELIEVABLY POOR. (I HAVE A SAMSUNG GALAXY S I9000, SO I AM AWARE THAT BATTERY IN ANDROID IS AN ISSUE BUT THIS ONE IS TERRIBLE.)
      
      9. TOUCH SENSE DID NOT MAKE ME HAPPY BUT CAN LIVE WITH IT.
      
      
      FLIPKART SERVICE WAS SUPERB. HOWEVER, THIS PRODUCT IS ENOUGH TO SPOIL MY MOOD PRIMARILY DUE TO POINT 2, 5 &AMP; 7."
Xperia P,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT 10 MONTHS NOW AND ALL I CAN SAY THAT ITS JUST AN AVERAGE SMART PHONE.
      
      FIRST THE PROS:
      
      -UPGRADING IT TO ANDROID V 4.0 HAS MADE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY.
      
      -THE 16GB INTERNAL MEMORY IS GOOD ENOUGH TO STORE YOUR DATA.
      
      -IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND FITS IN THE HAND EASILY AND IS NOT AT ALL BULKY.
      
      -I LISTEN TO MAINLY POP, ROCK AND DUBSTEP AND I FIND THE SPEAKERS AND THE VOLUME ADEQUATE.
      
      -THE SECONDARY CAMERA IS SOMETIMES USEFUL FOR VIDEO CHAT USING SKYPE/TANGO.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      - THOUGH IT HAS A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR BUT ITS A BIT SLOW AND HANGS A LOT. BECAUSE OF THIS I HAVE TO RESTART IT MORE THAN USUAL WHICH IS A BIT ANNOYING.
      
      - I FELT THE TOUCH SCREEN IS A BIT LACKING IN QUALITY AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE RECEPTIVE.
      
      -THE CAMERA COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WHEN CLICKING PHOTOS BUT IT COMPENSATES WHEN TAKING A VIDEO.
      
      -THE BATTERY DOESNT LAST THE WHOLE DAY WITH THE WIFI CONTINUOUSLY ON SO I  SOMETIMES HAVE TO CHARGE IT BY EARLY EVENING.
      
      
      AS A GREAT FAN OF SONY PRODUCTS, HAVING OWNED SONY TVS, DSLR'S AND LAPTOPS, I WAS ACTUALLY DISAPPOINTED FROM THIS PRODUCT. FRANKLY SPEAKING, THERE ARE OTHER GREAT SMART PHONES FROM HTC/NOKIA. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE 25000 THAT I SPENT."
Xperia P,3,"I HAVE SEEN XPERIA P AT A RETAIL STORE AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT SPEAKER SOUND IS VERY LOUSY AND NOT LOUD ENOUGH. YOU CAN'T HEAR RINGING TONE IN LOUD ENVIRONMENT. OTHERWISE, SCREEN IS THE BEST PART OF THE PHONE, IT IS BETTER THAN OPTIMUS BLACK. IF YOU WANT SUNLIGHT LEGIBLE SCREEN, EXPANDABLE MEMORY, GREAT SPEAKER FOR LESS THAN 25000, OPTIMUS BLACK IS THE ONE (ALTHOUGH ANDROID ICS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS).  WAIT FOR SOMETIME TILL PRICE OF XPERIA P FALLS BELOW 20K.  AT THIS POINT, LG OPTIMUS BLACK IS A BETTER PURCHASE THAN XPERIA"
Xperia P,3,"OVERALL THE PHONE IS DECENT. THE SCREEN CLARITY IS GOOD AND ALSO IT FEELS QUITE GOOD TO HOLD WITH THE NICE METAL BODY. WISH THE EDGES WERE A BIT MORE ROUNDED OFF AS DURING A DROP THE SHARP EDGES ARE NOT SO RESISTANT TO BREAKAGE.
      
      
      THE SORE ISSUE IS WITH THE BATTERY. NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY, THE BATTERY IS USELESS. IF YOU KEEP DATA OFF FOR THE DAY, IT WILL EASILY RUN FOR 1 AND A HALF DAYS. IF DATA IS KEPT ON THROUGHOUT THEN HALF A DAY TOPS. SONY HAVE INCLUDED CERTAIN FEATURES WHICH WILL CUT OFF DATA ONCE THE SCREEN IS OFF BUT EVEN WITH THAT FEATURE YOUR PHONE WILL CONK OFF BY EVENING 8 ISH..
      
      
      I HAVE THE LATEST FIRMWARE INSTALLED BUT ITS NOT OF MUCH HELP. IF I USE GPS AND A WATCH YOU TUBE FOR 15 TO 20 MINS, THE PHONE WONT EVEN LAST HALF A DAY!
      
      
      IF YOU HAVE A POWER SOURCE ATTACHED THEN THIS PHONE IS BRILLIANT WITH ITS CRISP SHARP DISPLAY AND NICE ERGONOMICS."
Xperia P,3,"THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE CELL'S LOOK IS GOOD AND PRICING AS PER SONY PRODUCT IS ALSO OK BUT A FEW THINGS WHICH I AM NOTICING
      
      1. SIGNAL PROBLEM IN THE AREAS WHERE OTHER SYMBIAN PHONES ARE EXCELLENT
      
      2. BATTERY DISCHARGES IN 12 HOURS EVEN IF I DO NOT USE APPLICATIONS
      
      3. IT BLINKS, HANGS, AND......
      
      4. I SHOWED IT IN SERVICE CENTRE AT JAIPUR TODAY BUT THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS."
Xperia P,3,"THIS PHONE HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL IF REDUCED THE PRICE RANGE BY 2.5K BUT ITS NOT WORTH BUYING FOR 20.9K
      
      WELL I WILL LIST SOME PROS AND CONS
      
      PROS-
      
      GREAT 8MP CAMERA
      
      1GIG RAM
      
      BRAVIA ENGINE - THE ONLY THING THAT SHOULD MAKE YOU CONSIDER BUYING IT
      
      A GREAT RESOLUTION - 960X540 WHICH IS PERFECT FOR A 4 INCH SCREEN
      
      MALI 400 - NOTE - PLEASE DON'T GET MISGUIDED BY A FANBOY WHO HAS SAID THAT IT HAS THE SAME GPU AS SGSII,ITS WRONG SGSII HAS MALI 400MP WHILE THIS PHONE JUST HAS MALI 400.MALI 400MP IS AN ADVANCED VERSION OF THE OLDER MALI 400.BUT STILL MALI 400 IS A GREAT GPU AND SHOULD GIVE YOU DECENT SPEED IN GAMES LIKE GTA 3 AND MAX PAYNE
      
      
      NOW ITS TIME FOR SOME CONS
      
      CONS -
      
      YOU DON'T GET OUT OF THE BOX ICS.I KNOW YOU DONT GET IT WITH THE COMPETITION EITHER BUT THE POINT IS BEING BETTER THAN THE COMPETITION NOT SIMILIAR IS IT ?
      
      LOW BATTERY LIFE
      
      NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY - BIGGEST DOWNER
      
      TIMESCAPE UI - THE ICONS ARE SMALL,VERY CLOSE TOGETHER NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH BIG FINGERS.ISN'T EXACTLY THE MOST PLEASANT THING TO LOOK AT.WHOEVER SAID THAT TIMESCAPE IS BETTER THAN TOUCHWIZ NEEDS TO LOOK UP TECH SURVEYS ON THE NET.
      
      TOUCHWIZ AND SENSE OUTCLASS TIMESCAPE.
      
      
      NOTES
      
      LOW BATTERY LIFE EXPLANATION GIVEN BY REVIEWERS ? - FROM WHERE EXACTLY DO YOU GET THE FACT THAT U8500 IS THE MOST POWER EFFICIENT CHIPSET .IT IS A COLOSSAL CHIP EVEN MENTIONED IN THE FLIPKART DESCRIPTION AND BRAVIA ENGINE AND WHITE MAGIC DRAIN MORE AND MORE BATTERY.
      
      ANOTHER BASELESS FACT WAS THE DISPLAY OF XPERIA P BEING 3X BETTER THAN SGSII ?
      
      SUPER AMOLED STOMPS BRAVIA ENGINE AND WHITE MAGIC TOGETHER.YOU CAN CHECK FOR YOURSELF BY COMPARING A SUPER AMOLED PHONE TO BRAVIA ENGINE SIDE BY SIDE.
      
      THANK YOU FOR READING."
Xperia P,1,"... IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE STUCK WITH OLD SOFTWARE ON YOUR PHONES. THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR ENTIRE 2011 LIMEUP OF PHONES WON'T BE UPGRADED TO ANDROID 4.1 JELLYBEAN (THESE PHONES ARE NOT EVEN 2 YEARS OLD AND ARE STILL BEING SOLD). THEY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT FIRST QUARTER 2013 AS A TARGET DATE FOR UPGRADING THE XPERIA T TO 4.1 (4.1 HAS ALREADY BEEN OUT FOR A FEW MONTHS! BUT HAVE GIVEN NO TARGET DATE FOR XPERIA P, I CAN ONLY ASSUME IT WILL BE LATER THAN 1Q 2013. CONSIDERING THE PRIMARY ROLE THAT SOFTWARE PLAYS ON MODERN PHONES, THEIR DECISION SHOWS SCANT CONCERN FOR EXISTING CUSTOMERS. BETTER TO GO WITH A BRAND THAT HAS A BETTER RECORD OF PROVIDING UPDATES FOR THEIR OLD PHONES."
Xperia P,1,"BATTERY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I JUST GOT MY NEW XPERIA P ONE WEEK BACK.. I MUST SAY BATTERY IS VERY VERY WEAK. I USED THE PHONE JUST FOR SOME MESSAGES AND PHONE CALLS AND IN NO TIME BATTERY DRAINS . THIS IS TOO MUCH. EVEN WHEN THE PHONE IS IDLE THE BATTERY DRAINS (LIKE WHEN I GO TO SLEEP IT IS 100 % , MORNING WHEN I GET UP ITS ONLY 54%...WHAT THE HELL??????????????????)
      
      
      I REQUEST SONY TO PLEASE CHANGE THE BATTERY OF THIS PHONE... THIS IS SOMETHING SERIOUS . OR ELSE DAY THE IS NEAR COMING WHEN CUSTOMERS WILL LOSE TRUST IN SONY. PLEASE ACT NOW AS YOU GUYS ARE JUST COMING BACK TO THE MARKET WITH SUCH WONDERFUL FEATURES PHONE(BUT VERY VERY POOR BATTERY LIFE:( )"
Xperia P,1,"HELLO, I ADMIT THAT SONY XPERIA P JUST A COOL PHONE BUT NOT SO GOOD, ACTUALLY THIS PHONE HAS SOME PROBLEM REGARDING ITS PROCESSING AND SOFTWARE. SOME TIMES ITS PROCESSING BECOME TOO SLOW ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DOWNLOAD OR RUN ANY GOOD APPLICATION. AND ITS SOFTWARE ARE REMOVE AUTOMATICALLY. THEREFORE I DON'T THINK SO ITS A GOOD PHONE. AND ITS CEMRA QUALITY IS NOT GOOD AS COMPARE ANY SAMSUNG SMARTPHONE PHONE. MY THREE FRIENDS ARE FEEL SO GUILTY AFTER PURCHASED THIS PHONE AND THEY ARE WANT TO SELL IT QUICKLY."
Xperia P,1,I BOUGHT SONY XPERIA P ON JUNE 10TH. AFTER 1 WEEK I FOUND THAT WATER PARTICLE IS ENTERING INTO THE TRANSPARENT STRIP BELOW THE SCREEN. SO I WENT TO THE SERVICE CENTER THEY TOLD XPERIA P AND U HAVING THESE PROBLEM . SO THEY SEND TO REPLACEMENT AFTER 2 WEEK I GOT ANOTHER USED PHONE HAVING LOT OF SCRATCHES . SO I DINT RECEIVE IT. STILL I M WAITING FOR MY ORIGINAL PHONE. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH SERVICE CENTER.
Xperia P,1,"I HAVE USED ALMOST ALL ANDROID PHONE BUT TWO EVER WORST ANDROID PHONES I HAVE EVER USED IS SONY XPERIA P &AMP; SAMSUNG GALAXY S2.
      
      SONY XPERIA P IS NOT WORTH A 20K PHONE ITS BETTER TO BUY A SONY LIVE WITH WALKMAN COMPARE TO THIS I KNOW SONY XPERIA P HAS A BRAVIA ENGINE DISPLAY A 16 GB INTERNAL MEMORY BUT ITS NOT EXPANDABLE NEITHER THE BATTERY IS REMOVABLE WORST BATTERY BACKUP PHONE I HAVE EVER USED JUST HANGS 2 OR 3 TIMES EVERYDAY WHEN YOU WILL PLAY AN HD OR GOOD QUALITY GAMES WHICH YOU WON'T FACE A SINGLE IN ALSO A 6K FONE AND ITS DUAL PROCESSOR IS FAR BETTER THAN THE SONY LIVE WITH WALKMAN'S SINGLE CORE PROCESSOR SIMPLY WASTAGE OF MONEY TO BUY THIS PHONE FOR 20K"
Xperia P,1,"PHONE IS AWESOME NO DOUBT BUT IS CALL QUALITY SUCKS,USING THIS PHONE I AM ABLE TO HEAR EVERYONE PROPERLY BUT NEXT PERSON GETS VOICE IN A CRACKING MANNER,MAY BE SOME RANGE ISSUE,TOWERS ARE ALSO FULL,TRIED DIFFERENT SERVICE PROVIDERS LIKE AIRTEL,DOCOMO,VODAFONE,ISSUE IS SAME EVEN WITH HANDSFREE AND ON SKYPE ,YAHOO ETC,
      
      I DONOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PHONE AS I IGNORED REVIEWS AND WASTED MONEY ,PLEASE YOU DONT DO SO...
      
      THANKS."
Xperia P,1,"PLEASE NOTE THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE TYPICALLY FOR *SOME* AIRTEL AND VODAFONE USERS. I AM ON AIRTEL, BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON DIWALI (14TH NOV'12) AND GUESS WHAT.. I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO USE IT EVEN FOR A WEEK.
      
      
      I GOT ONE REPLACEMENT JUST WITHIN FIRST 10 DAYS OF SUBMITTING THE PHONE TO THEIR SERVICE CENTRE, IT TOOK 10 MORE DAYS TO GET ANOTHER BRAND NEW PHONE AND VERY UNFORTUNATELY THAT PHONE ALSO HAD EXACTLY SAME PROBLEM.. HERE MY STRUGGLE STARTED.
      
      
      THE PROBLEM WAS SIMPLE, THE PHONE WOULD FORGET ITS BASIC PHONE FUNCTIONALITY JUST LIKE THAT, FOR EXAMPLE IF THE PHONE IS IN FRONT OF ME ON MY DESK FOR FEW HOURS WHERE ALL OTHER OPERATIONS ARE FINE AND IT WILL ALSO SHOW NETWORK BUT IF I PICK UP THE PHONE AND TRY TO CALL, THE PHONE WILL SIMPLY STAY IDLE WITHOUT CONNECTING TO THE DIALED NUMBER OR WONT GIVE ANY ERROR.. THEN, I TRY TO CALL THE MOBILE PHONE FROM MY DESK PHONE I AND THAT TOO AGAIN END UP WITHOUT ANY ERROR.. IF I TRY TO SEND A MSG, TURN ON BLUETOOTH, NOTHING HAPPENS AND BELIEVE ME, THIS HAS HAPPENED FOR TWO 'BRAND NEW' XPERIAP PHONES.
      
      
      I KINDLY REQUESTED THE SONY MANAGEMENT TO REFUND MY MONEY AS THE PHONE HAD A FAULT, I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE 'REFUND' POLICY AND THAT THE PHONE WORKS WITH OTHER SIM-CARDS SO IT?S BETTER THAT I CHANGE MY SIM CARD :), WHAT A JOKE!!
      
      
      SO I SHOULD CHANGE THE SIM CARD BECAUSE SONY PHONE HAS PROBLEM, GREAT..
      
      NOW THEY HAVE ISSUED SECOND DOA CERTIFICATE, THAT MEANS I SHALL NOW GET THIRD PHONE FROM THE RETAILER BUT I AM PRETTY SURE THAT SONY GUYS HAVEN?T FIXED THIS ISSUE OVER THESE 1 AND HALF MONTHS.. SO PRECISELY IF THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS, I SHALL HAVE TO GO TO CONSUMER COURT.
      
      
      UPDATE:
      
      THE RETAILER WAS KIND ENOUGH TO PAY MY MONEY BACK AFTER LISTENING TO ALL THIS STORY. THANKS TO HIM, BUT I SHALL NEVER BUY A SONY PHONE IN FUTURE.
      
      
      THINK TWICE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO THRU WHAT I SUFFERED FROM...
      
      
      NO OPTION BUT TO GIVE ONE STAR."

      I RECOMMEND THIS PHONE"
Xperia U,5,"AS SOON I GOT MY HANDS ON THIS PHONE I WAS AMAZED BY THE DISPLAY CLARITY AND THE LIGHT STRIP AT THE BOTTOM WHICH LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL.
      
      
      I WAS A BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE BATTERY SINCE IT HOUSES A 1320 MAH LI-ION BUT THE BATTERY PERFORMANCE PROVED ME WRONG. ON MEDIUM CONSUMPTION THE BATTERY CAN GO AT LEAST 1.5 DAYS, AND ON LIGHT USAGE IT CAN GO UPTO 2 DAYS WHICH IS PRETTY NEAT LOOKING AT THE PHONE'S FEATURES.
      
      
      THE PHOTOS TAKEN BY THE MAIN CAMERA ARE ABOVE AVERAGE QUALITY. ALTHOUGH THE CAMERA BUTTON IS A BIT RIGID BUT NOTHING MAJOR. I REALLY DON'T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT THE CAMERA IN A PHONE AS OTHER PEOPLE DO. JUST NOTE MP DOES NOT DIRECTLY TRANSLATE INTO QUALITY.
      
      ALSO THE TWO SECOND SLEEP-TO-SNAP FEATURE IS PRETTY SWEET.
      
      
      CALL QUALITY IS GOOD. THE CALLER IS ABLE TO HEAR MY VOICE VERY CLEARLY EVEN WHEN I AM IN A NOISY AREA. BUT THE VOLUME IS A BIT LOW WHICH CREATES A PROBLEM IF I AM IN A NOISY AREA. AS FOR THE EARPIECE, ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT CLARITY AT BOTH SIDES.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE INTO MUSIC THEN YOU GOING TO LOVE THIS PHONE. EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY WHEN LISTENING THROUGH THE EARPIECE AND EVEN THROUGH THE SPEAKERS.
      
      
      THE ONLY DRAWBACK WOULD BE THE NO MICRO SD SLOT. BUT IF YOU ARE LIKE ME WHO ONLY COPIES MP3 FILES TO YOUR PHONE THEN THE 4GB PROVIDED BY THIS PHONE IS ADEQUATE ENOUGH.
      
      
      THE PHONE CAME WITH GINGERBREAD, AND AS SOON I OPENED THE PACKAGE I INSTALLED ""PC COMPANION"" TO UPGRADE TO ICE CREAM SANDWICH. UNFORTUNATELY THAT TOOK 1.5 HRS TO DOWNLOAD BUT EVERYTHING WAS SMOOTH AFTER THAT.
      
      
      I HAVE COMPARED MANY PHONES BASED ON FEATURES BEFORE PURCHASING AND OVERALL I CAN SAY THIS IS THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY FOR A MID RANGE PHONE."

      PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE SIMPLE JEALOUS OF IT.
      
      I AGREE THIS PHONE DOESN'T HAVE A MEMORY SLOT. BUT 4GB IS ENOUGH , YOU TAKE A PIC UPLOAD ON FACEBOOK ETC THE MOST YOU WILL TRANSFER TO YOUR LAPTOP. HECK ! ITS A MOBILE NOT AN EXTERNAL HDD.
      
      
      I USE MY XPERIA U FOR CHAT LIKE WHATSAPP , VIBER , GTALK , SOMETIMES PLAY GAMES , INTERNET BROWSING , CALLING AND YES I DON'T LOAD MY CELLPHONE WHICH TONS OF APPS THAT HAVE ADS RUNNING AND MAKE YOUR CELLPHONE DAMN SLOW.
      
      
      LEARN WHAT TO INSTALL AND WHAT NOT TO.
      
      
      1) UNINSTALL ALL THE APPS THAT COMES PRE-INSTALLED
      
      2) SOMEONE WROTE YOU HAVE TO REFRESH FOR NEW MAILS IN EMAIL , WELL TURN ON THE AUTO-SYNC OPTION.
      
      3) USING VODAFONE 3G AND GETTING BLAZING SPEED FROM 6-8MBPS 10/10
      
      4) DAY LIGHT PIC ARE MIND BLOWING 10/10 , AT NIGHT OK 7/10
      
      5) USED SKYPE FOR VIDEO CALLING , DECENT FOR A VGA CAM 9/10
      
      6) G-MAPS WORKING ABSOLUTELY FINE 10/10
      
      7) TRIED GAMES LIKE ANGRY BIRD, TEMPLE RUN 2 , SPEED NIGHT , STICKCRICKET ALL WORKING WITHOUT ANY LAG 10/10

      THE FIRST THING THAT I DID AFTER GETTING THIS PRODUCT WAS UPGRADED IT TO ICS (ANDROID 4.0). IT WAS SMOOTH UPGRADE AND ITS WORKING PERFECT NOW. I GUESS EVERYBODY HERE HAS WRITTEN REVIEWS REGARDING PROS AND CONS OF THE PHONE SO I DONT HAVE TO SAY MUCH.
      
      
      I AM LITTLE SURPRISED HOW SONY COULD MANAGE EVERYTHING FROM PROCESSOR, CAMERAS(FROND AND BACK), BRAVIA DISPLAY AND TOUCHVIZ UI AT THIS PRICE TAG.

Xperia U,5,"GOT THIS PHONE 2 WEEKS BACK AND UPGRADED IT TO ICS.
      
      OKAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE ISSUES WITH ICS UPGRADE ON XPERIA U.FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
      
      
      1. UPGRADE TO ICS FROM PC COMPANION AND EXPECT LOTS OF LAG
      
      (IF IT DOESN'T LAG THEN BOY YOU'RE LUCKY SKIP THE NEXT STEPS) ;)
      
      2. BACK UP YOUR DATA USING PC COMPANION'S BACK UP
      
      3. SELECT REPAIR MODE AND COMPLETE THE REPAIR AND WAH LAH! ICS IS SMOOTH AND FASTER NOW

      FOR EVERYONE ELSE GO AND BUY A SAMSUNG SMARTPHONE AND START DRIVING A TATA INDICA OR AMBASSADOR"
Xperia U,5,"GUYS I BOUGHT THE PHONE 10 MONTHS BACK WHEN IT WAS JUST LAUNCHED IN INDIA IN MAY 2012. IT LACKS ONLY ON ONE ACCOUNT THAT IS MEMORY WHICH IS 8 GB (4 GB USER , 2 GB OS AND 2GB FOR APPS) OTHERWISE THERE IS NO SUCH PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      
      I PLAY HIGH END GAMES LIKE FRONTLINE COMMANDO , TOWERS AND TROLLS ETC.......
      
      SECONDLY THE CAMERA IS PRETTY AWESOME(I WOULD SAY THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS JUST AWESOME)
      
      MUSIC, I BET YOU CAN'T GET BETTER AUDIO OUTPUT IN YOUR EARBUDS THAN SONY NOT EVEN HTC'S FAMED BEATS IS AS GOOD.
      
      TOUCH EXPERIENCE IS FAR BETTER THAN ANY OTHER DEVICE YOU CAN GET WHETHER BE SAMSUNG , NOKIA OR HTC FOR THAT CASE. I HAVE AN IPAD ALSO SO COMPARING WITH THAT IF ANYTHING COMES CLOSER TO APPLE IN ALL DEPARTMENTS IT IS SONY
      
      THE BUILD QUALITY IS ALSO SUPERB.................PLUS THE CHANGING OF LIGHTS MAKES IT AN EYE CATCHER.
      
      
      FOR IGNORANT PEOPLE STUCK WITH MEMORY ISSUES PLEASE GET A LIFE................APPLE IPHONE 4 ALSO HAS 8GB OUT OF WHICH U ONLY GET 6.3 GB AND THAT TOO FOR 25K+ ."
Xperia U,5,"GUYS I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 3 MONTHS BACK IN 13100 BUCKS. I HEARD OF ONE LOW POINT THAT IS MEMORY WHICH IS 8 GB (4 GB USER , 2 GB OS AND 2GB FOR APPS) BEFORE BUYING IT BUT ON CONSIDERING THE USAGE OF MINE I FOUND 4 GB SUFFICIENT FOR ME.
      
      SO ITS INDIVIDUAL CHOICE ON STORAGE OF XPERIA U.I CONSIDERED STORAGE CAPACITY AS OPTION/CHOICE  NOT DISADVANTAGE ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1) DISPLAY IS CRISPY AND CLEAR DUE TO HIGH PPI (280 PPI).TEXT IS VERY CLEAR SO IF YOU FOUND SCREEN SMALLER FOR TEXT READING GIVE ONE CLICK ON ZOOM IN SCREEN TAB(+) AND ENJOY LARGE TEXT WITH CLEAR VIEW.
      
      2) 1 GHZ DUAL CORE CPU PROCESSOR + MALI 400 GPU WILL WORK AS BREAD AND BUTTER.YOU CAN NOT FIND THIS EXTREME COMBINATION IN MID RANGE MOBILE IN OTHER BRANDS.YOU CAN PLAY HD VIDEO AND  GAMES LIKE TEMPLE RUN 2 VERY SMOOTHLY.
      
      3) AWESOME ILLUMINATION BAR(THAT'S WHAT MAKE YOU STAND DIFFERENT IN CROWD)
      
      4) SOUND QUALITY - GOOD AT SPEAKER PHONE AND GREAT IN SONY EARPHONE.
      
      5) GOOD HAND GRIP AND AVOID THE CHANCES OF FALLING THE PHONE FROM HAND.TOTALLY SCRATCH FREE BODY.
      
      6)CAMERA IS EXCELLENT IN DAY LIGHT. HD VIDEO AT 720P IS FAR BETTER THEN ANY PHONE IN THIS RANGE OR EVEN 15000-20000 RANGE.
      
      7)HAVING 0.3 MP FRONT CAMERA,MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR SKYPE CHAT.(NOT IN HTC ONE V)
      
      
      FIRST THREE POINTS MOSTLY INFLUENCE ME TO BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN THIS BUDGET.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1)BATTERY BACKUP CAN BE IMPROVED BIT MORE(MAY BE 1600-2000 MAH). IN NORMAL USAGE,2 DAYS AT THE MOST AND AT HD GAMES OR WIFI OR 3G INTERNET LAST ONLY ONE DAY.
      
      2) 512 MB RAM ADVERTISED, ONLY 368 MB IS USER AVAILABLE.HERE WHAT LAG COMES EVEN HAVING DUAL CORE PROCESSOR. IT SHOULD BE 768 RAM AT LEAST FOR DUAL CORE."
Xperia U,5,"GUYS SAR FOR THIS PHONE IS MAX AT 1.6. HOWEVER CHECK OTHER WEBSITES SUCH AS PHONE ARENA(1.02) OR WIKIPEDIA (1.22), ITS RELATIVELY LESSER. ANY SAR TILL 2.0 IS NOT HARMFUL HOWEVER US GOVT ALLOWS SOME 1.7 SAR AT MAX. EVEN THE SAR FOR IPHONE 4S IS ALMOST 1.2.

Xperia U,5,"HELLO EVERYONE,
      
      I BOUGHT THIS BEAUTY 29TH MAY 2013. SO THIS IS MY REVIEW AFTER USING IT FOR ALMOST A WEEK.
      
      HATS OFF TO FLIPKART FOR THE INCREDIBLY FAST DELIVERY. I ORDERED ON 28TH MAY AND GOT IT THE NEXT DAY.
      
      I HAVE ALSO UPDATED MY ANDROID VERSION TO ICS.SO LET ME START WITH THE REVIEW.
      
      PROS:
      
      THIS PHONE LOOKS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. YOU CAN EASILY HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND UNLIKE OTHER BIG SCREEN MOBILES.
      
      THE CALL QUALITY IS INCREDIBLY CRISP.
      
      THE MUSIC IS REFRESHING.
      
      THE PHOTOS AND VIDEOS ARE AMAZINGLY CRISP.
      
      BROWSING IN THIS PHONE FEELS AWESOME.
      
      GAMES RUN SMOOTHLY.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      THE SCREEN IS JUST 3.5 INCHES.
      
      THE MEMORY AVAILABLE TO THE USER EXCLUDING APPS IS JUST 4 GB.
      
      THE USB OTG FEATURE IN THIS PHONE DOES DETECT THE FLASH DRIVES, BUT ITS
      
      NOT ABLE TO MOUNT IT BECAUSE THE DEVICE CONSUMES TOO MUCH POWER.
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT:
      
      I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE, IF THEY CAN OVERLOOK THE SCREEN SIZE AND MEMORY PROBLEM.
      
      THIS PHONE IS DEFINITELY ""VALUE FOR MONEY""."
Xperia U,5,"HELLO THERE TO EVERYONE,
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE SINCE 6 MONTHS.BELIEVE FROM THE MOMENT YOU SWITCH ON THIS DEVICE YOU WILL LOVE IT.
      
      
      IT HAS GOT A GREAT INFACT SUPERB DISPLAY QUALITY.AWESOME FOR 3.5 INCH.
      
      WILL REALLY GIVE YOU A GREAT SATISFACTION ABOUT COLOURS WHILE WATCHING ANY VIDEO ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      BATTERY BACK UP IS GOOD. SINCE BATTERY DRAIN DOWN FROM 80 TO 20% IN JUST 3 HRS WHEN YOU WATCH VDOS ON WEBSITES OR YOUTUBE.
      
      
      ABOUT THE CAMERA, IT CLICKS GREAT PICTURES AND VIDEOS AT DAY TIME.BUT WILL DISAPPOINT YOU AT NIGHT SCENES.
      
      
      LOUDSPEAKER IS NOT LOUD :D BUT HEADPHONE SOUNDS  SIMPLY AWESOME.
      
      
      WITH DUAL CORE AND MALI 400, ITS QUITE CAPABLE OF PLAYING ALMOST ALL HIGH GRAPHIC GAMES (EXCEPT NOVA )
      
      
      NOW AN OVERALL REVIEW IS THAT...
      
      
      ITS A BUDGET PHONE COZ IT COMES UNDER 15K, ITS STYLISH WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE *ILLUMINATING BARS* ITS FAST AND ITS SONY."

Xperia U,5,"HI GUYS , I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM UNIVERSAL AS FLIPKART DELIVERY IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THIS MODEL AT MY LOCATION..I WILL JUST TELL ABT WHAT ALL FEATURES I LIKE AND I DONT LIKE IN THIS PHONE..FIRST OF DISPLAY , ITS OUT OF THIS WORLD .. ITS MINDBLOWING .. I THINK THE PPI IS MORE THAN ENOUGH AS I FOUND SAMSUNG GRAND IS ONLY 183 IN PPI AS COMPARED TO THIS WITH PPI 270 +...ANY THING ABOVE 250 IS GOOD FOR THE SCREEN OF THIS RANGE...
      
      NEXT THING I LIKE THE MOST IS AUDIO CLARITY, SONY IS UNBEATABLE IN THAT CASE...
      
      MEMORY WONT BE A BIG ISSUE AS 4 GB IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR A AVERAGE USER..
      
      
      NOW THE ONLY THING ANNOYED ME IN THIS PHONE IS WHILE TYPING ( SMALL VIRTUAL KEYBOARD )..I GUESS IT WONT BE A BIG PROB WHEN I GET USED TO IT..."
Xperia U,5,"HI, I HAVE USED SO MANY MOBILE UPTO NOW. I HAVE USED NOKIA, SAMSUNG AND ALL OTHERS PRODUCTS. BUT I NEVER SEEN THIS MANY FEATURES AND THIS MUCH FASTER PROCESS IN THOSE MOBILES. THIS MOBILE IS NOW RUNNING UNDER ANDROID 2.3.7 WHICH CAN BE UPGRADABLE TO ANDROID 4( ICE CREAM SANDWICH). AND THERE IS SOME DISCUSSION ARE GOING TO UPGRADE THE MOBILE DIRECTLY TO ANDROID 4.1( JELLY BEAN). NOW ITSELF PROCESS IS GOOD. IF ANDROID UPDATED TO 4.0 OR 4.1 THEN NO NEED TO SAY. THIS WILL BE THE BEST MOBILE.
      
      
      AND SOME OF US CAN THINK THAT THIS MOBILE IS NOT HAVING THE MICRO USB SLOT. NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU STILL HAVE 4 GB OF INTERNAL MEMORY YOU STILL CAN  HAVE MORE THAN 5000 SONGS WHICH IS IN 320 KBPS QUALITY. AND NEARLY 4 MOVIES YOU CAN HAVE IN THIS MOBILE. AND ONE MORE THING IS THIS MOBILE SUPPORTS TO USB WITH OTG. YOU CAN USE YOUR PEN DRIVE IN THIS MOBILE. IF INTERNAL MEMORY IS INSUFFICIENT FOR YOU. THEN CARRY YOUR PENDRIVE ALONG WITH YOU. YOU JUST NEED A PENDRIVE AND A OTG CABLE. YOU CAN BUY AN OTG CABLE FROM EBAY. IT CASTS AROUND 200 BUCKS ONLY.
      
      
      AND REGARDING THE SOUND QUALITY AS USUAL NO ONE CAN DEFEAT SONY'S SOUND QUALITY. BUT THIS TIME THEY HAVE CHANGED THE EARPHONE STYLE AS NORMAL (WITHOUT EAR BUD).
      
      
      CAMERA QUALITY IS SIMPLY AWESOME, SUCH A NICE CLARITY.
      
      
      ADDITIONALLY SONY PROVIDES COUPLE OF BOTTOM COVERS IN DIFFERENT COLOURS, SO YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MOBILES BOTTOM COLOUR ACCORDING TO THE DRESS CODE, OR TO YOUR MOOD.
      
      
      AND ONE MORE BEST FEATURE IN THIS MOBILE TRANSPARENT LAYER JUST ABOVE THE BOTTOM COVER. THE COLOUR OF THE TRANSPARENT LAYER WILL BE CHANGED ACCORDING TO THE THEME YOU ARE CHOOSING, AND IF YOU ARE PLAYING A MUSIC, IT WILL CHANGE THE COLOUR TO THE TRACK ICON COLOUR, AND ALSO IF YOU ARE SEEING YOUR GALLERY, IT WILL CHANGE ITS COLOUR TO THE MAJOR COLOUR OF THE IMAGE THAT YOU ARE SEEING NOW.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR THE MOBILE IN THIS PRICE RANGE I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO GO FOR THIS MOBILE.
      
      
      IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY BY CHOOSING THE HIGHER PRICE MOBILE THEN I WOULD SAY THAT WOULD BE A BAD LUCK FOR YOU. WE JUST NEED A DEVICE TO CALL OTHERS SEEING MAILS AND DOING SOME SMALL SMALL STUFFS. WE DON'T NEED A SUPER COMPUTER TO CARRY WITH US.
      
      
      IF THIS REVIEW HURTS ANYONE PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES."
Xperia U,5,"I AM USING SONY XPERIA U FROM OCT 2012. IT IS AMAZING........
      
      I HAVE UPDATED MY DEVICE TO ICS AFTER LOT OF CONFUSION. BUT IT IS WORKING WELL.
      
      MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF THIS PHONE IS FLUID DISPLAY, CAMERA CLARITY, MODERATE BATTERY BACKUP, PROCESSOR SPEED ETC....
      
      ANYHOW MY CHOICE IS WORKING VERY WELL FOR ME. IF YOU ASK ABOUT THE INTERNAL MEMORY, THAT IS 4GB ONLY. THOUGH THE LOW STORAGE, I COUDNT EXCEED EVEN 2GB STORAGE TILL NOW.
      
      FRIENDS U BELIEVE IT OR NOT I BOUGHT THIS XPERIA U AFTER SELLING OF MY NOKIA LUMIA 610(JUST 25 DAYS OLD)
      
      MY SUGGESTION TO U ALL WHEN U WANT FANTASTIC FEATURES WITH OPTIMAL BATTERY BACKUP AND MEMORY USAGE U CAN SURELY CHOOSE THIS PHONE.
      
      STILL I DIDN'T BORED WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      BEFORE BUYING ANY PHONE WITH BUDGET BETWEEN 10K - 18K PLS COMPARE UR CHOICE WITH THIS PHONE FEATURES. I CAN SURE IT WILL SCORES OVER UR CHOICE
      
      ANY PHONE THERE WILL BE A CONCERN. IT IS APPLICABLE FOR XPERIA U ALSO
      
      THE CONCERN IS UPDATE OF JELLY BEAN, STILL QUESTION MARK....
      
      AT THE END.... I AM SPREADING MY SATISFACTION TO U (WHOM READS THIS REVIEW)"
Xperia U,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM PAST 8 MONTHS AND AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PHONE. THOSE FOOLS WHO ARE QUESTIONING THE SPEED OF THE PHONE ARE USELESS BUNCH OF FELLOWS. THE PHONE IS BRILLIANTLY SHAPED AS IT FITS AMAZINGLY WELL IN YOUR HANDS. THE DISPLAY QUALITY IS GREAT AND THE TOUCH IS ALSO VERY GOOD.
      
      
      CAMERA QUALITY CANT BE QUESTIONED WITH SONY (THOUGH APPLE IS PROMOTING THE PANORAMA VIEW WHICH IS ALREADY THERE IN THIS PHONE AND 3D PANORAMA TOO)
      
      
      PLASTIC QUALITY IS FAR FAR BETTER THAN THE (SELF PROCLAIMED ANDROID KING) SAMSUNG WHICH IS USING 3RD CLASS PLASTIC IN EVEN THE S-SERIES. THE BEST PART OF THE PLASTIC IS ITS SCRATCH RESISTANCE. (AFTER EIGHT MONTHS MY PHONE DOESN'T HAVE ANY SCRATCH) . IT LOOKS FAR CLASSY AND ELEGANT THAN MANY PHONES ABOVE ITS CATEGORY.
      
      
      I HAVE NOT SEEN THE SONY SERVICE CENTER BECAUSE I DIDN'T REQUIRE IT YET(FINGERS CROSSED). I DON'T BOTHER OF LESS SERVICE CENTER IF THE PHONES ARE OF GUD QUALITY RATHER THAN HAVING SERVICE CENTER IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS CITY (SAMSUNG REQUIRES IT AS ITS THEIR NEED DUE TO THE LOW QUALITY PHONE).
      
      
      WILL UPGRADE THE PHONE WITH THE NEXT XPERIA ONLY!!!"
Xperia U,5,"I AM USING THIS PHONE SINCE 2 MONTHS. I UPDATED IT TO ICS AT FIRST IT WAS LAGGING A LOT BUT WHEN I DID A TOTAL FACTORY RESET (WHICH DELETES ALL DATA) IT STARTED WORKING VERY SMOOTHLY.
      
      NOTE: BEFORE YOU PERFORM FACTORY RESET YOU NEED TO TAKE BACKUP OF YOU PHONE DATA USING SONY COMPANION SOFTWARE.
      
      MY PHONE WAS FALLEN ON ROAD WHEN I WAS ON BIKE WHICH WAS RUNNING WITH SPEED OF MORE THAN 50 KMPH BUT NOT MORE DAMAGE WAS HAPPENED EXCEPT THE SCREEN-GUARD. SCREEN-GUARD WAS FULLY BRUISED BUT IT DID NOT LET SCREEN GET A SINGLE SCRATCH. HATS OFF FOR SONY'S SCREEN-GUARD.
      
      BEFORE FACTORY RESET IT WAS HAVING WI-FI DROP PROBLEM BUT NOW IT HAS SOLVED.ONE MAY HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS AFTER ICS UPDATE BUT THOSE WILL GET SOLVED AFTER FACTORY RESET.
      
      
      FEATURES:-
      
      1) FAST CAPTURE CAMERA (HOLD CAMERA KEY FOR 4-5 SECONDS DESPITE PHONE BEING LOCKED ).
      
      2) 720P VIDEO RECORDING.
      
      3) MULTI FOCUS CAMERA (NEW BUYERS MAY HAVE FOUND A BIT DELAY IN PICTURE CLICKS NO WORRY          CHANGE FOCUS MODE TO MULTI OR INFINITY IT WILL CLICK PICTURES INSTANTLY)
      
      4)BRILLIANT ULTRA BRIGHT SCREEN WHICH MAKES HD VIDEOS (1080P) TO LOOK VERY CLEAR. (MX PLAYER IS THE BEST APP WHICH PLAYS ALL TYPES OF VIDEOS)
      
      5) DUAL CORE PROCESSOR REALLY WORKS BRILLIANTLY AND PLAYS GAMES VERY SMOOTHLY
      
      6)BATTERY PERFORMANCE WILL BE IMPROVED IF WE INSTALL JUICE DEFENDER APP.
      
      7) SMART CONNECT APP FROM SONY IS VERY HELPFUL AND CAN ALSO READ MESSAGES.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      SONY HAS NOT OPTIMIZED ICS VERSION FOR XPERIA PHONES WE NEED TO STOP SOME APPS IF RAM GOES MORE THAN 400 MB."
Xperia U,5,I BOUGHT THIS FROM A LOCAL STORE...THIS PHONE IS A MONSTER IN ITS PRICE RANGE...I CAN PLAY ALL HUGE GAMES....DUAL CORE....ONLY SMALL PROB IS ITS SCREEN SIZE FOR ME CAUSE I NEED IT TO READ MAILS AND STUFF....REST SCREEN CLARITY IS MINDBLOWING....DEFINITLY YES DONT WAIT...
Xperia U,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 1 WEEK BACK. I LOVE IT.SPECIALLY CAMERA QUALITY,DISPLAY AND SOUND ARE AWESOME.LOOK ALSO GOOD. I DON'T MIND WITH NO CARD SLOT.I AM SATISFY WITH MEMORY.I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO BUY THIS PHONE.ITS AWESOME."
Xperia U,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER DOING ALMOST A MONTH OF RESEARCH FOR MOBILES IN THE RANGE OF 13K-15K AND CAME UP WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT, THE SXU IS THE BEST.
      
      THIS MOBILE IS FOR:
      
      - GAMERS
      
      - STYLE SEEKERS
      
      - EVERYDAY USERS
      
      - GPS USERS
      
      - SOCIAL APPERS
      
      
      IT IS NOT FOR:
      
      - PEOPLE WHO RELY SOLELY ON THEIR PHONES FOR MULTIMEDIA BECAUSE OF LIMITED STORAGE (NOTE: USB ON THE GO IS SUPPORTED)
      
      
      I AM A FIRST-TIME USER OF A SMARTPHONE AND I MUST SAY THAT THIS PHONE IS MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.
      
      
      WHY?
      
      
      - SCREEN : IT HAS AN AWESOME SCREEN - &GT;280PPI PIXEL DENSITY WITH A 16:9 ASPECT RATIO WITH BRAVIA ENGINE. THE SCREEN IS RICH AND VERY SHARP AND HAS A SORT OF SOFTNESS TO IT(COS YOU CANT SEE THE EDGES OF EACH PIXEL). THE PPI IS I THINK, BETTER THAN SXP.
      
      - ILLUMINATION BAR : THOUGH COMPLETELY USELESS IN TERMS OF DAILY USE, IT GIVES THIS PHONE A SOUL OF ITS OWN (AS GSMARENA PUTS IT, ""THE ULTIMATE SHOW OFF FEATURE""). THE LED LIGHTING CHANGES WITH YOUR THEME OR PHOTO AND AN APP CALLED 'ILLUMINATION BAR NOTIFICATION' CAN MAKE IT FUNCTION AS A VISUAL NOTIFIER. VERY COOL.
      
      - STYLE: IMO, I'VE NEVER SEEN A BETTER LOOKING PHONE THAN THIS. ITS SHARP EDGED DESIGN APPEALS TO ME MORE THAN THE CURVY PROFILE OF IPHONE OR SAMSUNG.
      
      - DUAL CORE PROCESSOR: A 1 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AT THIS PRICE IS RARELY SEEN. THIS PHONE HAS HIGH SCORES IN THE BENCHMARKS BY SITES LIKE GSM ARENA AND OUTSHINES ALL ITS COMPETITORS IN TERMS OF PROCESSING POWER. THIS RESULTED IN LAG-FREE(MOSTLY) BROWSING AND WONDERFUL GAMING.
      
      - ANDROID 4.0 ICS UPDATE : SONY PROVIDES AN UPGRADE FOR ICS AND I AM HAPPY TO SEE THAT THIS UPGRADE BRINGS A LOT OF FEATURES WITH IT. UPGRADING IT ACTUALLY SPEEDS UP THE PHONE AND OPTIMISES RAM USAGE.
      
      - REMOVABLE BATTERY: BEING A TREKKER AND SO A HEAVY GPS USER, I FOUND IT EXTREMELY HELPFUL THAT YOU CAN REPLACE THE BATTERY. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE SXP.
      
      - THE MEMORY SPACE: I ALREADY HAVE A SONY MP4 PLAYER AND DID NOT REALLY NEED A LARGE MEMORY SO THIS WASNT AN ISSUE FOR ME AS IT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR A QUITE A FEW SONGS AND SOME VIDEOS.
      
      
      BTW, THIS PHONE IS ONE OF THE TOP 10 PHONES IN GSMARENA (AS ON 9/11/2012)
      
      
      DO NOT BUY THIS IF:
      
      - YOUR BUDGET CAN GO UP TO 22K AS SOME BETTER PHONES ARE AVAILABLE.
      
      - YOU NEED A BIGGER SCREEN. THIS SCREEN IS THE SMALLEST OF THE NXT SERIES OF THE XPERIAS.
      
      - YOU USE IT A LOT AS A MULTIMEDIA PLAYER
      
      - YOU NEED AN EXCELLENT CAMERA. THIS PHONE'S IS PRETTY BASIC AND NOT TOO GREAT WITH LOW LIGHT.
      
      
      SMALL COMPLAINT I HAD: THE NOTIFICATION LIGHT IS TOO DIM (BUT THE APP MENTIONED ABOVE MORE THAN COMPENSATES)
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, A GREAT BUDGET TO MID-RANGE PHONE WHICH WILL NOT BE OUTDATED ANYTIME SOON.
      
      
      REVIEWS:
      
      CHECK OUT GSMARENA AND THEVERGE FOR IN-DEPTH REVIEWS."
Xperia U,5,I CURRENTLY BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND THERE ARE NO ISSUES IT SUPPORTS ALL VIDEO FORMATS INCLUDING MKV AND TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS GREAT AND PROCESSOR IS AWESOME AND IT SURELY BEATS ALL MID RANGE COMPETITORS AND FOR MEMORY SONY PROVIDES CLOUD STORAGE OF 50 GB AND XPERIA U SUPPORTS OTG WHICH ADDS MORE POWER TO THIS PHONE AND IT WILL ALSO RECEIVE JELLYBEAN SO XPERIA U IS UNBEATABLE AT A PRICE TAG OF RS 14990. NOW I AM A HUGE FAN OF SONY .
Xperia U,5,"I GAVE THIS BEUTIFUL MOBILE TO MY FIANCEE AS A GIFT.. THIS IS A FANTASTIC PHONE...DIS PHONE HAS AWESOME KILLING LOOKS...SOME OF U HAVE SM DOUBTS ABT VIDEO CALLING...YES..THIS PHONE DOESN'T HAVE AN OPTION OF VIDEO CALLING..BUT IT DOES HAVE OPTION OF VIDEO CHAT...I MEAN, U CAN VIDEO CHAT ON SKYPE, GTALK AND FACBOOK...I HAVE TRIED ALL OF THEM...ITS WORKING PERFECTLY...
      
      CONS ACC TO MY FIANCEE:
      
      1. POOR BATTERY,
      
      2. SOUND IS NOT TOO LOUD
      
      ....
      
      I WONT WRITE PROS AS MOST OF GUYS HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN ABT THIS...OVERALL DIS PHONE IS BEST IN THIS PRICE RANGE...A MUST BUY PHONE..GO FR THIS...ENJOY"
Xperia U,5,"I GOT THIS FEW MONTHS BACK..AND I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE./THE SONY BRAVIA TECHNOLOGY AND THE CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD...
      
      AS EXPECTED ,SOUND QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD.
      
      SUPERFAST PROCESSOR .
      
      8GB MEMORY AND 47GB USABLE ..
      
      REALLY GOOD PHONE FOR THIS PRICE ....
      
      GO FOR IT GUYS......................."
Xperia U,5,"I HAVE A SMALL IT COMPANY. AND I CAN DO EVERYTHING IN MY BUSINESS LIFE WITH THIS PHONE. ITS BEST EVER, AND COST IN FLIPKART IS LOWER THEN MARKET. IT WAS MY SECOND ANDROID PHONE, BUT IS BEST THEN ALL PHONES I USED IN MY LIFE"
Xperia U,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR 2 WEEKS NOW AND I CAN SAFELY SAY THAT IT IS MORE THAN VALUE FOR MONEY.
      
      
      THE DESIGN IS SUPERB, IDEAL FOR ONE HAND USE, SCREEN IS SHARP AND RESPONSIVE, GOOD EARPHONES WITH BASS ENHANCEMENT, 720P (HD) VIDEOS PLAY SEAMLESSLY AND ALL THE 3D GAMES WORKS WITHOUT A GLITCH.
      
      
      THE PROBLEM WITH LIMITED MEMORY IS NOT REALLY A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU GET A 4 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AND AN ADDITIONAL 2 GB PHONE MEMORY FOR APPLICATIONS WITH AN OPTION TO CONNECT TO EXTERNAL USB STORAGE DEVICES.
      
      
      512 MB RAM IS JUST ABOUT ENOUGH TO GET THE JOB DONE. YOU CAN INSTALL AN 'APP KILLER' FROM GOOGLE PLAY TO FREE UP ADDITIONAL MEMORY IF YOU ARE A HEAVY USER.
      
      
      DO NOT HESITATE TO UPGRADE TO OFFICIAL ICS VERSION AS SOON AS YOU GET THE PHONE BECAUSE WITHOUT IT YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE FONT SIZE WHICH IS SMALL AND FRUSTRATING IN GB VERSION.
      
      
      IF YOU WANT A SCREEN LARGER THAN 3.5 INCH OR AN EXPANDABLE MEMORY OR A ROUGH USE PHONE IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE LOOK FOR XPERIA GO MODEL. IF YOU WANT A HIGHER PRICE RANGE PHONE GO FOR XPERIA P, NOKIA 800 OR SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE."
Xperia U,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE A FEW DAYS AGO AND WAS VERY MUCH SATISFIED BY ITS PERFORMANCE.
      
      THE ONLY PRBLM THAT DISAPPOINTED ME WAS THE USE OF FLASH LIGHT IN CAMERA WHICH RESULTED IN FOGGY PICTURES.
      
      
      THE SOLUTION WAS VERY SIMPLE AND SILLY, JUST REMOVED THE PROTECTIVE TRANSPARENT COVER OVER THE FLASH :D.
      
      
      HOORAY AND THE PHONE IS COMPLETELY FINE NOW :)."
Xperia U,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN JUNE 2012 AND I AM VERY HAPPY WIH THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PHONE. AFTER UPGRADING TO ICS THIS PHONE BECOMES LITTLE SLOW, BUT SUPERCHARGED THIS PHONE WITH V6 SPERCHARGER SCRIPT FOR ROOTED PHONES.THIS MAKE MY PHONE A MONSTER AND NOW IT CAN RUN NFS MOST WANTED TYPE GAMES VERY EASILY.IT HAS RESPONSE LIKE GALAXY S3 WITHOUT ANY LAG. IN THIS PRICE RANGE THIS IS ONLY PHONE WITH MALI 400 GPU, BEST GPU TILL DECEMBER 2012, ALSO USED IN S3. SO GO ON WITH THIS PHONE IF YOU REALLY WANT PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      PROS: SMALLER SCREEN, LESS MEMORY THESE 2 ISSUE WILL ALWAYS MAKE U SAD WITH THIS PHONE."
Xperia U,5,I HAVE BOUGHT XPERIA U PHONE ON APRIL 2013..... STILL NOW I HAVE NOT FACED ANY PROBLEMS  IN MY PHONE... MEMORY IS NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL! U WILL HAVE MORE THAN 2GB AFTER INSTALLING APPS..... TO EXTEND THE MEMORY OTG CABLE CAN BE USED TO CONNECT A PENDRIVE TO UR PHONE... HD RECORDING IN THIS PHONE S AWESOME... COMPARING WITH XPERIA MIRO THIS PHONE HAS MORE ADVANTAGES EXCEPT THAT XPERIA U CANT SUPPORT MEMORY CARDS... BUT THAT'S NOT AT ALL A ISSUE! JUST GO FOR IT! IT S AWESOME :)
Xperia U,5,"I HAVE USED THIS PHONE FOR A MONTH NOW, AND TILL NOW I DID NOT FACE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE PHONE. THE PHONE IS USER FRIENDLY, I AM USING ANDROID OS FOR THE 1ST TIME AND DINT FACE ANY ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND FEATURES PROVIDED IN THE PHONE. THE DRAWBACKS MAJORLY ARE OF NO UP GRADABLE MEMORY ( WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT REQUIRED FOR ME) AND BATTERY DRAINS FAST (EXPECTED WHEN INTERNET IS USED AND GAMES ARE PLAYED) WHICH ARE LIKE TRIVIAL ONES FOR THIS PHONE AS IT IS GIVING U MORE THAN WHAT U WOULD BE EXPECTING FOR A PHONE OF THIS COST."
Xperia U,5,"I HAVE USED THIS PHONE FOR THE OVER 1 MONTH NOW, SO HAVE USED ALL THE GENERAL FEATURES.
      
      
      BATTERY:
      
      LASTS AROUND 3 - 4 HOURS IF YOU ARE CONTINUOUSLY PLAYING A RESOURCE INTENSIVE GAME ( LIKE TEMPLE RUN / 3D CRICKET ). LASTS AROUND 6 TO 8 HOURS IF YOU ARE ROAMING AND CONTINUOUSLY BROWSING INTERNET ( FOR EXAMPLE ON A TRAIN JOURNEY EVERY WEEKEND) . LASTS MORE THAN A DAY IF YOU ARE OCCASIONAL AT READING NEWS, CHECKING FACEBOOK, LISTENING SONGS FOR 1 HOUR AND MAKING PHONE CALLS OF 1 HOURS EACH OFFICE DAY. BATTERY HASN'T BEEN A PROBLEM FOR ME AS I KEEP MY PHONE CHARGED AT OFFICE WHILE ON MY LAPTOP. IF YOU ARE A INDOOR PERSON LIKE ME YOU WILL HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THE BATTERY BACK UP.
      
      
      GRAPHICS QUALITY:
      
      CRYSTAL CLEAR. NO PROBLEMS WHILE PLAYING HD GAMES / MOVIES. NO LAGS AT ALL. THE DUAL CORE PROCESSOR IS A POWER HOUSE. THERE IS A SONY BRAVIA ENGINE IN THE PHONE WHICH DOES ALL THIS.
      
      
      STORAGE:
      
      INTERNAL 4 GB + USER 4 GB. ALSO THERE IS 50 GB FREE CLOUD SPACE. USER 4 GB MAY SEEM LESS, HOWEVER IF YOU ARE AN ORGANISED PERSON 4 GB IS MORE THAN ENOUGH. I HAVE INSTALLED 100 SONGS AND HAVE 20 ANDROID APPS (OF AVERAGE SIZE 5 MB ). STILL HAVE MORE THAN 2 GB LEFT TO USE. OF COURSE IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO STORE PORN IN YOUR MOBILE NOTHING IS ENOUGH !
      
      
      SOUND:
      
      SOUND QUALITY WHILE LISTENING TO SONGS IS VERY SOOTHING. SONY SOUND SYSTEMS ARE A CLASS OF ITS OWN.
      
      IF YOU HAVE THE NOISE CORRECTION FEATURE ON, THEN EARPIECE SOUND IS LOW WHEN YOU ARE OUTDOORS. IF YOU TURN OFF THE NOISE CORRECTION FEATURE, EARPIECE SOUND BECOMES JUST FINE. LOUD SPEAKER IS NOT THAT LOUD. HOWEVER, YOU CAN USE SOUND BOOSTER APPS FROM THE ANDROID MARKET TO BOOST IT. SO, PROBLEM SOLVED AGAIN. :-)
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      DAYLIGHT SNAPS HAVE GOOD CLARITY FOR A 5 MEGAPIXELS RESOLUTION. LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM WITH ANY MOBILE CAMERA, SO CAN'T BLAME IT. THERE IS A LED FLASH. A FRONT VGA CAMERA FOR VIDEO CALLS AS WELL. QUITE HANDY ! THERE ARE ANDROID APPS WHICH CAN MAKE THE LED CAMERA FLASH TO BEHAVE AS A TORCH AS WELL. VERY SMART !
      
      
      LED LIGHT BAND:
      
      THE IS A STYLISH LED BAND AT THE BOTTOM WHICH KEEPS CHANGING ITS COLOUR AS PER THE IMMEDIATE THEME ON THE CURRENT SCREEN. MANY ARE AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL REASON FOR DRAINING OUT BATTERY, HOWEVER IT TOO CAN BE TURNED OFF BY USING AN ANDROID APP ( SCREEN FILTER). NO PROBLEMS AGAIN !
      
      
      TOUCH SENSITIVITY:
      
      NO PROBLEMS WITH TOUCH, EVEN AFTER I HAVE PUT ON A SCREEN GUARD. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
      
      
      ANDROID VERSION:
      
      THE GINGERBREAD VERSION IS UPGRADEABLE TO ICECREAMSANDWITCH IF YOU WISH TO. HOWEVER THERE IS A CAUTION FROM OTHER USERS: THAT THE SYSTEM GETS SLOW, AND IT IS NOT REVERSIBLE ( DOWNGRADE-ABLE ). SO, I HAVE NO PLANS OF TRYING IT.
      
      
      OVERALL:
      
      AN EXCELLENT BUY AT THIS PRICE. LOWER MODELS OF XPERIA STILL HAVE SOME PROBLEMS, IF YOU GO THROUGH THE CUSTOMER FEEDBACKS. HOWEVER XPERIA U IS A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH. A VERY INTELLIGENT COMBINATION OF ALL GENERAL FEATURES AND THAT TOO MAINTAINING THE QUALITY AT A PRICE CLOSE TO 10K.
      
      
      LOOKING AT THE PRICE + FEATURES PROVIDED + WORKAROUND POSSIBLE FOR THE SHORT COMINGS + QUALITY OF FEATURES, I GIVE IT A 5 ON 5.
      
      
      VERY SATISFIED. JUST GO FOR IT."
Xperia U,5,I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND TO BUY XPERIA U...ITS LIKE SUPERB. WHEN YOU COMPARE WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS YOU CAN'T STOP BUYING XPERIA. THE ONLY ADVANTAGE OF  S-DUOS IS ITS SIZE. XPERIA IS FABULOUS.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Xperia U,5,"I THNK DIS IS D BEST PHONE IN D RANGE IT IS SOLD...
      
      GOOD CAMERA,DUAL CORE PROCESSOR.NICE LOOK,GRT PERFORMANCE...FOR YOUR KNOWLEDGE DIS PHONE IS DLNA CERTIFIED TOO....
      
      IF U ARE OKAY WID A BIT SMALLER SCREEN,LITTLE LOW SOUND  DAN DIS IS D PHONE U R LOOKING FOR.
      
      AND DONT WORRY FOR MEMORY ISSUES U CAN CONNECT UR PENDRIVE THROUGH OTG CABLE TO D PHONE(I VE CONNECTED TILL 16 GB)
      
      NOTE TRANSCEND PEN DRIVE WONT CONNECT"
Xperia U,5,"I WAS USING A SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS, WHICH I LOST. THEN I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART A WEEK AGO.
      
      
      I DO NOT NEED MUCH STORAGE ( I CARRY MY SONGS IN AN IPOD NANO). I JUST NEED A PHONE THAT I CAN USE TO CHECK FB, GMAIL AND MY OFFICE MAIL, TO READ OFFICE DOCUMENTS, SURF NET AND OCCASIONAL LIGHT GAMING (THINK ANGRY BIRDS :))
      
      
      THIS PHONE DOES ALL THESE BEAUTIFULLY. PERIOD.
      
      
      IF YOU DO NOT NEED MUCH STORAGE, AND DON'T NEED 5'' SCREEN, THIS IS A RECOMMENDED PRODUCT. IT DOES EVERYTHING IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO BEAUTIFULLY. ICS IS GREAT ON THIS PHONE.
      
      
      NOTE: AFTER ICS, IF YOU DO NOT RE CALIBRATE THE BATTERY, BATTERY LIFE IS HORRIBLE. AFTER CALIBRATION, IT IS FINE (1.5 DAYS MEDIUM USE). PLEASE GOOGLE HOW TO DO CALIBRATION AFTER ICS."
Xperia U,5,"IF YOUR BUDGET IS 15K, THEN YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS PHONE.FULL MARKS TO FLIPKART FOR THEIR EXCELLENT SERVICE.A VERY ATTRACTIVE PHONE.ONE CAN EASILY GET ADDICTED TO IT.
      
      ALL THE PROS AND CONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN OTHER REVIEWS. OVERALL A VERY GOOD PRODUCT."
Xperia U,5,"IT IS BEST PHONE....
      
      XPERIA NXT SERIES PRESENTS THE XPERIA U SMARTPHONE THAT IS DESIGNED TO DEMAND ATTENTION. THE TOUCHSCREEN PHONE RUNS ON A POWERFUL 1 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND IS BASED ON THE ANDROID V2.3 (GINGERBREAD) OPERATING SYSTEM WITH TIMESCAPE USER INTERFACE. THE USER-FRIENDLY OS PROMISES A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, EASY MULTITASKING AND OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE. THE XPERIA U HAS A 3.5-INCH TFT CAPACITIVE TOUCHSCREEN THAT SUPPORTS FWVGA, 854 X 480 PIXEL RESOLUTION WITH 16 M COLOURS OFFERING YOU EASY NAVIGATION AND COLOURFUL DISPLAY.
      
      I SAY IT IS THE ONE PHONE THAT OFFERS SUCH FEATURES IN THIS MINIMUM PRICE RANGE......  REGARDS.   !!! :-)"
Xperia U,5,"ITS A VERY AWESOME PHONE WITH FANTASTIC FUNCTION IN A REASONABLE PRICE. GOOD QUALITY OF  PICTURE , CAMERA AND ALL THE FUNCTION WHICH YOU NORMALLY USE. ONLY THE DRAWBACK IS ITS BATTERY BACKUP. IF YOU CAN CONSIDER SCREEN SIZE THAN GO FOR IT. SERVICE OF FLIPKART IS VERY FAST AND RELIABLE."
Xperia U,5,"ITS BEEN 4-5 DAYS I AM USING THIS PHONE.
      
      
      MEMORY ISSUE
      
      
      GET ORGANIZED-
      
      FOR PEOPLE WHO UNNECESSARILY STUFF THEIR PHONE WITH VIDS AND SONG AND OFTEN DONT ACCESS THE FILES, THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT FOR YOU. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GET ORGANIZED 1ST, BUYING THIS PHONE MUST BE A SECONDARY PRIORITY IN YOUR LIFE!
      
      
      APPS-
      
      MAJORITY OF APPS ON PLAYSTORE ARE LESS THAN 10MB. EVEN IF YOU PLAN TO USE 2GB OF 4GB FOR APPS ALONE, YOU CAN STILL STORE MORE THAN 200 APPS. ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT SEEN PEOPLE MORE THAN 20-25 ADDITIONAL APPS IN THEIR PHONES.
      
      
      ADVANTAGES
      
      I PERSONALLY GOT THIS PHONE COZ OF 1GHZ DUAL CORE CORTEX A9 WITH MALI 400. IN S3 YOU HAVE THE  1.4GHZ QUAD CORE INSTEAD OF 1 GHZ DUAL CORE, SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE VALUE FOR MONEY YOU GET WITH SONY. IT REALLY BRINGS IT CLOSER TO THE HIGH END PHONES.
      
      
      THERE IS NO LAG WHILE SWIPING. TEMPLE RUN RUNS FLAWLESSLY. LOADS HEAVY WEBPAGES EASILY WITH 14+MBPS SPEED. BIG WEBPAGES (NYTIMES) DO LAG A BIT BUT THATS NEGLIGIBLE.
      
      
      THE UI, THEME IS GREAT, IT WILL ATTRACT YOU TO SWIPE THE SCREEN AND SEE ITS LIVE WALLPAPER COME TO LIFE.
      
      
      MIND BLOWING BASS QUALITY. UFF I CAN'T DEFINE IT GUYS. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT YOURSELF. SUPER CLEAR BASS. NOT AT ALL MUDDY!
      
      
      280 PPI SCREEN GIVES RAZOR SHARP IMAGES.
      
      
      BATTERY LASTS FOR 2 DAYS WITH REDUCED BRIGHTNESS AND LIMITED USAGE.
      
      
      SUPERB RUBBERY FINISH. MUCH BETTER THAN HTC AND PLASTICY SAMSUNG SETS.
      
      
      STRONG RESPONSIVE KEYS
      
      
      DISADVANTAGES
      
      
      THE SCREEN GETS A BIT GREASY.
      
      ICS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN GINGERBREAD
      
      
      CONCLUSION
      
      MIDRANGE PHONES ARE A TRICKY BUY. UNLIKE THE HIGH END PHONE WHERE YOU GET THE BEST HARDWARE AND ONLY FIGHT ON THE BASE OF SOME SPECIAL FEATURES, HERE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE HARDWARE INSTALLED IN THEIR PHONES.
      
      SAMSUNG MAY HAVE BEEN MARKETING AGGRESSIVELY, BUT AFTER A LOT OF RESEARCH I FOUND BUYING A SAMSUNG PHONE IN THIS RANGE (DONT REMEBER THE MODEL , ITS FOR 15500 IN FLIPKART ONLY) IS NOT AT ALL WORTH. QUALCOMM CHIPS WITH ADRENO 200 GRAPHICS???? THAT TO MORE THAN 15K? JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE. MOREOVER THE SCREENS ARE ALSO DULL IN SAMSUNG MIDRANGE PHONE.
      
      
      ON THE OTHER HAND HTC TURNED ME DOWN ON A FEW FEATURES. I WANTED TO GO FOR HTC FRO ITS SCREEN SIZE AND ICS BUT STEPPED BACK COZ OF SEC CAM AND I GHZ DUAL CORE BUNDLED WITH A 280 PPI SCREEN I GOT BUYING U.
      
      
      AT LAST, THE ILLUMINATION STRIP AT THE BOTTOM DIFFERENTIATES THIS LITTLE BEAST IN THE CROWD GUYS. ITS REALLY A SIMPLE FEATURE BUT IT MAKES ONE NOTICE THAT ...?ITS U? :)"

Xperia U,5,"LOVE IT VERY MUCH!
      
      
      A MONTH AGO I WAS PLANNING TO BUY A MOBILE IN THE BUDGET RANGE OF INR 10-20K AND MY PREVIOUS MOBILE WAS SAMSUNG GALAXY POP WHICH DISAPPOINTED ME ON THE FRONT CAMERA. SO, IN THIS HUNT I WAS VERY CLEAR IN GETTING A MOBILE WITH FRONT CAMERA WHICH WILL FULFILL THE NEED OF A LAPTOP. THIS REQUIREMENT GIVES CONFUSION A BIT LESSER BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED MODELS HAVING FRONT CAMERA IN ANDROID. FINALLY I FOUND XPERIA U WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR MY  NEEDS.
      
      
      STONES HIT ME TO GET CONFUSED ARE XPERIA J AND XPERIA GO. ?GO? DOESN?T HAVE FRONT CAMERA, BAD!
      
      
      ?J? ???!!!
      
      
      STORY TIME?
      
      AN YEAR BACK WHEN I BOUGHT GALAXY POP, I WAS FOCUSED ONLY ABOUT THE FEATURES LIKE 3G, WI-FI ETC. THEN I UNDERSTOOD NOW ITS NOT ABOUT THE FEATURES, ITS ALL ABOUT CAPABILITY OF THE FEATURES. ?J? IS NOT HAVING DUAL-CORE PROCESSOR WHICH IS MANDATORY TO RUN ICS. DUE TO THIS CAUSE, VIDEO PLAYER STRUCK, VIDEO PLAYBACK WITH NO AUDIO AND SO MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE. FLIPKART USER REVIEWS HELPED ME A LOT TO UNDERSTAND THIS FROM THE DAY ONE OF ?J? RELEASE. THEN I FIXED DUAL-CORE TO MY REQUIREMENT LIST.
      
      
      XPERIA U WAS HAVING GINGERBREAD WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND IT HAS DUAL-CORE PROCESSOR. SO,  NO WAY TO DOUBT ON ITS PERFORMANCE EVEN IF WE UPGRADE IT TO ICS. EVEN THEN SAMSUNG S DUOS CAN?T COMPETE WITH THESE FEATURES PERSONALLY TO MY POINT OF VIEW, BECAUSE I HATE DUAL-SIM.
      
      
      TURNING POINT?
      
      
      I FINALIZED TO BUY ?U? AND I PLANNED TO EXPERIENCE A LITTLE IN HANDS, VISITED A MOBILE STORE. HUH! ALL MY RESEARCH GONE WASTE. I WASN?T GET ATTRACTED THIS MOBILE AND CAME BACK WITH THE DISAPPOINTMENT. I GOT THE ANSWER FOR WHY. THAT?S BECAUSE ALL THE MOBILE MODELS ARE SHOWN IN THE RACKS WHICH SHOWS ?U? NOT ATTRACTIVE THAN THE 4? AND 4.5? INCH SCREEN, ESPECIALLY SAMSUNG S3 . I VISITED SONY EXPERIENCE CENTER. AWESOME! THERE I CAN CLEARLY FOCUSED ON ?U?.
      
      
      BOUGHT IT AND EXPERIENCED THE GINGERBREAD AND PERFORMANCE WISE DOUBTFULLY UPGRADED TO ICS.  MY GUESS WAS CORRECT AND SINCE IT IS A DUAL-CORE ITS WORKING FINE WITH ICS TOO.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE, VIDEO RECORDING, CAMERA SHOTS, GAMING, HANDY, SENSITIVE, VIDEO CHATTING WITH FRONT CAMERA EVERY THING IS EXCELLENT.
      
      
      ONE AND ONLY CON:
      
      
      DUE TO THE LED BAR LIGHT BATTERY IS GETTING DOWN VERY FASTER AND IT MAKES ME TO CHARGE TWICE A DAY. SO BAD RIGHT! BATTERY USAGE DETAILS SHOWED ME MEDIA SERVER ? 70% CONSUMPTION. WHAT THE HECK IS THIS! JUST TRIED TO TURN OFF THE LED LIGHT WITH THIRD PARTY APP. EVEN AFTER THAN WHEN U GET CALL LED LIGHT GLOWS. BUT NOT ALL THE TIME WHEN U USE BACK AND HOME DOTS. NOW THE MEDIA SERVER IS JUST ? 20%. HOOORAY! HAPPY. ONLY ONCE A DAY I AM CHARGING MY ?U?. THAT IS COMMON FOR ALL SMART PHONES.
      
      
      SO FAR I AM ONLY WORRIED OF GMAIL APP. ITS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. FOR NEW MAILS U NEED TO OPEN APP AND DO REFRESH TWICE TO SEE ALL THE NEW MAILS. I DON?T THINK THAT?S U?S FAULT. IT MUST BE A BUG OF  ICS. HOPE THAT WILL ALSO GET FIXED IN THEIR UPCOMING UPDATES
      
      
      I CAN SAY ONE THING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING TO BUY A SMARTPHONE IN RANGE 10-20K, DON?T WASTE TIME ON RESEARCHING FURTHER. BUY ?U? DAMN SURE U WILL LOVE USING  IT."
Xperia U,5,"MY VIEW:
      
      
      1. GREAT SCREEN CLARITY AS IT HAS 280 PPI PIXEL DENSITY FOR 3.5 SIZE.
      
      2. AMAZING MUSIC EXPERIENCE AS IT HAS SONY BRAVIA ENGINE ENHANCEMENT.
      
      3. STYLISH LOOK WITH GOOD CONFIGURATION AND IT IS EASY TO HANDLE.
      
      4. IT IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR MID RANGE BUYERS AND IT IS ONE OF THE BEST MOBILE IN THIS RANGE."
Xperia U,5,"NICE MOBILE WITH SONY'S QUALITY. VERY GOOD DISPLAY, ERGONOMIC DESIGN, GOOD SOUND, SPEED. SUGGESTING IT FOR NEW BUYERS.NOW IT IS ONE OF THE MOST PREFERABLE MOBILE IN THE RANGE OF 10K TO 15K.GOOD BETTERY LIFE, SUPERB CAMERA QUALITY  ETC ETC"
Xperia U,5,"ORDERED THE PHONE AND GOT IT IN 2 DAYS. AMAZING FLIPKART!
      
      REGARDING THE PHONE, GOT IT NICELY PACKED, I OPENED IT AND IT HAS THE WHITE INTERCHANGEABLE BOTTOM IN THE BOX ALONG WITH SCREEN GUARD AND HEADSETS. OUT OF THE BOX IT COMES WITH 2.3.7 GINGERBREAD AND DIRECTLY CONNECTED IT TO SONY COMPANINON AND UPDATED IT TO 4.0.4 ICS. I ALSO HAVE A GALAXY S2. BOTH THE PHONE HAS SAME TECH SPECS(CPU/GPU/RAM) BUT ICS IN S2 IS A BIT BETTER THAN SONY, THOUGH IT IS NOT BAD.
      
      REGARDING ANOTHER MODELS, IT IS VERY MUCH BETTER THAN MIRO AS IT HAS VIDEO HD RECORDING, WHICH GUYS IS A MUST THESE DAYS.
      
      THE ONLY THING I AM UNHAPPY IS, THOUGH XPERIA U AND S2 RELEASED AROUND SAME TIME, MY S2 WILL RUN IN JELLY BEAN IN A NEAR FUTURE WHEREAS XPERIA U WILL REMAIN ON ICS.
      
      IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN JB, PROJECT BUTTER, YOU MAY CONSIDER XPERIA P AS IT IS LISTED IN JELLY BEAN UPDATE LIST BY SONY.
      
      
      ANYWAYS I AM HAPPY WITH MY SECOND SMART PHONE.. ICS IN SONY IS BETTER THAN GB AND INDIAN ROM IS THE BEST ONE OUT THERE. EVEN PEOPLE FROM FRANCE/GERMANY ARE INSTALLING ICS INDIAN STOCK ROM AS IT IS A BIT GOOD THAN OTHERS."
Xperia U,5,"PROS : AMAZED BY THE PRODUCT,EASE OF ACCESS,TYPING,THE SCREEN,AND EXCELLENT SPEECH  TO TEXT,GREAT PIECE OF HARDWARE THIS IS,THE WHITE STRIP LIGHTS ARE AMAZING,NOTIFICATIONS FROM A DISTANCE AND A DARK ROOM ARE ICING ON THE CAKE,WILL DEFINITELY ROOT IT AFTER WARRANTY AND GET THE LED CTRL APP,AMAZING IT IS..
      
      
      CON
      
      BATTERY LASTING JUST ONE DAY WITH REGULAR USE,WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER WITH MORE BACK UP..
      
      
      VERDICT : FOR THE PRICING,ITS A GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT."
Xperia U,5,"REALLY GR8 PRODUCT ,MUST BUY IF YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH 4GB STORAGE. FOR ME 4GB IS MORE THAN ENOUGH. .CAMERA IS DECENT NOT THAT GR8 ,NOT BAD EITHER. CALL QUALITY IS CRYSTAL CLEAR ,LOOK AND FEEL IS AWESOME ,ITS LIGHTWEIGHT . BETTER THAN MOST MOBILE PHONES IN THIS RANGE. GO FOR IT."
Xperia U,5,"SEE AS SIMPLE AS THAT, ITS NOT FOR THOSE HIGH-ENDED PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO KEEP TONS OF DATA ON THEIR FONE FOR WHICH THEY ARE CRYING FOUL OVER THE LESS STORAGE.I PERSONALLY FIND 4 GB MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR MY FILE STORAGE ON TOP OF IT SONY PROVIDES ADDITIONAL 2GB SORAGE FOR APPLICTAIONS, WHICH, IN OTHER FONES IS AROUND 170-200MB APPROX.SO GUYS IF UR BUDGET IS AROUND 16-18K THIS IS THE BEST DEAL U CAN GET IN FONES IN THE PRESENT MARKET.U WONT BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL.SERIOUSLY, AS SATYA KEERTHY SAID, SUM1 MUST BE A FOOL TO OPT OUT OF BUYING THIS FONE JUST BECOZ OF THE PETTY MEMORY ISSUE.THE BATTERY ALSO LASTS EASILY 1 TO 1.5 DAYS WITH SAOME BASIC TWEAKS FOR POWER CONSUMPTION.AND ANOTHER GOOD NEWS THAT WHEN IT'LL GET ITS UPDATE TO ICS ANDROID 4.0, ITS BATTERY PERFORMANCE WILL INCREASE FURTHERMORE, SO NOTHING TO WORRY ABOT REGARDING THE BATTERY TOO."

      4GB USER SPACE IS JUST ENOUGH AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF A SLOT FOR MICRO SD IS PROVIDED JUST IN CASE IF U R MUSIC LOVER AND HAVE SONGS AND STUFF WEIGHING MORE THAN 4GB."
Xperia U,5,"SONY XPERIA U HAS BEEN ONE THE TOP SELLING AND THE MOST POPULAR PHONE FROM SONY.
      
      SONY PROVIDES QUALITY PRODUCTS. ALL THE PRODUCTS INSIDE THE BOX ARE OF TOP NOTCH QUALITY.
      
      YOU GET ADDITIONAL CHANGABLE BOTTOM CAP + RINGO EARPHONES + SCREEN PROTECTOR IN THE BOX
      
      
      POSITIVES:
      
      
      -&GT; EXCELLENT SCREEN RESOLUTION. IMAGES ARE INDEED VERY CRISP AND CLEAR (ALTHOUGH THE COLOUR SATURATION IS SLIGHTLY ON THE HIGHER SIDE). EQUIPPED WITH MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE.
      
      
      -&GT; ILLUMINATION STRIP. EYE CATCHER AND IS GOOD FOR NOTIFICATIONS. LOTS OF APPS AVAILABLE ON GOOGLE PLAY TO CHANGE THE COLOUR OF ILLUMINATION STRIP FOR DIFFERENT NOTIFICATIONS/APPS.
      
      
      -&GT; PRETTY FAST PROCESSOR. 1GHZ + DUAL CORE NEVER LETS YOU DOWN ON PERFORMANCE
      
      
      -&GT; MALI 400MP GPU - ONE OF THE BEST GPUS AROUND. PROVIDES SMOOTH GAMING EXPERIENCE. THE QUADRANT BENCHMARK SCORES FOR MY XPERIA U TURNED OUT TO BE 2828, WHICH IS BETTER THAN HTC ONE V.
      
      
      -&GT; TOUCHSCREEN - EXCELLENT TOUCH RESPONSES INTERCEPTED BY THE SCREEN. NO LAGS AT ALL. OH YES, THE SCREEN IS SCRATCH RESISTANT AND THERE IS AN ANTI-REFLECTION COATING ON THE MINERAL GLASS TOO.
      
      
      -&GT; CAMERA - CLICKS FABULOUS PHOTOS UNDER DAYLIGHT BUT SOMEWHAT GRAINY PHOTOS UNDER LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS. FLASH LIGHT IS EXCEPTIONALLY BRIGHT. THERE IS PANORAMA, 3D PANORAMA, SMILE DETECTION AND LOTS OF OTHER FEATURES WHICH MAKE A VERY GOOD CAMERA PACKAGE.
      
      SECONDARY CAMERA WORKS FINE WHEN MAKING VIDEO CALLS OVER WIFI OR 3G.
      
      VIDEO RECORDING @720P - GREAT VIDEO QUALITY.
      
      
      -&GT; OS - COMES WITH GINGERBREAD OUT OF THE BOX BUT YOU CAN UPDATE THE OS TO ICS USING SONY COMPANION PC SOFTWARE. SONY HAS BEEN ONE THE MOST LOYAL MANUFACTURERS THAT ROLLS OUT UPDATES FOR ANY BUG FIXES, IF REQUIRED, UNLIKE MICROMAX, KARBONN WHICH WILL BE PERMANENTLY STUCK WITH BUGS IN THEIR OS.
      
      
      -&GT; NETWORK RECEPTION - NO ISSUES WITH NETWORK RECEPTION. 2G AND 3G DATA WORK FLAWLESSLY.
      
      
      -&GT; BATTERY - ALTHOUGH IT HOUSES A SLIGHTLY SMALLER BATTERY (1320 MAH) THAN EXPECTED, IT CAN LAST A DAY EASILY. WITH THE ICS UPDATE COMES AN 'EXTENDED STANDBY MODE'. TURN IT ON AND YOUR BATTERY STANDBY TIMES INCREASE 3 FOLD. WITH HEAVY USAGE, THE JUICE LASTS A DAY, BUT WITH MODERATE USAGE IT LASTS 1.5 DAYS EASILY.
      
      
      -&GT; IN BUILT APPS - A FEW INBUILT APPS ARE GOOD BUT THE REST CAN BE REMOVED. YES, SONY HAS BEEN GENEROUS ENOUGH TO ALLOW ITS USERS TO REMOVE INBUILT APPS. INTERNAL MEMORY FOR APPS IS 2 GB !!!!
      
      
      -&GT; WALKMAN - MUSIC IS WAY BETTER THAN THOSE MICROMAX, SAMSUNG PHONES. GOOD PRE-SET EQUALIZERS + 3D SOUND ENHANCEMENTS + GOOD ENOUGH RINGO EARPHONES + ILLUMINATION STRIP MAKE YOUR MUSIC EXPERIENCE WONDERFUL.
      
      I AM USING SOUNDMAGIC ES 18 EARPHONES WITH XPERIA U (THAT MAKES A DEADLY COMBINATION :D)
      
      
      -&GT; USB OTG- ON THE GO (OTG), LETS YOU CONNECT YOUR PENDRIVE, USB MOUSE/KEYBOARD WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE ON EVEN HIGHER PRICE BRACKET PHONES.
      
      
      -&GT; BUILD QUALITY - GOOD RUBBERIZED FINISH AT THE BACK MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD WHILE HOLDING. BUILD IS FAR BETTER THAN THOSE PLASTICY SAMSUNG PHONES.
      
      
      NEGATIVES:
      
      
      -&GT; 3.5 "" SCREEN MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR SOME PEOPLE WHILE TYPING BUT SONY XPERIA U HAS SWYPE KEYBOARD PRE-INSTALLED WHICH MAKES TYPING MUCH EASIER.
      
      
      -&GT; NO OS UPGRADATION - YES, ITS OFFICIAL, THERE WILL BE NO JELLY BEAN FOR XPERIA U. BUT, THERE ARE NO DRASTIC CHANGES IN JELLY BEAN AS COMPARED TO ICS SO I GUESS ICS IS FAIR ENOUGH. THERE ARE A FEW BUGS IN ICS BUT SONY IS GOING TO ROLL OUT UPDATES FOR XPERIA U, SOLA AND GO TO RECTIFY A FEW BUGS. THE UPDATES HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED AND SHALL BE AVAILABLE SOON.
      
      
      -&GT; FIXED STORAGE MEMORY OF 8GB - USER MEDIA STORAGE IS JUST 4GB BUT WITH USB OTG YOU CAN EXPAND YOUR MEMORY WHENEVER YOU WANT.
      
      
      OVERALL, I WOULD HAPPILY GIVE 4.5 STARS AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO THOSE WHO SEEK QUALITY, GOOD ENOUGH PERFORMANCE, GOOD CAMERA, MODERATELY SIZED SCREEN AND AN EXCELLENT MUSIC EXPERIENCE....."
Xperia U,5,"THE BEST IN THIS RANGE.I AM USING THIS SINCE LAST 8 MONTHS. WORKS FLUIDIC FAST AND BLAZINGLY BRIGHT.. BEST THING IS ITS SO SOPHISTICATED AND WOAH DESIGN.. ITS A KILLER PHONE.
      
      NFS MW , ASPHALT 7 WORKS GREAT..
      
      P.S- DONT UPGRADE IT INTO ICS..GB WORKS GREAT.. ICS WILL KILL THIS PHONE. :)"
Xperia U,5,"THE PHONE FEELS NICE IN THE HAND. IT DRAWS ATTENTION FROM ALMOST ALL THOSE WHO SEE IT BECAUSE OF THE ILLUMINATING TRANSPERENT BAR WHICH IS ASTONISHING. I AGREE TO ALL THE PROS POSTED BY THE USERS BUT NOT ALL THE CONS BUT HERE ARE SOME EXTRA ONES.
      
      PROS:
      
      1) ALL THE PROS OF OTHER USERS
      
      2) IT HAS THE GRAPHIC PROCESSING UNIT SAME AS THAT USED IN SAMSUNG GALAXY S3. WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO PLAY ALMOST ALL HD GAMES (NOT ALL).
      
      3)SUPER BRIGHT AND CRISP CLARITY OF VIDEOS AND PHOTOS (THANKS TO BRAVIA ENGINE).
      
      4) BRAND NAME SONY MAKES IT STAND OUT OF THE CROWD.
      
      5) HIGH QUALITY SNAPS IN DAYLIGHT WITH SMILE AND FACE DETECTION.
      
      6) 4 FINGER MULTI TOUCH (USEFULL IN APPS LIKE PIANO)
      
      7) SYNCS TRACK INFO, ARTIST NAME,ALBUM ETC. FOR MUSIC AND CAN CLASSIFY INTO DIFFEERNT MOODS LIKE RELAX, DANCE, NIGHT ETC SO THAT U CAN LISTEN ACCORDING TO YOUR MOOD.
      
      8) BOOST CHARGING- CHARGES FROM BATTERY BELOW 10% TO 100% IN LESS THAN 1.5 HRS!!
      
      9) ABILITY TO TAKE 3D PICTURES AND DISPLAY IT IN 3D TV.
      
      10) CAPTURES HIGH RESOLUTION VIDEOS
      
      11) SMALL LED APART FROM ILLUMINATING BAR TO INFORM CHARGE STATUS, NOTIFICATION ETC.
      
      12) YOU CAN TAKE A PHOTOSHOT FROM YOUR OFF SCREEN IN JUST LESS THAN 2 SECS.
      
      13) ILLUMINATING BAR CHANGES COLOUR ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT THEMES, PICTURES , ALBUMS, SONGS ETC.
      
      14) AUTOMATICALLY UPDATES YOUR PHONE CALENDER WITH FACEBOOK BIRTHDAYS AND REMINDS YOU ON THAT DAY, UPDATES THEIR PROFILE PIC AS THE CALLER ID AND LOTS OF STUFFS.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) STILL THE UPDATE FOR ICS IS NOT ROLLED OUT FOR MY SI NO.
      
      2) I FIND THAT THE RAM RUNS OUT OF MEMORY AFTER CONTINUOUS USAGE AND I ALWAYS HAVE TO RESTART THE PHONE TO SPEED IT UP. I DO IT ATLEAST TWICE A DAY.
      
      3) THE PHONE RESTARTS ITSELF SOMETIMES. WEIRD!!
      
      4) SOMETIMES WHEN I HEAR MUSIC THROUGH HEADPHONES, AND A CALL COMES, THE PHONE GETS STUCK AND I HAVE TO RESTART IT.
      
      5) ZOOMING IN VIDEO CAMERA IS BAD AND IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO USE THE HARDWARE SHUTTER KEY FOR CAMERA DUE TO ITS RIGIDITY.
      
      6) THE LOUD SPEAKER SOUND IS QUITE LOW EVEN IF XLOUD IS ON.
      
      7) HIGH RADIATION LEVEL.
      
      
      I HIGHLY RECOMMED THIS PHONE TO EVERYONE. THE CONS ARE NOT MAJOUR ONES AND I AM USED WITH IT. THANKS.
      
      8) HEADPHONE QUALITY NOT UPTO THE MARK WE EXPECT FRPM SONY."
Xperia U,5,"THE PHONE PERFORMS SLOWER THAN USUAL BECOZ OF LESS FREE RAM.
      
      1) AFTER UPGRADING CHECK UR FREE RAM....SETTINGS-&GT;APPS-&GT;RUNNING (IT WILL SHOW ~50 MB)
      
      2) SWITCH OFF THE PHONE AND REMOVE THE SIM.
      
      3) TURN ON THE PHONE AND RESET FACTORY SETTINGS (NO NEED TO DELETE DATA THOUGH)
      
      4) LET THE PHONE RESTART AND THEN TURN IT OFF
      
      5) INSERT SIM AND START THE PHONE
      
      6) CHECK FREE RAM ( SHUD BE ~150 MB)
      
      AND U R DONE............THIS IS THE PROBLEM FOR ALL ANDROID PHONES AFTER UPGRADING."
Xperia U,5,"THE SMART PHONE SONY XPERIA U,HAS A POWERFUL 1GHZ,DUAL CORE,THAT DELIVERS AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE. IT HAS BEAUTIFUL SCREEN DISPLAY (BRAVIA ENGINE) THAT GIVES YOU EVERY DETAIL ON ANYTHING..
      
      XPERIA-U CONTAINS 5MP PRIMARY CAMERA,THIS CAMERA DELIVERS A PICTURE QUALITY MORE THAN FULL-HD,AND CAPTURE PICS VERY FAST IN QUICK LAUNCH MODE. THIS PHONE ALSO SHOOTS VIDEO IN HD QUALITY(1280X720P).XPERIA-U HAS A SECONDARY CAMERA OF STANDARD QUALITY(0.3MP).

Xperia U,5,"THIS IS VERY NICE PHONE. THE TIMESCAPE UI IS JUST AWESOME. AS PEOPLE USE TO COMPARE THIS PHONE WITH XPERIA J, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS ONE HAS GOT MORE TALENT (FEATURES). XPERIA J HAS OLD CRAP CORTEX A5 WHILE IT HAS DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, J HAS ADRENO 200 WHILE U HAS GOT MALI 400 WHICH IS MUCH MORE BETTER THAN ADRENO 200.
      
      I HAVE TRIED IT HANDS ON. IT HAS VERY SMOOTH UI PLUS  GOOD MULTITASK HANDLING.
      
      
      ABOUT MEMORY, SADLY USER WILL GET ONLY 4 GB FOR THEIR FILES AND ETC, 2 GB FOR GAMES AND APPS AND 2 GB FOR OS STUFFS. BUT GOOD THING IS THAT IT HAS GOT USB ON THE GO. IF YOU LIKE TO CARRY A AN USB DRIVE (PENDRIVE) AND A CONNECTOR WITH YOU, IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL AND EASIER FOR YOU TO PLAY MULTIMEDIA FILES AND TRANSFER FILES.
      
      
      IT HAS GOT GOOD CAMERA AND ALSO 720P HD VIDEO RECORDING TOO!
      
      
      THUS FOR 14490 ? ITS A BANG FOR BUCKS...!!!"
Xperia U,5,"THIS PHONE HAS GOT EVERYTHING I WISHED FOR. A 1 GHZ DUAL CORE CPU ENSURES THAT U CAN MULTITASK SEAMLESSLY(IT DOES GETS SOME HICCUPS BTW), A GPU THAT SUPPORTS PLAYING ALL KINDS OF GAMES, A CRISPY DISPLAY AND A VERY GOOD CAMERA. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT DOESN'T SUPPORT A MICROSD CARD SO FORGET ABOUT EXPANDING THE MEMORY. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE FOR HARDCORE GAMERS AS MANY HD GAMES TAKE UP A HUGE CHUNK OF SPACE. BUT I'M JUST A CASUAL GAMER AND SATISFIED WITH TEMPLE RUN, ANGRY BIRDS ETC. THIS PHONE IS EVEN UPGRADABLE TO ANDROID 4.0 ICS, HAVEN'T UPGRADED IT MYSELF THOUGH BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
      
      IN SHORT------  ""I JUST LOVE THIS PHONE...!!!!!!!!!!"""
Xperia U,5,"THIS PHONE IS GIVING MALI 400 MP GRAPHIC PROCESSOR, WHICH IS THE SAME USED BY SAMSUNG GALAXY S3, WITH ICS AT 13K ITS GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY!!!!!,MY FRIEND HAS IT, AND I WAS PLAYING ""TEMPLE RUN 2""ON IT, GAMES RUN VERY SMOOTH ON THIS PHONE, WITHOUT ANY LAG LIKE, GO FOR IT IF YOUR BUDGET SUPPORT IT, THIS PHONE INITIALLY WHEN LAUNCHED WAS AROUND 15-16K !!!!!!!!"
Xperia U,5,"THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN WRITTEN BASED ON PRICE OF MOBILE WHICH IS UNDER13K
      
      
      1-	PROCESSOR (10/10)- GREAT PROCESSOR @12999 RS - 1 GHZ ARM CORTEX-A9, DUAL CORE. MOBILE UNDER 13K WITH 1 GHZ, DUAL CORE PROCESSOR THIS IS THE ONLY ONE (AMONG SAMSUNG, HTC, SONY), ONE MORE MOBILE WITH DUAL CORE PROCESSOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S ADVANCE I9070(AROUND 13500 RS) BUT XPERIA ? U IS BETTER.
      
      
      2-	RAM (9.5/10) ?512MB RAM IS NOT ENOUGH BUT HOW CAN YOU EXPECT 1GB RAM WITH A PHONE UNDER 13K SO IT?S GOOD WITH 512MB RAM.
      
      
      3-	CAMERA (10/10) ?
      
      A.	PRIMARY CAMERA - 5 MEGAPIXEL WITH DIGITAL ZOOM - 16X GOOD ENOUGH FOR SNAPPING WITH AUTO FOCUS, 3D SWEEP PANORAMA ETC..
      
      B.	SECONDARY CAMERA - 0.3 MEGAPIXEL ? UNDER 13K A PHONE WITH SECONDARY CAMERA NOT VGA IT?S 0.3 MP IT?S GREAT
      
      C.	RECORDING ? VIDEO RECORDING WITH 1280 X 720, 30 FPS WOULD BE GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR SUCH A CHIP PHONE.
      
      
      4-	OS (10/10) - ANDROID V2.3 (GINGERBREAD), UPGRADABLE TO V4.0 (ICE CREAM SANDWICH)
      
      
      5-	BATTERY (8.5/10) - LI-ION, 1320 MAH BATTERY FOR VERY HEAVY USER IT?S NOT GREAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR SOME OTHER PHONE FOR HEAVY USE, BUT YOU WILL NOT GET ALL THOSE KEY FEATURE WHICH IS THERE IN THIS MOBILE.
      
      
      6-	DISPLAY (10/10) TFT 3.5 INCH FWVGA, 854 X 480 PIXELS LOOKS LIKE GREAT DISPLAY WITH 16 M COLOR SCRATCH-RESISTANT, SCREENSHOT CAPTURING, ANTI-REFLECTION COATING ON MINERAL GLASS, MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE
      
      
      OVER ALL GOOD PHONE AVAILABLE IN MARKET NOW UNDER 13K, IF YOU HAVE BUDGET AROUND 15K-18K GO FOR XPERIA L (18.5 K) NEWLY LAUNCHED(MAY-2013)
      
      
      THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN WRITTEN BASED ON PRICE OF MOBILE WHICH IS UNDER13K"
Xperia U,5,VERY GOOD SUPER FAST.3G NETWORK GOOD SPEED.TOUCHSCREEN SUPER.AND CAMERA GOOD. SECONDARY CAMERA NICE.THE BATTERY ALSO LASTS EASILY 1 TO 1.5 DAYS WITH SAOME BASIC TWEAKS FOR POWER CONSUMPTION.SOUND QUALITY IS ALSO BRILLIANT.
Xperia U,5,"WELL FIRST OF ALL MY COMMENT WILL GO WITH MY TITLE, THIS PHONE IS WORTH ITS PRICE. FOR A MID BUDGET PHONE IT SURE PACKS A PUNCH. ITS FEATURES CAN BE COMPARED WITH THE PHONES AROUND 20K.
      
      LIKE: 1) OTHER PHONES @ 12K MAY HAVE 1GHZ PROCESSORS, BUT 90% OF THEM DON,T HAVE A9,DUAL CORE OR ITS EQUIVALENT.
      
      2)IT HAS MALI400MP. IT CAN BE COMPARED WITH ADRENO 220. BUT @12K 95% HAVE ADRENO 205.
      
      IT HAS SO MANY OTHER FEATURES THAT I CAN WRITE DOWN. BUT I WILL SAY TO THOSE WHO ARE ABOUT TO BUY A NEW PHONE @12K BUDGET AND ARE FOND OF SONY, GO FOR THIS PHONE. YOU WILL DEFINITELY LIKE IT.
      
      
      ****//FOR THOSE WHO COMMENTS IT AS A BAD PHONE, THEY ARE EITHER TOTAL NOOB OR VERY RICH FOR THIS PHONE. BECAUSE IF THEY ARE CHALLENGED TO FIND A BETTER PHONE AT THE SAME PRICE, THEY WILL DEFINITELY LOOSE.//****"
Xperia U,5,WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS PHONE IT WAS GOOD N FAST BUT IT IS GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY ICS ON DIS PHONE SUX CAMERA DOES NT WORK TOTALLY DISSAPOINTED STILL BETTER DAN OTHER PHONES IN DIS PRICE AND NOT DA WORST IN THE MARKET.PROBABLY DIS SAVES IT FRM GETTING 1 STAR
Xperia U,5,"XPERIA U IS AN AMAZINGLY GOOD LOOKING AND SUPERB QUALITY PHONE. I PURCHASED IT FOR MY WIFE IN JAN 2013 AND HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPILY USING IT SINCE THEN. ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUES. ITS FEATURES ARE:
      
      1. FREE UPDATE TO ICE CREAM SAND WITCH
      
      2. FEELS GREAT WHEN YOU HOLD IT, ITS MATERIAL IS VERY EASY TO CLEAN.
      
      3. FAST PROCESSING, NO LAG
      
      4. CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY HIGH, YOU CAN SHOOT HD VIDEO. ALL KINDS OF PHOTO SHOOT FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE
      
      5. ITS GLOWING LIGHT IS JUST WONDERFUL. IN THE NIGHT IT LOOKS YOU ARE HOLDING A STAR IN YOUR HANDS.
      
      6. BATTERY BACK UP IS GOOD.
      
      7. IT HAS GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH SPACE FOR A NORMAL USERS. IF YOU ARE CRAZY ABOUT APPS, ETC. THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.
      
      8. GOOGLE MAPS, WHATS APP MESSENGER, SONY WALKMAN MUSIC
      
      IF YOU BUY IT, YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT. SONY HAS PUT VERY GOOD QUALITY STUFF INSIDE IT.
      
      REGARDS,

Xperia U,4,"1. ICS SAVES BATTERY A HELL LOT COMPARED TO ITS PREDECESSOR GB 2.3.
      
      USE PC COMPANION BUT IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME SO USED SONY UPDATE SERVICE AND IT WORKED
      
      LIKE CHARM.
      
      2. BATTERY LASTS A WHOLE DAY WITH WI-FI ON AND SPORADIC BURST OF SOCIAL ACTIVITY.
      
      3. WHY DID SONY NOT PROVIDE USB ON THE GO CABLE? I PERSONALLY FEEL THEY SHOULD.
      
      4. I HAVE USED EARLIER VERSIONS OF SONY MINUS ANDROID AND NOKIA, I MUST SAY THIS BEING MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE I WAS SIMPLY BLOWN AWAY. I UPDATED THE OS TO ICS WITHIN A DAY OF USAGE AND WAS ADDICTED TO PHONE FOR INTIAL 3-4 DAYS TRYING TO GET HANG OF FEATURES AND WAS SIMPLY BLOWN AWAY.
      
      
      NICE PHONE FOR THIS BUDGET. BUT ANDROID TO SEEMS POWERFUL ONLY WITH INTERNET SO GET A GOOD INTERNET PLAN, DOWNLOAD ONLY THOSE APPS WHICH YOU NEED OR ARE INTERESTED BUT DONT GET ADDICTED TO IT. HAVE FUN. CHEERS!!"
Xperia U,4,"A VERY GOOD PHONE IN TOTALITY..
      
      BUT THE CAMERA BUTTON IS A LIL STIFF &AMP; HANGS OCCASIONALLY...

Xperia U,4,"ALL THE REVIEWS WRITTEN INTO THIS SECTION IS VERY CORRECT. MEMORY IS NOT AT ALL AN ISSUE, BUT BATTERY IS REALLY A PROBLEM IN THIS PHONE. IT CAN BE UPDATED SMOOTHLY TO ICS. NICE EXPERIENCE TO HAVE A SONY EXPERIA U."

      BUT REMEMBER ONE THING THOSE WHO WANT FRONT CAMERA THEY SHOULD BE AWAY FROM XPERIA SOLA."
Xperia U,4,"AWESOME MOBILE WITH MANY FEATURES......
      
      
      POSITIVE:
      
      
      1. GREAT CAMERA
      
      2. AWESOME DISPLAY QUALITY
      
      3. GREAT INTERNET EXPERIENCE
      
      4. SLEEK &AMP; SEXY LOOK
      
      5. VERY FAST PROCESSING
      
      
      CONS:
      
      
      1. NO MEMORY EXTEND
      
      2. NOT A GREAT MUSIC PLAYER
      
      3. BATTERY WITH AVERAGE PERFORMANCE
      
      
      IN A NUTSHELL, THIS PHONE IS VALUE FOR MONEY......"
Xperia U,4,"BEFORE WRITING MY REVIEW.. I WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT ""NO PRODUCT OR PHONE IS 100% PERFECT. EVERY PRODUCT WILL HAVE PRO'S AND CONS.. IT ALL DEPEND ON WE,BASED ON OUR REQUIREMENT"".
      
      
      BEFORE GOING FOR PRO'S, LET ME PUT THE CONS.
      
      1. BATTERY IS POOR. I AM CHARGING IT TWICE IN A DAY
      
      2. MANY WILL INCLUDE MEMORY CONSTRAINT IN CON'S LIST.. BUT IT IS SUPPORTING OTG (SO U CAN CONNECT A PENDRIVE TO THIS). BUT STILL IT IS A DIS ADV FOR MANY PEOPLE.
      
      
      PRO'S:
      
      1. PROCESSING SPEED IS GOOD
      
      2. IT SUPPORTS ALMOST EVERY GAME EX. TEMPLE RUN (WHICH NEED GUD GRAPHICS)
      
      3. CLARITY IS GOOD AND VERY IMPRESSIVE
      
      4. MOST IMPORTANT.. 'LUKS'. AWESOME. (IT WUD BE SUPERB IF IT IS 3.7 INCH)
      
      
      IF YOU CAN COMPROMISE WITH SECONDARY CAM, THEN HTC ONE IS ALSO A GUD ONE IN THIS LEAGUE.
      
      
      NOTE: IMO SAMSUNG MOBILES HAVE GOOD FEATURES BUT QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT SATISFACTORY."
Xperia U,4,"BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM A PREMIUM STORE 2 DAYS BACK.
      
      LETS JUST GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT, WITH PRAISING OR WRITING HATE COMMENTS.
      
      1. GOOD DESIGN, SIMPLE AND SLEEK. BUT 3.5 INCH SCREEN IS JUST OKAY. IT SHOULD BE ATLEAST 3.7 INCH. SO TRY HAVING A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PHONE BEFORE ORDERING.
      
      
      2. DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, MALI 400 GPU. BREAD AND BUTTER. GAMES WONT HANG AND DELIVER GREAT FPS. BUT WORST THING IS LOW RAM. YOUR PHONE MIGHT DELIVER SLOWER PERFORMANCE I.E DELAY IN LAUNCHING APPS ETC.
      
      
      3.FRONT CAMERA 5 MP DELIVERS GOOD SHOTS, BUT FRONT CAMERA IS PATHETIC, VGA. WITH LOWER FRAME RATES.
      
      
      4.UPGRADABLE TO ICS. UPGRADED AS SOON AS I BOUGHT.
      
      5. RESOLUTION IS GOOD, APPROX 280 PPI FOR DELIVERING CRISPY DISPLAY AND COUPLED WITH BRAVIA ENGINE. JUST AWESOME.
      
      6. SOUND QUALITY IS OK. HEADPHONES ARE GOOD THOUGH.
      
      
      FINAL REVIEW.
      
      
      GO FOR IT, BEST GADGET ON THIS PRICE. BUT TRY IT ONCE IN LOCAL SHOW ROOM,U COULD TRY DUMMY TO CHECK SCREEN SIZE. 1 LESS STARJ UST BECAUSE OF LOWER RAM"
Xperia U,4,"BROUGHT THIS PHONE RECENTLY FROM FLIPKART. THE PHONE IS GREAT IN THIS RANGE, IF YOU COMPARE OTHER PHONE ITS PERFORMANCE IS REALLY NICE, PLUS YOU ARE GETTING A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR, GRAPHICS CARD, SONY UI IS AWESOME COMPARED TO OTHERS. BATTERY BACKUP IS AVERAGE. LOVE THE COLOR CHANGING FEATURE OF THE TRANSPARENT LIGHT BAND.
      
      
      ONE THING WHICH I WOULD DEFINITELY I LIKE TO SHARE IS AFTER UPGRADING TO ICE CREAM SANDWICH, THE PERFORMANCE HAS DEGRADED LITTLE, BUT IF YOU KNOW HOW TO KEEP YOUR RAM FREE FROM THE UNNECESSARY PROCESSES YOU WONT SUFFER. THE ONLY PROBLEM WHICH I AM SUFFERING AFTER UPGRADING IS THE NETWORK, AFTER EVERY PHONE CALL THE NETWORK GOES TO ZERO AND AGAIN COMES BACK IN AROUND 8-10 SEC. REST ALL IS FINE :) :)"
Xperia U,4,"COMPARED THIS WITH PHONES LIKE GALAXY S DUOS, HTC ONE V, MOTOROLA DEFY. THIS PHONE IS WAY BETTER THIS IN MOST OF THE TERMS. THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE I FOUND WITH THIS PHONE IS THAT IT DOESN'T VE EXPANDABLE MEMORY SLOT, IF SONY MAKES THIS SMALL CHANGE THEN THIS CAN RATED 10/10"
Xperia U,4,"CONS

      ...............................................................
      
      OVER ALL GOOD PHONE 7.5/10"
Xperia U,4,EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE LOOKS GR8. I'VE CHECK EVERYTHING AND HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT IT WHETHER ITS THE EXTERNAL LOOK OR THE WAY IT HANDLE ALL THE TASKS. THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I'VE DETECTED IS THAT AT TIMES IT DOES NOT REGISTER THE SIM CARD WHICH CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEM SINCE THEN I COULD NOT RECEIVE ANY CALLS OR MESSAGES. THIS PROBLEM CAN ONLY BE SOLVED AFTER SWITCHING THE PHONE OFF AND ON AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OTHER USERS ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM BUT HOPES THAT THE SONY WORK ON THIS MINOR GLITCH IN THE PHONE.
Xperia U,4,"FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO TELL THAT I AM USING THIS PHONE FOR 5-6 MONTHSAND IT IS A VERY GOOD PHONE.
      
      YOU CAN SEE ALL THE PROS ABOVE IN THE INFORMATION GIVEN BY FLIPKART BUT THEY HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT THE CONS -
      
      1 FROM THE TIME WHEN I UPDATED IT TO ICE CREAM SANDWICH 4.0.7 OS IT HAS STARTED HANGING UP WHEN WE MAKE A CALL OR RECEIVE THE CALLS
      
      2 SOME TIMES ITS BATTERY FINISHES VERY FAST(BUT ONLY VERY FEW TIMES)
      
      3 SOME TIMES I FEEL THAT STORAGE SHOULD HAD BEEN MINIMUM 8GB
      
      
      JUST THESE THREE CONS ACCORDING TO ME BUT LEAVING THESE 3 IT IS THE BEST PHONE"
Xperia U,4,"GOT IT A COUPLE OF DAYS BACK...HERE ARE THE PROS AND CONS
      
      
      POSITIVE
      
      
      1.AMAZING COLOR DISPLAY WHEN YOU SEE PHOTOS.
      
      2.NICE CAMERA QUALITY (5 MP)
      
      3.1 GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR. FAST ENOUGH TO EXECUTE APPLICATIONS INSIDE
      
      4.NICE USER INTERFACE
      
      5.BUDGET PHONE
      
      6.GOOD SOUND QUALITY IF YOU USE IT WITH SONY OR PANASONIC HANDS FREES.
      
      
      NEGATIVE
      
      
      1.RING TONE SOUND IS LOW FOR INCOMING CALLS IN COMPARE TO SAMSUNG AS THE SPEAKER IS AT THE BACK OF THE PHONE, WHICH LOWS THE RING TONE SOUND.
      
      2.EXTERNAL MEMORY SLOT IS MISSING. ONLY 4 GB INTERNAL MEMORY, WHICH I DON'T THINK IS SUFFICIENT FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO STORES LOT OF MUSIC AND RELATED VIDEOS IN THE PHONE.
      
      3.BATTERY LIFE IS 1 DAY ONLY. EVERY NIGHT I HAVE TO CHARGE IT
      
      (THOUGH I'VE SET THE BRIGHTNESS TO 60%).
      
      4.SIM CARD SLOT IS REALLY ANNOYING IN CASE YOU WANT TO TAKE THE EXISTING SIM OUT AND PUT THE ANOTHER ONE IN IT.
      
      
      OVERALL IT'S A NICE PHONE AND I WILL SURELY RECOMMEND IT."
Xperia U,4,GREAT PHONE!!!!! LOVE THE DESIGN AND THE CHANGEABLE BOTTOM CAPS. REALLY LIKED THE IDEA OF THE TRANSPARENT STRIP ABOVE THE BOTTOM CAP. PRETTY DECENT PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CAMERA. ONLY ISSUE WAS THE MEMORY AND NOT HAVING AN OPTION TO EXTEND THE MEMORY THRU AN SD CARD. ONE OF THE BEST IN THE PRICE RANGE IF U DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE MEMORY.
Xperia U,4,GUYS PLS TELL ME WHAT IS THE COLLOUR OF THIS FONE? IS THE BACKSIDE TOTALLY WHITE??? PLS DO REPLY ASAP.. I AM THINKING OF BUYING THIS ONE SO I NEED TO KNOW IF ITS WHITE OR NOT!!!! I NEED THE WHITE ONE SO PLS REPLY ASAP
Xperia U,4,"GUYS,FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE RAM PROBLEMS,JUST DOWNLOAD THE SMART RAM BOOSTER FROM PLAY STORE AND U'LL BE AMAZED TO SEE UR PHONE PERFORMANCE..IT WORKS GR8...I WAS HAVING A FREE RAM OF JUST 50-60 MB...BUT AFTER THIS APP I CAN GET A FREE RAM OF 150-170.. EVEN THOUGH I CONTINUOUSLY RUN 2-3 APPS ALWAYS...MY PHONE IS PERFORMING GR8 AND I BET IT LL WORK WITH URS...HAV A GR8 DAY"
Xperia U,4,"HAD BOUGHT THIS BACK IN DEC 2012. ITS NOW RUNNING IN ICS WHICH IS EASILY UPGRADEABLE BY SONY UPDATE CENTRE!

Xperia U,4,"HEY GUYS , THIS IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE DOUBT ABOUT USING OTG. FOR USING OTG U HAVE TO BUY THE CABLE AS IT IS NT INCLUDED ALONG WITH THE PHONE.

Xperia U,4,"HEY GUYS,

      PROS:-
      
      1. AMAZING TOUCH, U CAN EVEN INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TOUCH I SELECTED 60% AND ITS LIKE WOOOOOOOOOOO.

      4.MUSIC
      
      ITS LOUD AND CRYSTAL CLEAR WITH 3D SURROUND SOUND
      
      
      5.LED FLASH IS LIKE MINI HALOGEN LIGHT FOR 2-3 MILI-SECONDS
      
      
      AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS SUPERB
      
      
      CONS:-
      
      1. CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT TOO GREAT BUT ITS DECENT ENOUGH
      
      
      2. YOU TUBE IS A LIL SLOWER THAN OTHER SMARTPHONES
      
      
      3. KEYPAD IS NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY BUT ITS ACCEPTABLE
      
      
      THATS IT FROM MY SIDE, GO FOR IT IF U HAVE MAXIMUM BUDGET UPTO 16K
      
      HIT IF U LIKED MY RIVIEW"
Xperia U,4,"HI ALL, I BOUGHT PHONE ARND THE TIME IT WAS LAUNCHED (SOMETIME ARND MAY-JUNE THIS YEAR) FROM THE OPEN MARKET AND NOT FROM FLIPKART. BUT I WAS JST GOIN THRU D REVIEWS AND THOUGHT WHY NT WRITE ONE MYSLF. I HAV BEEN USING THIS PHONE 4 NEARLY 6 MONTHS NOW AND APART FROM A SLIGHT ISSUE WITH D TOUCH, WHICH STRTED A FEW DAYS AGO, DIS IS AN AWESOME PHONE. THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE PHONE FOR ME HAS BEEN GOOD. I AM PLANNING TO UPGRADE IT ANDROID V4.0 BUT DONT KNOW HOW.
      
      HOWEVER, RECENTLY, I HAVE BEEN FACING A BIT OF AN ISSUE WITH THE TOUCH. I DONT KNOW THE REASON BUT AFTER I CHANGED TO THE DEFAULT THEME, IT HAS SLOWLY STRTED WORKING BETTR BT NT VERY SMOOTH. I WAS USING A DIFFRNT THEME FOR QUITE SOMETIME.
      
      ALL IN ALL I WOULD SAY, THIS IS A GOOD PHONE TO BUY WITHIN THE 15K BUDGET N YOU WONT FEEL CHEATED. IT DELIVERS ALL THAT IT PROMISES......"
Xperia U,4,"HI EVERYONE I BOUGHT THIS PHONE TWO DAYS AGO, SUPER UI LIKED THE ICONS ITS MUCH BETTER THAT ANY OTHER COMPANY PHONES IN THE MARKET, NOW COMING TO THE ACTUAL RAM SIZE ITS 389MB WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH TO RUN THE APPS. DUAL CORE PROCESSOR YOU CAN REALLY MAKE OUT THE DIFF B/W THIS PHONE AND THE SINGLE CORE PHONE WHILE PLAYING HIGH END GAMES.DISPLAY IS GOOD ACTUALLY CAN SAY ITS BETTER THAN S DUOS AND MANY MORE. CAMERA IS GOOD BUT NOT UP TO MARK.BATTERY BACKUP IS LOW FOR THIS KIND OF PHONE BUT NOT THAT REALLY BAD FOR MODERATE USAGE. ICE CREAM SANDWICH UPDATE IS AVAILABLE. INTERNAL STORAGE 2GB FOR APPS AND 2GB FOR OTHER DATA.OVERALL THE PHONE FEELS GOOD BOTH BUILD QUALITY,LOOKS AND THE PERFORMANCE.
      
      ITS MUCH BETTER THAT SAMSUNG,HTC,MOTOROLA,NOKIA,ETC... FOR THIS PRICE.
      
      ONE STAR LESS FOR BATTERY AND RAM."
Xperia U,4,"HMM.. THE SET HAS MORE OF PROS THAN CONS.
      
      IT HAS EVERYTHING WHAT U EXPECT FROM UR CELLPHONE LIKE...GOOD CAMERA..ICS UPDATE...SOUND IS JUST AWESOME ONCE U HAVE YOUR EARPHONES CONNECTED..A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR WHICK MAKES WORK FAST ETC.
      
      THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE BATTERY BACKUP.SINCE IT HAS SOME FLASHY LIGHTS ATTACHED TO IT,WHICH TURNS ON EVERY TIME U TOUCH UR CELLPHONE, WHICH IN TURN EATS AWAY THE BATTERY.
      
      BUT I THINK THAT IS NOT A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE U NEED TO RECHARGE ANY SMARTPHONE ONCE A DAY.
      
      IN NUTSHELL, THUMBS UP..!!"
Xperia U,4,"I AM A XPERIA U USER SINCE LAST 2 MONTHS, AND IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY. REGARDING THE DECISION BETWEEN U AND J, PROCESSOR MATTERSAND IF U R INTO GAMING, DONT GO FOR THE J, INSTEAD, YOU CAN LOOK AT THE XPERIA SOLA. IT HAS BETTER HARDWARE THAN J (THOUGH A SLIGHTLY SMALLER SCREEN) AT ALMOST THE SAME PRICE. I HAVENT UPGRADED TO ICS READING ABT THE LAG ISSUES IN XPERIA U AND A BIG PROBLEM THAT I FACE IN U IS THE SCREEN WIDTH...ITS A PAIN TO TYPE IN PORTRAIT MODE. THE PROBLEM GETS SOLVED IF U R USED TO TYPE IN LANDSCAPE THOUGH....OTHER THAN THAT, PERFECT PHONE FOR 15K."
Xperia U,4,"I AM GIVING THIS REVIEW AFTER USEING THE PHONE FOR ABUT 1 MONTHS
      
      
      I BUY THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART ON DECEMBER 5 AND I GET THIS PHONE IN 2 DAYS NICE AND FAST DEIIVERY THE PHONE IS NICE PACKED WHEN I OPEN THE BOX THE PHONE IS LOOKING SO COOL
      
      NOW SCREEN IS SO CLEAR BECAUSE SCREEN HAVING 297 PPI AND IN THIS RANG NO PHONE CAN GIVE THIS MUCH OF THINGS AND 16M COLOUR SCREEN
      
      
      IT IS HAVING BRAVIA ENGINE IN THE PHONE BUT REALIY GUYS IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND THE BRAVIA IS WORKING OR NOT THERE IS A OPTION TO SWITCH OF AND ON THE BRAVIA ENGINE IN DISPLAY SETTING ,SO I CAN SAY WE WILL NOT APLE TO FIND THE DIFFERENCE OF BRAVIA ENGINE BUT SCREEN IS TO GOOD
      
      
      NOW COME TO ON CAMERA IS GOOD AND TAKE V.GOOD PICTURES IN DAY LIGHT AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE THE PHOTOS , BUT IN THE NIGHT CAMERA IS WORST YOU WILL SEE TO MANY BLACK SPOT SO THE PHOTOS ARE  VERY BAD ON LOW LIGHT
      
      COME TO FLASH LIGHT IF YOU ARE THINKING THAT IN NIGHT OR LOW LIGHT FLASH WILL HELP TO CAPTURING THE PHOTOS THEN YOU ARE WRONG FLASH GIVE LIGHT BUT THE PHOTOS ARE POOR
      
      AND DON,T EXPECT THAT THERE IS VERY NICE CAMERA YOU CAN RECORD VIDEOS AT 720P BUT THE RESOLUTION OF CAMERA IS VERY LOW IT HAS ONLY 2566 TO 1966 IS THE HIGEST RESOLUTION OF CAMERA THIS MUCH OF RESOLUTION CAN GET IN NOKIA X2-00 CHEAP 5MP CAMERA PHONE SO DON,T GET HAPPY THAT CAMERA IS HD
      
      
      NOW COME TO RAM FLIPKART TELL THAT PHONE HAS HAVING 512MB RAM BUT WHEN YOU WILL GET THIS PHONE THEN YOU WILL KNOW ABOUT THE RAM IT HAS ONLY 300 MB IS THE HIGHEST YOU WILL NOT ABLE TO FIND WHERE IS 200 MB RAM IS GONE AND ON THOSE 300MB RAM 160 OR 170 IS USED BY PHONE APP IF YOU CLOSE IT IT WILL AGAIN OPEN AND SO IMPORTANT THING THERE IS NO TASK MANAGER IN PHONE SO YOU HAVE TO ALWAYS USE TO STOP THE APP FROM SETTING
      
      
      PROCESSER AND PROCESSING IS VERY NICE YOU WILL NEVER FELL LAG ON PHONE PERFORMANCE
      
      
      AND NOW ON PHONE MEMORY IT IS TO LOW IT HAS ONLY 8GB AND ON THOSE 8GB THERE IS ONLY 4GB IS AVILABLE FOR USER AND 2GB IS FOR YOU INSTALLING THE APP IF FOR ARE A MUSIC,MOVIES AND VIDEOS LOVER THEN DON,T TAKE THIS PHONE IT WILL FINISH VERY SOON BUT IT SUPORT FLASH DERIVE LIKE PEN DRIVE ,MOUSE AND KEY BORD BY OTG CABLE THAT ARE EASY TO FIND IN MARKET SO YOU CAN FORGET MEMORY ISSUSE
      
      
      IT IS HAVING MAIL-400 GRAPHIC WHICH SUPPORT GREAT GAME BUT DUE TO MEMORY PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD AND PLAY THE GAME AFTER PLAYING DELETE THOSE GAME BECAUSE IF YOU SAVE GAME THERE IS NO SPACE FOR MEDIA
      
      
      BY ALL OF THESE WILL RATE THIS PHONE
      
      PERFORMANCE - 5
      
      CAMERA - 4
      
      MEMORY -3
      
      DESINE - 4
      
      GRAPHIC - 5
      
      RAM - 4
      
      AND FOR WHOLE PHONE I WILL GIVE 4 RATING TO THIS PHONE
      
      SO GUYS WHEN YOU BUY THIS PHONE YOU HAVE TO FACE THESE PROBLEM BUT I WILL SAY YOU GO FOR IT BECAUSE IN THIS PRICE RANG NO COMPANY CAN GAVE THIS TYPE OF FEATURES THIS IS ALL"
Xperia U,4,"I AM QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE PHONE'S PERFORMANCE.......CAMERA IRRITATES SMTYMS BUT MAY BE I GUESS IT IS A SOFTWARE ISSUE......LOOKS ARE ALSO DECENT AND HD RESOLUTION MAKES WATCHING VIDEOS EXPERIENCE QUITE AMAZING.....MOREOVER DUE TO OTG SUPPORT WE CAN CONNECT PEN DRIVES,USB MOUSE,KEYBOARD ETC WHICH IS AWSM ....OVERALL A GR8 PHN IN THIS PRICE RANGE....GO FOR IT."
Xperia U,4,"I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER USING THE PHONE FOR A WEEK.
      
      TO START THINGS OFF, LET ME CLEAR THE AIR ABOUT ITS BUILT IN  MEMORY. ITS GOT A TOTAL OF 8GB INTERNAL MEMORY,(NOT EXPANDABLE)  OF WHICH :
      
      2GB IS FOR THE OS;
      
      2GB IS ALLOCATED ONLY FOR APPS(WITH ABOUT 1.5GB FREE).
      
      REMAINING 4GB IS FOR USERS.
      
      I FEEL THIS IS ENOUGH FOR MOST USERS. THOSE WHO WANT TO WATCH LOTS OF MOVIES CAN USE ""USB ON THE GO"". SO THE MISSING SD CARD SLOT IS NOT A BIG PROBLEM.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1.ITS GOT AN AMAZING MUSIC PLAYER(AS WITH MOST SONY DEVICES).
      
      
      2.THE PROCESSOR(DUAL-CORE 1 GHZ CORTEX-A9) HANDLES ANYTHING YOU THROW AT IT. ITS GOT AN ABOVE AVERAGE GPU(MALI-400MP) THAT CAN RUN MOST HD GAMES WITHOUT LAGGING.
      
      
      3.THE BRAVIA ENGINE POWERED DISPLAY IS CRISP, AND COLOURS ARE RICH.
      
      
      4.THE ILLUMINATION BAR IS REALLY COOL. IT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED USING THE ILLUMINATION BAR APP.
      
      THE BACK COVER IS MADE FROM RUBBERIZED PLASTIC WHICH GIVES IT A PREMIUM FEEL.
      
      THE BUTTONS ON THE SIDE WORK WELL AND HAVE GOOD FEEDBACK.
      
      FOR THE COLOUR OBSESSED PEOPLE OUT THERE ,THE BLACK PLASTIC BENEATH THE SEE-THROUGH STRIP CAN BE UNCLIPPED AND REPLACED WITH SOMETHING BRIGHTER.
      
      ALL OF THIS COMES TOGETHER TO GIVE THE SONY XPERIA U A QUALITY, WELL-MADE FEEL, THAT APES THE DESIGN OF THE HIGH-END SONY XPERIA S WELL.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1.ITS CAMERA ISNT THE BEST AROUND. BUT FOR THE PRICE POINT IT SHOOTS GOOD PHOTOS AND AVERAGE VIDEOS.
      
      
      2.IT SHIPS WITH THE OLDER GINGERBREAD OS. EAGERLY WAITING FOR ICS UPDATE WHICH PROMISES BETTER BATTERY LIFE, AND PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      IT IS 12MM THICK. SOME COMPETITORS ARE SLIMMER. BUT IT DOSE'NT FEEL VERY BULKY.
      
      
      IN CONCLUSION,
      
      IT IS THE BEST PHONE IN THE MARKET FOR THE 16000 PRICE POINT. ANY PHONE IN THE MARKET COMES WITH  ITS OWN PROS AND CONS, BUT IN XPERIA U  PROS OUTWEIGH CONS, SO JUST GO AHEAD AND BUY IT."
Xperia U,4,"I BOUGHT MY XPERIA U ABOUT 1 YEAR BACK, AND NEEDLESS TO SAY, I HAD SO MANY PEOPLE TELLING ME TO GO FOR OTHER MODELS LIKE A SAMSUNG GALAXY S, OR A MOTOROLA DEFY. I STARTED GETTING INFLUENCED BY PEOPLES REMARKS ABOUT ITS LOW BATTERY LIFE, AND LACK OF EXTERNAL STORAGE.
      
      
      BUT TO BE HONEST, THE PHONE COMPENSATES FOR ALL THAT IT LACKS.
      
      
      I BOUGHT IT FOR ABOUT RS. 15,000 WHEN IT FIRST CAME. IM IMMENSELY HAPPY WITH THE NIFTY DESIGN, AND HOW SUPER-LIGHT IT IS. THE BACK FEELS GOOD TO HOLD, AND A PHONE WITH A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR UNDER 16K IS QUITE HARD TO FIND, AT LEAST NOT UPTO THE QUALITY OF SONY.
      
      
      THE BUILD IS GREAT, FUNCTIONS ARE SMOOTH, AND HAS A REALLY GREAT DISPLAY, THOUGH SMALLER THAN I WANTED, BUT THATS OK. I LOVE TAKING PHOTOS WHEREVER I GO, AND XPERIA U IS A GREAT DEVICE TO DO SO. SHARP PHOTOS, WITH AUTO-ZOOM, AND A 720P HD VIDEO RECORDER, IT STILL AMAZES ME HOW SONY PUT UP THIS PHONE FOR A LOW PRICE. PLUS, NOT THAT ITS IMPORTANT OR ANYTHING, THE LITTLE COLOUR-CHANGING TRANSPARENT STRIP AT THE BOTTOM, IS A UNIQUE AND EXCITING FINISH TO WHAT IS A GREAT PHONE.
      
      
      AFTER ONE YEAR, IM STILL CONTENT WITH MY XPERIA U. IVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH IT SO FAR, AND AM COMPLETELY HAPPY WITH IT.
      
      
      I HAVE TO ADMIT, I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LACK OF SPACE, AS I USE MY PHONE LARGELY FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC, AND AM LIMITED TO THE NUMBER OF SONGS I HAVE. AND THE BATTERY LIFE COULD DEFINITELY BE BETTER.
      
      
      BUT OVERALL, XPERIA U IS A GREAT PHONE FOR PEOPLE HAVING A LOW BUDGET IN MIND, AND STILL WANTING THE QUALITY OF A SONY PRODUCT.
      
      
      IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PHONE AROUND 10-15K, BY ALL MEANS, XPERIA U IS A GREAT PHONE.
      
      DONT LET SOME MINOR DEFECTS PUT YOU OFF (OR OTHER PEOPLES NEGATIVE COMMENTS)!"
Xperia U,4,"I BOUGHT THIS CELL 15 DAYS AGO AND I,M LOVING IT..
      
      DON'T STUCK TO MEMORY ISSUE IT SUPPORTS ON-THE-GO USB.
      
      PROS
      
      1. CAMERA CLARITY IS BEST
      
      2. FANTASTIC TOUCH RESPONSE COMPARED TO SAMSUMG
      
      3. BEST SOUND QUALITY
      
      4. SCREEN RESOLUTION IS AWESOME
      
      5. SUPPORTS MOST OF THE VIDEO FORMATS
      
      6. CATCHES SIGNAL IN AREA WHERE SAMSUNG CAN NOT.
      
      
      CONS
      
      1. POOR BATTERY BACK UP IF U R FREQUENT NET USER LIKE ME
      
      2. U CAN VIDEO CHAT BT CAN'T MAKE VIDEO CALL
      
      
      MY SUGGESTION GO FOR IT..."
Xperia U,4,"I BOUGHT THIS MOBILE 3 MONTHS BACK AND USED THE DEFAULT 2.3.7 VERSION TILL LAST WEEK, AND NOW UPGRADED IT TO 4.0.4. I HAVEN'T FACED ANY MAJOR ISSUES NEITHER IN THE PREVIOUS OR CURRENT OS. WIFI USED TO DISCONNECT AFTER SOME TIME IN 2.3.7 BUT IN ICS EVEN THAT IS RESOLVED.CAMERA IS OK, GREAT FOR GAMING. IF YOU ARE NOT A STORAGE FREAK THIS IS ONE AMONG THE BEST MOBILE TO BUY"
Xperia U,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN OCT 2012 AND FIRST I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED, THE STORAGE IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME BUT AFTER SOMETIME I NOTICED THAT THE SPEAKERS MAKE A CRACKLING SOUND WHILE PLAYING MUSIC AND THE VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE ALSO COME IN MEDIUM QUALITY. OTHER THAN THIS EVERYTHING'S FINE AND THE PERFORMANCE AND COMPATIBILITY OF GAMES IS GOOD. IT SCORES ABOVE THE GALAXY TAB 10.1 IN QUADRANT STANDARD. IT SCORES ABOUT 2700 IN IT. THE CAMERA IS GOOD AND I REALLY LIKE THE 3D SWEEP PANAROMA IN IT."
Xperia U,4,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE JUST BECAUSE IT HAS AN AMAZING LARGE DISPLAY, AND HAS A GREAT DEAL OF FEATURES TOO.
      
      
      FIRST THINGS FIRST, ITS NOT AS GOOD AS AN AMOLED SCREEN, BUT CONTRASTS ARE PRETTY DEEP, SO YOU ARE LIKELY TO ENJOY YOUR GAMES AND MOVIES.
      
      
      COMING INTO THE APPS,
      
      
      THE APPS RUN GREAT ON THIS PHONE, ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE LARGE SCREEN, YOU HAVE MORE VIEW AREA
      
      
      COMING INTO THE GAMES,
      
      
      WITH A LARGER SCREEN AGAIN, GAMES BECOME ENJOYABLE TO PLAY ON THIS PHONE LIKE NOTHING!
      
      
      APART FROM THE ABOVE TWO IMPORTANT THINGS, I FOUND VARIOUS OTHER PROS THAT MAKES THIS PHONE A GEM! AMAZING 5MP CAMERA, BUILT IN AUDIO PLAYER IS ALSO GREAT
      
      
      IN SHORT, THE PHONE IS AWESOME! GO FOR IT!!!"
Xperia U,4,"I BROUGHT IT SONY RETAILER...I AM VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE...DUAL CORE,COOL LED STUFF ETC..ALL APPS RUN SMOOTHLY ..ALSO ICS UPDATE IS JUST AROUND...ONLY PROBLEM I AM FACING IS DAMM 8GB MEMORY WITH ONLY 4GB USER ACCESSIBLE...FRANKLY 8GB IS TOO LOW...SONY SHOULD HAVE ATLEAST PROVIDED 16GB...
      
      REGARDING ABOVER QUERY REGARDING CAMERA QUALITY...THERE IS A SMALL PLASTIC COVER PROTECTING THE CAMERA..JUST REMOVE IT...PICTURE QUALITY IS FINE...."
Xperia U,4,"I BUY THIS PHONE NOT FROM FLIPKART.
      
      THIS PHONE IS GOOD BUT ITS USER MEMORY(4GB)NOT ENOUGH AND ALSO IT HAS  SIGNAL PROBLEM.
      
      CAMERO QUALITY NOT BAD BUT SOUND LOUDNESS VERY POOR.
      
      SONY BATTARY NOT GOOD. FULL CHARGE IT RUN A GAME ONLY TWO HOURS."
Xperia U,4,"I DIDN'T BUY THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART DUE TO IMPATIENCE AND LITTLE PARANOIA, ANYWAY LET ME COME TO THE MAIN POINTS.
      
      I BOUGHT A WHITE ONE JUST TO BE OUT OF THE ORDINARY, THOUGH I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WHITE GETS DIRTY IF NOT TAKEN CARE OF (MY PHONE'S SHELL GETS SOME BLUE SPOTS BECAUSE I USE BALL PENS FOR WRITING :D)
      
      PROS:
      
      1) HIGH PPI SCREEN - TEXT IS SHARPER
      
      2) FANCY ILLUMINATION BAR
      
      3) RUBBERISED FEELON THE BACK - GOOD GRIP
      
      4) REMOVABLE BATTERY
      
      5) UPGRADABLE TO ICS, MAY GET JELLYBEAN UPDATE IN FUTURE
      
      6) MINIMAL LAG (I HAVE INSTALLED A LOT OF APPS)
      
      7) NICE PINCHING OUT THE HOME SCREEN, SEE ALL THE WIDGETS AT ONCE
      
      8) NO OTHER PHONES OFFER SUCH FEATURES AT THE PRICE (AMONG PREMIUM COMPANIES E.G. SAMSUNG, SONY, HTC, LG ATC. EXCLUDING HUAWEI, MICROMAX, KARBONN ETC.)
      
      9) THE PHONE HAS TWO MICS FOR BACKGROUND NOISE REDUCTION
      
      10) CAMERA FLASH HAS GOOD BRIGHTNESS
      
      11) XPERIA KEYBOARD'S GESTURE (SWYPE) INPUT IS NICE, NO NEED FOR THIRD PARTY APPS
      
      12) LIGHWEIGHT AND EASY TO CARRY AROUND
      
      13) YOU GET A SCREEN GUARD IN BOX.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) BATTERY BACKUP NOT UP THE MARK, ONLY 1290 MAH BATTERY, A DAY AT THE MOST ON MODERATE USAGE AND LOW BRIGHTNESS, 3G CONSUMES BATTERY VERY FAST
      
      2) 512 MB RAM ADVERTISED, ONLY 368 MB IS USER AVAILABLE.
      
      3) LOT OF BACKGROUND APPS WILL MAKE PHONE SLOW'
      
      4) THIS IS THE BIGGEST CON ACCORDING TO ME: NO VIDEO CALLING OVER 3G (I.E. WITHOUT MOBILE DATA) ! YOU NEED A DATA PLAN TO VIDEO CALL OVER HSPA OR WI-FI, THAT TOO USING A THIRD PARTY APP SUCH AS SKYPE :(
      
      5) GETS HEATED UP ON CONTINUOUS WEB BROWSING, FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO, ESPECIALLY OVER HSPA.
      
      
      NEUTRAL:
      
      1) 8 GB INTERNAL STORAGE WITHOUT SD CARD SLOT(2GB RESERVED FOR APPS, 4GB USER STORAGE, REST ROM) - SOME PEOPLE FIND IT LIMITING, IT IS OKAY FOR ME [ATLEAST TILL I RUN OUT OF SPACE, WHICH ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON :) ]
      
      2) GETS ANDROID 2.3.7 GINGERBREAD OUT OF THE BOX, HAS TO UPGRADED TO ICS, WHICH SADLY IS NOT OVER-THE-AIR"
Xperia U,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING SONY XPERIA U SINCE LAST 1 MONTH ... EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD SO FAR... AMAZING SERVICE BY FLIPKART. RECEIVED WITHIN 2 DAYS OF PLACING THE ORDER. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE POINTS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT.
      
      PROS:
      
      1) DIFFERENT AND AMAZING UI BY SONY
      
      2) THE TOUCH AND FEEL OF THE PHONE IS GREAT
      
      3) AMAZING DISPLAY WITH VIBRANT COLORS AND GOOD VISIBILITY EVEN IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. BRAVIA ENGINE A BIG PLUS
      
      4) THE 6 GB STORAGE IS NOT AN ISSUE AS ITS SUFFICIENT FOR MOST USERS AND DUE TO INBUILT MEMORY CARD THE PHONE IS SUPER FAST WHILE ACCESSING AND LOADING CONTENTS FROM MEMORY CARD
      
      5) THE MALI 400 GPU CAN PLAY ALL GAMES WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE.
      
      6) THE TRANSPARENT STRIP IS AN EYE CATCHER. ALSO THE SMALL INDICATORS ON TOP ARE VERY HELPFUL.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) BATTERY IS A BIT WEAK ESPECIALLY IF USING 3G NETWORK(ALTHOUGHT THE EXTENDED STANDBY MODE IS VERY HELPFUL)
      
      2) CAMERA IS JUST OK NOT AMAZING ESPECIALLY DURING NIGHT TIME"
Xperia U,4,"I HAVE GOT THIS MOBILE DELIVERED THROUGH FLIPKART JUST TODAY.. I WAS SO EXCITED TO EXPLORE THIS NEW PRETTY BABY. I HAVE STARTED USING ANDROID FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO, EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT TO ME. INFACT, I WAS NOT EXPECTING ANY MIRACLES WITH THIS BUDGET PHONE BUT, COMING TO THE BASIC FEATURES OF A MOBILE PHONE LIKE MUSIC AND CAMERA... I GOT DISPPOINTED BIG TIME WITH ITS MUSIC QUALITY. ITS DAMN FLAT EVEN WITH FULL VOLUME.. TRIED ALL POSSIBLE OPTIONS TO THAT WONDERFUL QUALITY SONY USED TO GIVE.. BUT, NO LUCK. EVEN LOUD SPEAKER IS VERY VERY POOR THAT YOU CAN HEAR THE RING VOLUME FROM 3 METERS DISTANCE."
Xperia U,4,"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PHONE FEW DAYS BACK...THIS PHONE HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM OF NO SERVICE..NETWORK DROPPPING...SONY HAS ASSURED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY AUGUST...SO IF U CAN WAIT TILL THIS PROBLEM GET RESOLVED THATS FINE...U CN DOWNLOAD A SOFTWARE ""MCSTEALTH SIGNAL BOOSTER"" TO MINIMIZE THIS PROBLEM... LOOK WISE PHONE IS VERY GOOD..SOUND IS LITTLE BIT LOW...DURING CALL AS WELL AS RINGING... OVERALL A GOOD PHONE BUT THINK BEFORE PURCHASE..."

THE SOUND OF THE SPEAKER IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING THOUGH MY QUESTION IS, IS IT THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY? I HAD EXPECTED BOOMBASTIC SOUND FROM SONY SPEAKERS AND THE XLOUD THING DOESN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BUT THE EARPHONES WITH THE BOX ARE THE BEST THING.. THE CLARITY IS EXEMPLARY AND THE BEST WAY TO LISTEN TO MUSIC IS PUTTING THEM ON AND GROOVING WITH IT. :D

Xperia U,4,"NO DOUGHT THAT THIS PHONE IS BEST AT 16K.
      
      BUT MOTOROLA ATRIX 2 IS TOO GOOD WITH ONLY RS.3000 MORE.
      
      ATRIX 2 HAS SAME 1GZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR.

      UPGRADED TO ICS V4.0.4
      
      
      JUST LOOK HOW MUCH MORE U GET IN 3K MORE AMOUNT"
Xperia U,4,"NO.
      
      APPS LIKE SCREEN FILTER ETC. JUST DISABLE THE LED'S DURING SOFT KEY TOUCHES.I WAS ALSO APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THIS FACT.BUT I KINDA LIKE THEM NOW :D"
Xperia U,4,"NOW THERE?S 50GB OF FREE STORAGE FOR YOUR MUSIC, VIDEOS, PHOTOS AND MORE ? AND YOU CAN USE IT FOREVER. TOGETHER WITH BOX? SONY IS OFFERING YOU A PLACE FOR YOUR STUFF WHERE YOU CAN GET TO EVERYTHING FROM YOUR ANDROID SMARTPHONE, COMPUTER OR TABLET.

Xperia U,4,PLEASE REPLY HERE ASAP.. SINCE I AM GOING TO BUY THIS CELL THIS MONTH END. I FOUND THIS CELL PHONE EXTREMELY SEXY.. WITH FEATURES AWA WITH LOOKS.. I AM EAGER TO BUY THIS CELL SINCE IT IS ICS UPGRADABLE PHONE....
Xperia U,4,"SAHI PHONE HAI, USE KARKE MAZA AA GAYA!
      
      
      THE ONLY PROBLEM IS SLIGHTLY LOW BATTERY LIFE, YOU'LL NEED TO CHARGE IT EVERY EVENING IF YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC, USE THE INTERNET, GPS ETC. OTHERWISE IT'S VERY REASONABLE AND RELIABLE AND A LOT OF FUN TO USE!"
Xperia U,4,"SONY IS FED UP OF ALL THE BAD HYPE AND CRITICISM ON THE STORAGE CAPACITY OF DIS PHONE!!!...SO,50 GB OF CLOUD SPACE ABSOLUTELY FREE WITH THIS PHONE!!....NOW TATS A GR8 PHONE TO BUY...GO FOR IT...ITS ABSOLUTELY FAST AND IF YOU START USING A SONY PRODUCT YOU WILL NEVER CHOOSE TO BUY ANY OTHER COMPANIES PHONE!!!...SONY IS AMAZING!!"
Xperia U,4,"SORRY FLIPKART, BUT I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AT 13500 FROM LOCAL SHOP IN PUNE.
      
      
      ABOUT PHONE:
      
      PHONE IS GREAT CONSIDERING ITS PRICE.
      
      IT HAS BRILLIANT DISPLAY.
      
      SOLID BUILT QUALITY.
      
      NICE UI
      
      LOOKS GREAT (AT LEAST IN WHITE COLOR WHICH I HAVE)
      
      TOUCH IS ALSO SMOOTH.
      
      
      EXCEPT MEMORY IS AN ISSUE WITH YOU THE PHONE IS BEST BUY IN PRICE BRACKET OF 10K-15K.
      
      BELIEVE ME THERE ARE NOT COMPARABLE PHONE IN THE MARKET.
      
      PHONES BETTER THAN THIS STARTS ABOVE 16-16.5K.
      
      
      GO AHEAD AND BUY IT IF BUDGET IS RESTRICTING YOU."
Xperia U,4,THE 1GHZ PROCESSOR WORKS WONDERFULLY. THE OTG(ON THE GO) THING IS GREAT. I CAN ATTACH PENDRIVE AND WATCH MOVIES AND SONGS. SO INTERNAL MEMORY IS NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL. PLUS THE LOOKS OF THE CELL ARE AWESOME.
Xperia U,4,"THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THING. YOU WONT GET A COMPARISON PHONE TO THIS AWESOME HARDWARE AND UI IN THIS PRICE RANGE. YESTERDAY I GOT MY XPERIA U.
      
      
      THE OPTIONAL PHONES WERE:
      
      NOKIA LUMIA 710: HARDWARE IS GOOD, BUT CANT UPGRADE FROM MANGO 7.5
      
      
      HTC DESIRE V: AWESOME DESIGN AND HARDWARE. ALTOGETHER A VERY NICE PHONE BUT,UM I BECAME LITTLE BRAND CONSCIOUS.
      
      
      SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS: AN ALL IN ONE PHONE. STANDBY DUAL SIM AND EXPANDABLE MEMORY, BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE DESIGN &AMP; UI SINCE I OWN A GALAXY Y.
      
      
      XPERIA U: ONLY DRAWBACK IS NO EXPANDABLE MEM SLOT BUT I CAN ADJUST WITH THAT WITH OTG. BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS SUCH AS DUAL CORE PROCESSOR CORTEX A9, NOVATHOR CHIPSET  WHICH COMES WITH 20K ABOVE PHONE IN OTHER BRANDS, GRAPHICS, BANDWIDTH(14.4 HSDPA)  MADE ME FELL IN LOVE WITH 'U'.  CHOOSE WISELY."
Xperia U,4,"THE ONLY AND THE BIGGEST ISSUE WITH THE MOB IS THE MEMORY , THOUGH THEY HAVE TOLD THAT IT IS 8GB BUT ONLY 4GB IS USABLE AND SECOND MOST PROBLEM COMES WITH THE BATTERY PACKUP IT GIVES VERY LESS BACKUP , EXCLUDING THESE TWO THE MOBILE IS FAR GOOD MOB AT THIS RANGE OF 15K"
Xperia U,4,"THE ONLY REASON LOOSING THE LAST STAR IS BECAUSE OF MEMORY CONSTRAINT!
      
      
      GUYS I'M USING IT FROM ALMOST 4 MONTHS &AMP; I'M VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PHONE FROM SONY .... FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MAIN HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS PHONE
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. DISPLAY : 3.5 INCH IS I GUESS JUST ENOUGH FOR MOST OF THE PEOPLE. PIXEL QUALITY IS DENSE &AMP; CRISP
      
      2. PERFORMANCE : DUAL-CORE @ THIS PRICE RANGE IS RARE TO FIND. I'VE ENCOUNTERED VERY LESS NO. OF OR RARELY ANY LAGS, FREEZES WHEN PLAYING COMPARATIVELY HEAVY-GRAPHICS GAMES LIKE BLOOD &AMP; GLORY
      
      3. CAMERA : PICTURE QUALITY OF IMAGES IS JUST ABOVE AVERAGE, BUT 720P VIDEO QUALITY IS VERY GOOD... PROVIDED YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL/ SLOW WHILE PANNING ... OTHERWISE YOU'LL HAVE TO SUFFER SOME WOBBLES
      
      4. SPEED : DUAL-CORE REAL IS A PERFORMER WHEN IT COMES TO MULTI-TASKING &AMP; GAMING
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. MEMORY : I WONT SAY ITS A REAL DEAL-BREAKER. 6 GIGS IS STILL FARE AMOUNT OF STORAGE. BUT IF YOU'RE A GADGET-GEEK &AMP; LIKE SPEND 4-5 HRS A DAY ... PLOWING FINGERS THRO PHONE, THEN THIS MEM-CONSTRAINT MAY END-UP IN FRUSTRATION
      
      2. BATTERY : WELL I GUESS WITH DUAL-CORE &AMP; A BRIGHTER, CRISP DISPLAY, YOU'LL HAVE TO COMPROMISE WITH BATTERY. AS THESE 2 ARE A REAL BATTERY-EATING MONSTERS &AMP; SOMEWHERE SONY HAS FAILED IN THIS, AS WITH REGULAR USAGE... 1-2 HRS MUSIC, 0.5-1 HR OF GAMING .. BROWSING &AMP; TALKING FOR A COUPLE OF HRS...  &AMP; THE BATTERY WILL LAST FOR 1 DAY MAX OR EVEN LESS IF YOU'RE ON 3G
      
      
      SO ITS YOUR CALL! BUT IN OVER-ALL THE PHONE IS SIMPLY A PERFORMER &AMP; WON'T LET YOU DOWN! ITS A GOOD BUY @ THIS PRICE."
Xperia U,4,"THE PHONE IS A GREAT CATCH FOR THE PRICE :
      
      PROS:
      
      1.SMOOTH PERFORMANCE ON GINGER BREAD
      
      2.GREAT SCREEN
      
      3.GOOD CAMERA
      
      4.GREAT LOOKS
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1.THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK IS THAT AFTER ICS UPDATE THE PHONE FREEZES AND LAGS A LOT
      
      MAY BE THE MERE 512 MB RAM IS TOO LESS HANDLE ICS.
      
      2.SO IF YOU BUY THIS PHONE USE IT WITH GINGERBREAD ONLY DON'T UPDATE TO ICS."
Xperia U,4,"THE PHONE IS GREAT WITH ALL FEATURES SUCH AS AUTO SYNC ETC WHICH HELPS YOU TO AUTO-SYNC ALL YOUR CONTACTS INTEGRATING WITH YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT, THEN YOU HAVE THE AWESOME 5 MP CAMERA WITH THE BRAVIA ENGINE THAT ROCKS THE PICTURE QUALITY TO MAXIMUM AND YOU CAN GET PICTURES THAT LOOK MORE BEAUTIFUL ON YOUR XPERIA U. THEN YOU HAVE THE 1GHZ PROCESSOR WHICH IS PRETTY SMOOTH EVEN WHEN YOUR CELL IS ON USE ( I MEAN WHEN MOST OF YOUR APPS ARE ON ) BEING A DUAL CORE PROSSESOR  THE CELL IS SMOOTH TO HANDLE AND FOR GAMING ITS ONE OF ITS KIND, THE TOUCH RESPONSE IS GREAT. NOW THE ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE SOUND. THE SOUND WHICH IS FROM XLOUD IS NOT AT ALL LOUD ENOUGH AND CRACKS SOMETIMES WHEN ON FULL VOLUME. WELL THE PHONE LOOKS SUPER SEXY AND IS A GREAT ASSET TO OWN ONE. THE CAMERAS ARE SIMPLY GREAT AND YOU ALSO GOT THE SECONDARY CAMERA WHOSE CLARITY TOO IS GREAT. SO OVERALL KEEPING THE PHONES SPEAKERS ASIDE THE PHONE IS A GREAT ASSET TO OWN SO I WOULD SAY IF YOUR MORE INTERESTED IN CAPTURING PHOTOS THEN XPERIA U IS A GREAT PHONE FOR IT.
      
      CURRENTLY LOVING MY XPERIA U!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE DELIVERY TIMING WAS ALSO GREAT HERE IN GOA TOO THANKS FLIPKART FOR THE FAST SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Xperia U,4,"THEY SAY LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT IS NOT A MYTH! I AGREE.. I FELL IN LOVE WITH A SONY XPERIA U, THE FIRST TIME I SAW ITS AD ON TV. LATER AFTER THOROUGH ONLINE RESEARCH I FINALLY DECIDED TO BUY ONE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS BEYOND MY BUDGET. HERE I MUST EVEN SAY, THAT I HAD ACTUALLY BOOKED A WRONG COLOR CHOICE WHICH WAS RECTIFIED BY FLIPKART WITHIN FEW MINUTES. REALLY IMPRESSED. ALSO PACKAGING AND DELIVERY WAS VERY GOOD.
      
      
      SONY XPERIA U IS A DREAM FOR ONE WHO LOOKS FOR CLARITY, FINISH, QUALITY IN A PHONE. I LIKE THE DISPLAY WHICH IS CRYSTAL CLEAR, SOUND QUALITY EVEN THOUGH SLIGHTLY LOW , OUTDOOR CAMERA SHOTS,  UI, THEMES.. I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN WHICH WAS CHANGED BY AN AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER WITHIN 10 MINUTES. IMPRESSIVE, RIGHT! I HAVE UPGRADED IT TO ICS FROM GINGERBREAD.
      
      
      FEW THINGS WHICH YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF:
      
      1. SOMETIMES MY PHONE SAYS IT IS SWITCHED OFF  EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE IN GOOD NETWORK AREA AND NETWORK BAR IS SHOWING GOOD CONNECTIVITY.
      
      2. SOMETIMES I NEED TO RE START YOU PHONE AS I CANNOT CONNECT A LINE WHILE DIALING A NUMBER.
      
      3. BATTERY LEVELS ARE VERY LOW. MAX : 10 -12 HOURS OF CONTINUOUS USAGE.
      
      4. INDOOR LOW LIGHT CAMERA SHOTS ARE BAD.
      
      5. AFTER UPGRADING TO ICS, I HAVE SEEN A FEW PROBLEMS. I NEED TO HAVE IT SHOWN TO MY SERVICE CENTRE GUYS.
      
      
      ANYWAYS, OTHER THAN THIS, THIS IS ONE CHOICE YOU WILL NEVER REGRET. FOR THIS PRICE, I SAY GO FOR IT.."
Xperia U,4,"THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID SO I AM PERHAPS MORE HAPPY BECAUSE OF GOOGLE THAN OF SONY :P. BEFORE BUYING I ALWAYS WANTED A SAMSUNG PHONE BECAUSE OF THEIR PRICES BUT NOTHING GOOD WAS THERE IN A 15K BUDGET. THE ACE-PLUS IS CRAP COMPARED TO THIS.
      
      1. GREAT UI - MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN SAMSUNG UI
      
      2. LIGHTER THAN ALMOST ALL OTHER PHONES IN THIS RANGE!! I LIKE THIS VERY MUCH BUT SOME MAY NOT.
      
      3. LOOKS - WELL YOU CAN ALREADY SEE IT GOOGLE IT
      
      4. PERFORMANCE - NOT A SINGLE HANG/BUG TILL DATE ON HEAVY APPS AND MULTITASKING. STARTUP TIME IS A BIT LONG BUT AFTER THE MAIN SCREEN APPEARS ALL INBOX,CALL LOG ARE LOADED INSTANTLY.
      
      5. SCREEN SIZE WELL A ISSUE FOR MANY. 3.5"" IS BECOMING SMALL BY TODAY'S STANDARDS. BUT THIS HAS A PERFECT 16:9 ASPECT RATIO. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD IS WHILE PLAYING MAXPAYNE I CAN NOT AIM PROPERLY!
      
      6. THE BRAVIA ENGINE WORKS LIKE MAGIC VIDEOS ARE SUPER AWESOME EVEN BETTER THAN MY DESKTOP LED.
      
      7. NETWORK ISSUE - UPGRADE TO ICS 4.0 AND NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT BUT IF YOU ARE ON 2.3 THEN STAY AWAY FROM THE AUTO-POWER SAVING OPTION. EVERYTHING ELSE IS FINE.
      
      8.GREAT BROWSER AND INBUILT VIDEO PLAYER.
      
      9. WELL FOR THE LIMITED MEMORY I HAVE 1.7GB MAX PAYNE AND 2.3GB FULL SEASON 4 OF BREAKING BAD AND ALSO SOME SONGS AND VIDEOS WITH SMALL APPS LIKE WHERE'S MY WATER,ANGRY BIRDS SPACE, TEMPLE RUN. I STILL HAVE 1.8GB FREE SPACE. I(ALSO MANY PEOPLE) DONT NEED THAT EXTRA SD SLOT."
Xperia U,4,"TOO POOR BATTERY BACKUP:-(. REMAINING THINGS ARE SUPERB; NO COMMENTS AT ALL....
      
      
      
      SUPERB DISPLAY... SUPER PROCESSING SPEED... EVERYTHING SUPER EXCEPT BATTERY"
Xperia U,4,"U IS A GREAT PHONE IF U CAN DEAL WITH LITTLE MEMORY, YUP I SAID LITTLE MEMORY BCOZ IN MY SENSE 6 GB MEMORY IS NOT ENOUGH AS ANDROID OS IS UPGRADING DAY BY DAY SPECIALLY IN FIELD OF APP COZ SOMETIME SIZE OF CERTAIN GAME CAN GO UPTO 1 GB OR MORE.
      
      AND SECONDLY BATTERY BACKUP AS 1350 MAH IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS POWER HOUSE LOADED WITH DUAL CORE 1 GHZ PROCESSOR AND MALI-400 MP GPU....
      
      
      AND MOST IMP DONT UPGRADE TO ICS COZ IT WILL DRANE UR BATTERY LYK WATER FALL... ALSO ITS NOT STABLE AS COMPARED TO GB, SO STICK WITH GB
      
      
      SEE YOU SOON GUYS"
Xperia U,4,"USING SINCE LAST 15 DAYS ITS GREAT PHONE HAVING EXCELLENT FEATURES
      
      LIKE GREAT DISPLY, GREAT SPEED, GREAT DESIGN CAMERA WAS ALSO GOOD. BUT I THINK VIDEO CALLING FEATURE IS NOT THERE? CAN ANY ONE KNOWS REGARDING THIS FEATURE? FRONT CAMERA IS THERE BUT VIDEO CALLING OPTION IS NOT THERE."
Xperia U,4,"USING THE CELL FOR SIX MONTHS..CAMERA,DISPLAY,PERFORMANCE,GAMING,SOUND.. EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.. 4GB INTERNAL MEMORY IS A PROBLEM, BUT THE OPTION OF USB ON THE GO SOLVES IT..
      
      NOW THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING OF UPGRADING TO ICS (OR JB VIA FLASHTOOL)..TRUST ME GUYS, ICS OR JB WILL KILL THIS PHONE.. I UPGRADED TO ICS AND FACED TOOO MANY PROBLEMS..
      
      THE PHONE WILL LAG, SLOW DOWN.. (512 MB RAM)
      
      CAMERA WILL TAKE 10 SECONDS TO TAKE A PHOTO..
      
      SPECIALLY AT NIGHT AND DARK AREAS YOUR CAMERA WILL ALMOST STOP WORKING IN ICS,,
      
      THE NOTIFICATION SOUND DOESN'T RING AFTER ONE HOURS OF RESTART.SO YOU'LL HAVE TO KEEP RESTARTING THE PHONE SO THAT YOU CAN BE NOTIFIED IF A TEXT MESSAGE OR MAIL COMES. .(THIS BROUGHT A LOT OF FIGHT BETWEEN ME AND MY GF :) )
      
      
      AND THE LOCK SCREEN IS GONNA GIVE YOU A LOT OF FRUSTRATION.
      
      GAMING IS ALSO AFFECTED DUE TO LOW MEMORY..
      
      IT WILL KEEP SHOWING ONLY 80-70 MB FREE RAM.. SO FORGET MULTITASKING.
      
      
      SO KEEP USING IT IN GB.. WORKS GREAT."
Xperia U,4,"WELL I SEARCHED A LOT OF CELL PHONES WITH SAME SPECS AND I FOUND A VERY FEW IN THIS PRICE RANGE, AMONG ALL THIS WAS THE PERFECT ONE FOR ME, I JUST DISLIKE ONE THING THAT IT HAS NO EXAPANDABLE MEMORY BUT YEAH WE HAVE LAPTOPS AND PC'S TO SAVE HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA AND I JUST LIKE TO KEEP SOME SELECTED SONGS CLICK PICS WITH NICE CLARITY AND KILLING TIME WHILE GAMING... IF U ARE THINKING TO BUY THIS THEN GO FOR IT I ASSURE, U WON'T REGRET, BEST OF LUCK.. :)"
Xperia U,4,"WELL TO BEGIN WITH ...THE STREAM OF THE LIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF PHONE IS AWESOME ...CHANGING WITH THE BACKGROUND. ADDS TO THE BEAUTY OF IT. ..NEXT THE CAMERA ...REALLY GOOD 5 MP DAY /NIGHT ..DOESNT MATTER,,HAVENT USED SECOND CAMERA MUCH BUT ENOUGH FOR SKYPE/VIDEO CHAT....TOUCH SENSATION IS AWESOME..I BOUGHT IT FOR 15K(BEEN 4 -5 MONTHS NOW) ...I SEE NOW ITS 13.9 K...NOW PROBLEMS : ONE IN PARTICULAR WHEN A CALL COMES IN BETWEEN SONGS PLAYING,,,AFTER THE CALL ENDS..THE PLAYER STOPS PLAYING (NO SOUND) ... :(...HAVE TO RESTART THE PHONE... NEXT QUITE UNIQUE PROBLEM ..WHILE PLAYING TEMPLE RUN2 (U CAN PLAY THE GAME ).. SOMETIMES THE GAME HANGS. WHEN U SEE THE HOME ...THE ICONS GETS REVERTED (THING AS IF SUM ONE INSIDE THE PHN WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT PROPERLY)
      
      
      SUMMARY :
      
      1.BATTERY :24 HRS (WITH 2G),10-12 HRS (PLAY LOTS OF VIDEOS)
      
      2.LOOKS :SMART (EDGES CUD HAVE BEEN ROUNDED )
      
      3.CAMERA:GOOD
      
      4.DISPLAY :GREAT
      
      5.MEMORY : :( ...NOT ENOUGH
      
      
      ONE CAN GO FOR IT..GOT THE PERFECT CONFIGURATION IN THIS PRICE RANGE (PROCESSOR ,RAM,FRONT+REAR CAMERA),EXCEPT THE MEMORY FOR 4GB (NOT ENOUGH) AND THE HANGING PROBLEM ,,,,WILLL BE FROM BEGINNING ONLY ...SO USE THE WARANTY."
Xperia U,4,"WHAT IS GOOD:
      
      1. DISPLAY AND PICTURE QUALITY.
      
      2. FAST AS IT IS DUAL CORE.
      
      3. NICE CAMERA.
      
      4. 50 GB OF BOX SPACE
      
      5. GOOD INTERNET BROWSING EXPERIENCE
      
      WHAT IS BAD:
      
      1. FRONT CAMERA DOESN'T WORKS IN SKYPE (WORKS FINE IN GTALK)
      
      2. NO 3G VIDEO CALLING FEATURE AVAILABLE.
      
      3. BECOMES SLOW FOR A FEW MINUTES WHEN YOU EXIT FROM ANY HIGH GRAPHIC GAME LIKE GTA, MODERN COMBAT 3, TEKKEN ETC.
      
      4. FOLDER PLAY OPTION NOT AVAILABE IN DEFAULT MUSIC PLAYER. (YOU CAN DOWNLOAD PLAYERS FROM MARKET, BUT IT WON'T GIVE YOU SAME MUSIC QUALITY AS ITS DEFAULT PLAYER WILL.)"
Xperia U,3,"@NISARG..SAME PROBLM TO ME..TOTALY CNFUSED AMONG U N J..!!
      
      
      EVERYONE KNWS THE SPECS..N THE PRICE..XPERIA U WITH GB WAS LOT BETTR DAN XPERIA J, WHICH WAS PARTIAL THEN TO CHOOSE TO BE WINNR BT NW ITS A TOTAL DIFFRNT CMPETITION..
      
  "
Xperia U,3,"A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS AFTER UPGARDING TO ICS, SO IT WILL BE HELPFUL IF MORE PEOPLE SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE REGARDING THIS AND TIPS ON WHAT TO DO AFTER UPGRADING.
      
      
      OR IS IT BETTER TO CONTINUE WITH ANDROID 2.3 GINGER BREAD ONLY, TO AVOID NEW HEADACHES?"
Xperia U,3,"AFTER HAVING USED THIS MOBILE FOR 6 MONTHS, I CAN SAY THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN UPTO MY EXPECTATIONS..
      
      FIRST OF ALL I BOUGHT IT FOR 15K BUT NOW ITS AVAILABLE FOR ONLY 12K..
      
      THE PLUS POINTS ARE
      
      1) GREAT LOOK(ESPECIALLY THE ILLUMINATION BAR)
      
      2)5 MP CAMERA WITH AUTO FOCUS AND TOUCH FOCUS.
      
      3) SUPPORTS PENDRIVE OTG(PENDRIVE ON THE GO)
      
      
      MINUS POINTS ARE
      
      1)ITS NOT GETTING THE OFFICIAL JELLY BEAN UPDATE AS OF NOW
      
      2)THE ICS UPDATE MAKES IT VERY SLOW AND LAGGY(AFTER THE UPDATE, INITIALLY IT WAS ALRIGHT BUT WITH TIME IT TURNED TOO SLOW. EVEN IF YOU TRY TO MAKE A CALL IT TAKES ABOUT 10-15 SECONDS AND IT BECOMES IRRITATING AT TIMES. ALSO WHEN YOU ARE USING WIFI , ITS MULTITASKING CAPABILITY REDUCES VERY MUCH AND IT HANGS UP MOST TIMES AND SOMETIMES IT EVEN RESTARTS.
      
      3) THE MUSIC QUALITY IN CASE OF LOUDSPEAKER IS NOT UPTO THE MARK.
      
      ALSO THE HEADPHONES YOU GET WITH THIS PHONE ARE CHEAP ONES.
      
      4) NO SUPPORT FOR EXTERNAL SD CARD..
      
      5) FREE RAM IS VERY LOW (ABOUT 50 MB FREE)"
Xperia U,3,"AFTER SPENDING 17000 I THINK IT SUD HAVE AT LEAST MEMORY SLOT, AND SPEAKERS ARE VERY BAD...THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE,,,,,OTHERWISE THE HANDSET IS GOOD......DUAL CORE PROCESSOR IS ALSO THE GOOD THING. ..........................................."
Xperia U,3,"BASICALLY, THIS MOB IS GOOD, HAS GOT SOME GUD FEATURES AT A DECENT PRICE TAG ,HOWEVER A FEW CONS THAT I FELT ARE:-
      
      
      -&GT; LACKS SOUND CLARITY.
      
      I WAS SURPRISED WITH ITS INABILITY TO PROVIDE SOUND CLARITY AT HIGH VOLUME (DISTORTED).
      
      EVEN A 5-6K PRICED NEW GENERATION MOBILE WOULD  PROVIDE GOOD SOUND CLARITY!!
      
      
      -&GT;TOUCH-SENSITIVITY RELATED COMPLAINTS
      
      
      ANYWAY, ITS OVERALL QUALITY/USABILITY IS GOOD."
Xperia U,3,"DUAL CORE ANDROIDS WITH 512 MB RAM ALWAYS LIMIT THE POSSIBILITIES OF COMPLETE UTILIZATION OF GAMES AND APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID. BUT ITS GOOD THAT XPERIA U IS USING MALI 400 GPU WHICH WOULD HELP PLAY GRAPHIC RICH GAMES WITH REASONABLE DETAILS EVEN THOUGH RAM IS LIMITED.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EXTREMELY SLICK ANDROID PHONE AND WANTS TO  BROWSE, SIMULTANEOUSLY RUN SOME APPLICATIONS OR TO PLAY GRAPHIC RICH GAMES WITH EXTREME EASE THEN LOOK ELSEWHERE"
Xperia U,3,FIRST OF ALL... IS A SMARTPHONE AND NOT A FREAKING PC OR FOR THAT MATTER A TOY... IF CAN'T MANAGE YOUR MEMORY PROPERLY AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONSERVE SPACE DON'T BUY IT... WHAT TO KEEP ON A PHONE AND WHAT NOT DEN YOU DON'T DESERVE TO USE IT... JUST BCOZ YOU WANT TO CRITICIZE A PHONE DOESN'T MEAN U TALK SHIT... I OWN A OMNIA.. IT HAS 8GB MEMORY NON EXPANDABLE AND I FIND IT SUFFICIENT... BCOZ I KNOW WHAT I HAVE USE MY PHONE FOR... SO GO AND GET A LIFE... OR IF YOU WANT TO CRITICIZE GO N BLOG IT.. DON'T MISLEAD BUYERS... AND DON'T TRY TO SHOW UR HALF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THINGS.. I HAVE READ MANY SUPPORTIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PHONE ON THE SITE... AND I AGREE WITH THOSE PPL... AND YOU CAN'T A PHONE THAT HAS EVERYTHING... U HAVE TO MAKE COMPROMISE AND UNDERSTAND... ONLY DRAWBACK IS.. IT SHOULD HAVE HAD ICS...
Xperia U,3,"FIRST THINGS FIRST - FLIPKART DELIVERY
      
      ORDERED THIS PHONE FOR MY WIFE, DELIVERY TOOK A BIT LONGER THAN MY PREVIOUS FLIPKART EXPERIENCES. WONDER WHY?
      
      
      COMING TO THE MAIN POINT
      
      I OWN A GALAXY NOTE FROM LAST 4 MONTHS. I ALWAYS ADMIRE HOW SAMSUNG CHANGED THEIR PRODUCTSCAPE IN LCD/LED TELEVISION AND MOBILE MARKET AND I REALIZED WHY WHEN I UNBOXED THE SONY XPERIA U.
      
      
      I WAS FRANTICALLY SEARCHING EVERYWHERE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO TAKE THE BATTERY COVER OUT. ON CONTRARY THIS WAS THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WHEN I UNBOXED GALAXY NOTE. THEN YOU TUBE CAME TO THE RESCUE.
      
      
      NOT THAT I AM DEPENDENT ON THE MANUAL FOR OPERATING, BUT, MY WIFE WANTED SOME BASIC ""HOW TO"" AND SHE HAD TO DEPEND ON ME OR GOOGLE.
      
      
      SONY GROW UP! IF YOU WANT TO REMAIN IN COMPETITION, A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THIS MATTERS.
      
      
      THE PHONE PER SE IS GOOD. I LIKED THE BODY, IT DOESN'T HAVE  CHEAP PLASTIC FEEL. THE SIZE IS OK. CALL QUALITY WAS GOOD. STANDARD ANDROID INTERFACE FOR CONTACTS.
      
      
      THE HOME KEY, BACK KEY IN THE BOTTOM PART OF THE PHONE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE EVEN A ""HOME"",""BACK"" SYMBOL TO IDENTIFY. IT TOOK A WHILE FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT PLACEMENT OF THESE KEYS.
      
      
      MAY BE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN USING GALAXY NOTE, THE SCREEN SEEMED TO BE TOO SMALL. BUT IT IS DECENT.
      
      
      THEY HAD GIVEN A SCREEN GUARD WITH IT, WHICH I COULDN'T FIX IT MYSELF, SO I ENDED UP WITH BUBBLES AND HAD TO FINALLY THROW IT. I AM USING IT WITHOUT THE SCREEN GUARD,  I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS NEEDED OR PRESCRIBED BY SONY.  AGAIN A MANUAL WOULD HAVE HELPED.
      
      
      IS IT A CORNING GUERILA GLASS - I DON'T KNOW, COULDN'T FIND IT?
      
      
      HAD TONS OF USELESS APPS PRE-LOADED. FELT SPAMMED THE MOMENT THE PHONE WENT ALIVE DUE TO THIS. UNINSTALLED EVERYTHING.
      
      
      DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET AN ICS UPGRADE. AGAIN NOTHING MENTIONED. I KNOW GOOGLE WILL RESCUE.
      
      
      I MADE A CONFERENCE CALL, AND IT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL DUE TO THE NETWORK ISSUE. BUT WHEN I CALLED MY FRIED AFTER THIS, I COULDN'T HEAR THE VOICE FROM THE OTHER SIDE. I HAD TO RESTART MY PHONE TO FIX IT. BUG? I GUESS SO.
      
      
      PRETTY SLOW BROWSING EXPERIENCE EVEN OVER A GOOD WIFI NETWORK.
      
      
      OVERALL, I UNDERSTAND I CAN'T EXPECT A NOTE FOR HALF ITS PRICE, BUT SAMSUNG LINE US IS TOUGH COMPETITION TO THIS PHONE. THE ONLY REASON I WENT FOR THIS IS TRUSTING THE DUAL CORE, AND ANDRIOD OS.
      
      PHONE IS AVERAGE I WOULD SAY, EVEN WHEN COMPARED TO THE SIMILAR SEGMENT, BUT THE EXPERIENCE SUCKS."
Xperia U,3,"FIRST THINGS FIRST, I DID ORDER THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART BUT LATER ON DUE TO DELAY IN DELIVERY I HAVE CANCELLED THE ORDER(MY EARLIER REVIEW WAS ON FLIPKART SERVICE WHICH HAS BEEN DELETED BY THEM NOW!). SO I BOUGHT THE PHONE FROM A SHOP NEARBY(GOD KNOWS WHY I DIDN'T DID IT EARLIER AS THEY ARE GIVING AT THE SAME PRICE)
      
      
      THE VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE PHONE-
      
      1. LOOKS- THE DESIGN, ILLUMINATING BAR
      
      2. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND PICTURE DISPLAY- ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!
      
      3. THE PRICE
      
      
      THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE PHONE-
      
      1. FAST INTERNET AND GAME PLAYING
      
      2. NICE INTEGRATION WITH FACEBOOK
      
      3. BATTERY RECHARGE IS VERY FAST (40 MINS FOR FULL CHARGE)
      
      4. DUAL CAMERA
      
      
      THE BAD THINGS ABOUT THE PHONE-
      
      1. BATTERY BACKUP (YES YES THATS'S AN ANDROID ISSUE)
      
      2. HEATS UP WHILE PLAYING GAMES
      
      3. CALL VOLUME IS NOT UPTO THE MARK
      
      4. SPEAKERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOUDER
      
      
      THE VERY BAD THINGS ABOUT THE PHONE-
      
      1. HD VIDEO PLAYBACK IS VERY DISSATISFACTORY
      
      2. WHILE USING FLASH, THE PICTURE COMES ALL WHITE
      
      
      OVERALL, AT THIS PRICE RANGE THERE'S NOTHING COMPARED TO IT, IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET GO FOR NOKIA LUMIA 800, OTHERWISE YOU CAN BUY IT"
Xperia U,3,"HAD VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS WID THIS CELL....FOR ME STORAGE WAS NEVER A CONCERN...ALL I KNEW WHEN I WAS PLACING AN ORDER FOR THIS CELL WAS A DUAL CORE PROCCESSOR ND DISPLAY OF MALI 400...ND BOTH UNDER PERFORMED FOR ME...RAM 512 MB IS NOT ENOUGH...USB OTG ???? COMON SONY DATS NT A SOLUTION FOR STORAGE....THE LIGHT STRIP IS GOOD...BUT IF U LOOKIN FORWARD FOR A VERY RESPONSIVE PHONE THAN THIS IS NT THE OPTION..BETTER SAVE SOME MORE BUCKS ND GO FOR XPERIA P..COZ IT IL B WORTH IT WID 1GB RAM ND MICRO SD CARD SLOT
      
      IN THE END ITS A GOOD CELL IF UR BUDGET STRANGLED AROUND 15K"
Xperia U,3,"HEY GUYS I BUYED DIS PHN FRM FLIPKART ITS AN AMAZING SMART PHN IN BUDGET UNLESS U UPGRADE IT TO ICS I AM FACING PROBLEM AFTER UPGRADING DIS CELL IN ICS ITS STARTED HANGING,NTEWORK ISSUES AND MANY MORE PROBLEMS"
Xperia U,3,"HI ALL,
      
      
      JUST TO MAKE THE REVIEW SIMPLE, I WOULD RATE THIS 7/10. IF THE CAMERA WAS GOOD ENOUGH, I WOULD HAVE LIKED A 8/10 PHONE. FOR, THE COLOUR SATURATION IS POOR, AND CLARITY/FOCUS ALSO NOT UPTO THE MARK.
      
      
      PROS: GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY, I HEARD ICS ANDROID 4.0 UPGRADE IS ASSURED.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. CAMERA IS NOT UPTO THE MARK FOR THIS 16K PHONE, ISSUES WITH COLOUR SATURATION AND CLARITY. THE EARLIER VERSION OF XPERIA MINI PRO, HAS BETTER CAMERA. THIS IS NOT NOTICEABLE IN THE LED SCREEN OF THE PHONE, WHICH ACTUALLY ENHANCES THE PICS. WHEN YOU LOAD AND VIEW ON PC, YOU WILL NOTICE.
      
      2. LIMITED 4 GB INTERNAL STORAGE IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR ME, IT HAS USB ON THE GO - I HAVE TRIED AND IT WORK FINE - A CABLE FOR RS 150 IS REQUIRED.
      
      3. OTHER MINOR SOFTWARE ISSUES - WHICH OBVIOUSLY NO ANDROID USERS NEED TO WORRY, AS FIXES WOULD BE AVAILABLE FREE. I FACED CALLS GOING MUTE A FEW TIMES, BUT NOT AFTER ONE UPGRADE. PERHAPS IT IS NOT AN ISSUE ANYMORE.
      
      
      PROS: OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS GOOD ONE. VERY SMOOTH DISPLAY, FAST RESPONSIVE DUE TO 1 GHZ PROCESSOR, VERY GOOD RESOLUTION, BATTER LIFE/POWER EFFICIENCY IS GOOD FOR AN ANDROID PHONE. HAS GOT FRONT CAMERA, WHICH IS BETTER THAN MISSING MEMORY CARD SLOT (MEMORY SLOT CAN BE MANAGED WITH USB ON THE GO, BUT NOT FRONT CAM."
Xperia U,3,"HI ALL,
      
      PROS N CORNS OF THIS PHONE ARE :
      
      CORNS:
      
      1)3.5 INCH DISPLAY IS SMALL WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES AT 15K RANGE.
      
      2)SPEAKER VOLUME IS TOO LOW, WE ARE NOT ABLE HEAR MOBILE RINGTONE WHEN WE ARE IN CROUD.
      
      3)BATTERY COULD HAVE 1500MAH FOR BETTER BATTERY BACKUP.
      
      4)NOW-A-DAYS ALL MOBLIES COMING WITH ANDROID4.0 VERSION.BUT THIS MOBILE IS STILL HAS OLDER VERSION FROM FACTORY .
      
      PROS:
      
      1)CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      2)SHARP DESIGN"
Xperia U,3,"HI EVERYONE,
      
      I BROUGHT THIS PHONE 2 DAYS BACK..
      
      THE PHONE IS A GOOD ONE
      
      I JUST WANT TO TELL THE PROBLEMS REGARDING THIS PHONE.
      
      1) ITS GETS HEATED UP PRETTY FASTLY.
      
      2)BATTERY DRAINS OUT VERY FASTLY. (EVEN IF THEY SAY THAT BRAVIA ENGINE IS VERY POWER EFFICIENT, WHAT I CAN SEE IS THAT ITS ONLY IN PAPER)
      
      3)YOU CAN'T TURN OFF THE STRIP LIGHT, THERE IS NO DEFAULT OPTION FOR IT, THOUGH THERE IS A APPLICATION AVAILABLE FOR IT(NIGHT MODE)
      
      YOU MIGHT WANNA TURN OFF THE LIGHT AFTER YOU EXPERIENCE ITS BATTERY LIFE
      
      4) THE PHONE WAS A KINDA OF SLIPPERY(MAY BE MY BAD  :))
      
      5) THE CAMERA BUTTON IS NOT THAT GUD, YOU GOTTA PRESS IT REALLY HARD TO OPEN THE CAMERA.
      
      OTHERWISE ITS A GUD PHONE, LOOKS ARE REALLY GUD AND KINDA CUTE.
      
      
      DID NOT BUY IT FROM FLIPKART..BUT FROM A SHOP  :)"
Xperia U,3,HI FRIENDS I AM A SONY ERRICSON LIVE WITH WALKMAN USER AND ONE THING I WANT TO TELL THAT ON MY BIRTHDAY I RECORDED WITH IT AT 720P(HD) AND TOOK FEW SNAPS AND MY 1GB MEMORY WAS FULL....THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS 4GB  MEMORY IS TOO LESS TO BE IN A SMARTPHONE....
Xperia U,3,HI I BOUGHT THIS TWO DAYS BACK AND I UPGRADED THE OS VERSION. EXCEPT MY BLUETOOTH ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY IS WORKING GOOD. MY BLUETOOTH IS NOT EVEN GETTING ON. ITS COMING AS THERE IS NO BLUETOOTH FIRMWARE. COULD SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE?
Xperia U,3,"HI, I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART  AND FLIPKART SERVICE IS REALLY VERY GOOD .
      
      HERE ARE SOME PROS AND CONS ABOUT THIS PHONE
      
      PROS
      
      1. ONLY DUAL CORE MOBILE IN THIS PRICE RANGE (IN TRUSTED COMPANIES)
      
      2. SCREEN RESOLUTION IS VERY HIGH 324 PPI
      
      3. TOUCH IS VERY GOOD
      
      4. SOUND QUALITY REALLY IMPRESSIVE
      
      5. VERY NICE CAMERA QUALITY
      
      6. HD VIDEO RECORDING AND VIDEO PLAYBACK
      
      
      CONS.
      
      
      1. SCREEN WIDTH IS THE SMALLEST IN THE SMARTPHONE SERIES (ONLY 54 MM) SO IT IS IRRITATING      MOST OF THE TIME.
      
      2. THE LIGHT BELT AT THE BOTTOM IS VERY NICE BUT THERE IS NO OPTION IF YOU WANT IT OFF.
      
      3. NO MEMORY CARD SLOT. SO IT SAYS 8 GB BUT ONLY 4  GB IS USER AVAILABLE.
      
      4. VIBRATION MODE OF PHONE IS LIKE A DISASTER."
Xperia U,3,I BOUGHT THIS PHONE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO ... AND I COME TO KNOW THAT THERE IS NO ICS UPDATE AVAILABLE FOR THIS THIS PHONE... THE SERVICE CENTRE GUYS SAYS IT WILL BE AVAILABE BY THE MONTH END... M UPSET I BOUGHT A GINGER BREAD PHONE IN EXCHANGE OF MY GINGER BREAD PHONE....
Xperia U,3,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IN NOVEMBER AND USING IT SINCE.
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. GUD SCREEN CLARITY.
      
      2. NO SUPPORT TO MEMORY CARD, STOPS YOU FROM KEEPING ALL JUNK ITEMS AND YOU KEEP YOUR PHONE DATA CLEAN.
      
      3. USB ON THE GO SUPPORT (THIS HELPS WHEN YOU RUN INTO MEMORY ISSUES FOR MOVIES)
      
      NOTE: USB ON THE GO IS NOT SUPPORTING CARD READERS.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1.LOW SPEAKER SOUND. MANY A TIMES WITHOUT XLOUD ON, I WONT BE ABLE TO HEAR RINGTONES OUTSIDE.
      
      2. LOW SOUND IN HEADPHONES TOO.
      
      3. CAMERA TAKES A COUPLE OF SECONDS TO TAKE PHOTO AFTER YOU CLICK.
      
      4. BATTERY BACKUP IS LITTLE LOW.
      
      5. SCREEN LOVES FINGERPRINTS AND KEEPS THEM SAFE. YOU HAVE TO USE A NAPKIN TO WIPE THE SCREEN CLEAN.
      
      6. AT TIMES,PHONE LAGS FOR NO APPARENT REASON.
      
      
      A GUD PHONE, BUT BETTER PHONES ARE IN MARKET NOW.
      
      PLS THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING"
Xperia U,3,"I DONNO HW TO CONNECT PENDRIVE... OTG S NT WORKING.. COULD ANYONE TEL ME T SOLUTION???? CAMERA CLARITY IS NOT TOOO GUD .... TFT DISPLAY S XCELLENT ... I BOUGHT TIS FOR 16K , BT I THINK ITS NOT WORTH FOR 16K"
Xperia U,3,"I GOT THIS PHONE VIA FLIPKART LAST WEEK AND AGAIN EXCELLENT SERVICE FROM FLIPCART.THANKS FLIPKART!!
      
      
      THE PHONE HAS VERY KILLER LOOKS AND DESIGN. ALSO ,TECHNICALLY ITS VERY STRONG AND WORKS VERY SMOOTH FOR HIGH END APPLICATIONS AND GAMES AS WELL. I DID NOT FOUND ANY LAG WHILE PLAYING WITH IT.
      
      
      BUT I AM FACING ONE MAJOR ISSUE WITH IT. PHONE FREQUENTLY SHOW NO SERVICE FOR MOBILE OPERATOR AND WHEN IT LOOSE SERVICE ONLY OPTION I HAVE TO RESTART IT TO RESUME.I TRIED  CHANGING OPERATOR SIM BUT SAME ISSUE WITH ALL AND PHONE SOFTWARE UPDATE ALSO DID NOT HELPED.FINALLY I HAVE RAISED CASE WITH SONY MOBILE SUPPORT AND WAITING FOR THEIR REPLY OR ELSE FLIPKART IS THERE TO GIVE ME REPLACEMENT!!"
Xperia U,3,"I HAD BEEN USING A 16 GB SAMSUNG GALAXY S FR OVER AN YEAR. THT IS WEN I WS GIFTED THE XPERIA U. I FOUND THE PHONE EXTREMELY GOOD IN ALMOST MOST ASPECTS, EXCEPT FOR THE MEMORY  PART. MIGRAATING FROM A MOB WITH 16 GB INTERNAL HARD DISK ND A 16 GB MEMORY CARD TO A MOB WITH 4 GB MEMORY WAS TOUGH. I HAD COLLECTION OF MOVIES ND SONGS AND PHOTOS. AFTER LOADING JUST THE PHOTOS AND HALF THE SONGS, THE PHONE WAS FULL.ND TO THOSE IGNORANT PPL SAYIN THT HD MOVIES R 890 MB, GAIN KNOWLEDGE ABT SOMETHING BEFORE BLABBERING. HD MOVIES R ATLEAST 2.5 GB ABOVE. THE 890 MB HD MOVIES U TALKIN ABOUT IS THE RIP VERSION U GUYS DOWNLOD FRM THE NET. ALL IN ALL,GOOD PHONE, BUT LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED. I USED IT FOR TWO WEEKS, SOLD IT AND GT THE XPERIA P."
Xperia U,3,"I HAVE BEEN USING THE PHONE FOR THE LAST 1 MONTH. HERE IS MY EXPERIENCE
      
      
      STORAGE:
      
      
      I KNEW THAT IT HAS LIMITED STORAGE, BUT STILL BOUGHT IT... SO CAN'T COMPLAIN. THOUGH, I RAN OUT OF SPACE PRETTY QUICKLY
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      
      IT IS NOT SO GREAT AS SOME OF THE USERS HAVE SAID. IT IS JUST OK. BUT, I FIND THE VIDEO RECORDING VERY HANDY. I WOULD USE THE THIS PHONE FOR VIDEO RECORDING INSTEAD OF MY DSLR
      
      
      PROCESSOR:
      
      
      INITIALLY IT WAS SNAPPY, BUT AFTER THE ICS UPDATE.. IT IS DRAGGING ON ITS FEET. HOPEFULLY, SONY WILL COME UP WITH SOME OPTIMIZATION PATCHES
      
      
      AUDIO:
      
      
      THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD. THE XTRALOUD (OR WHATEVER) IS KIND OF STUPID GIMMICK FROM SONY. STILL, I PRIMARILY USE THE PHONE TO LISTEN SONGS.
      
      
      LOOKS:
      
      
      I JUST LOVE THIS BRICK STYLE. IT IS NOT HUGE LIKE THE S3 NOR SMALL.. JUST FITS INTO MY PALM.. PERFECT :)
      
      
      SERVICE FROM FLIPKART:
      
      
      AS ALWAYS IT IS FAST. ACTUALLY, I HAVE ASKED FOR A PURE WHITE PHONE BUT GOT DELIEVERED A BLACK ONE. RIGHT AFTER THE DELIEVERY I FACED AN ISSUE WITH THE PHONE. WHENEVER
      
      I TURN ON THE 3G, MY INCOMING CALLS GOT DROPPED. SO, I CALLED UP FLIPKART THEY SUGGESTED FEW FIXES.. NOW IT WORKS FINE (I AM NOT USING 3G, BUT 2G NOW). I THANK FLIPKART FOR RESOLVING THE ISSUE.
      
      
      OVERALL:
      
      
      SINCE, THE PRICE DROPPED A LITTLE.. MAY BE ITS A GOOD BUY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE SONY FOR THIER STYLISH PRODUCTS.
      
      FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT BETTER CONFIGURATION GO LOOK FOR OTHER MODELS."
Xperia U,3,I JUST BOUGHT SONY XPERIA U BUT APPARENTLY THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR SOFTWARE BECAUSE WHEN I MAKE A CALL AFTER THE CALL THE RINGTONE FOR THE MSG'S DOESN'T EXISTS. I HAVE SEEN FROM DIFFERENT FORUMS THAT PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I TOOK IT BACK THEY SAID IT'S OK BUT IT'S NOT. I HAVE STILL THE SAME PROBLEM. HOW CAN YOU SELL SOMETHING THAT ISN'T WORKING PROPERLY.
Xperia U,3,"I PERSONALLY FEEL SONY SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED A MICROSD CARD SLOT ON THIS PHONE
      
      EVEN ENTRY LEVEL PHONE UNDER 1.5K FROM NOKIA HAVE MICROSD CARD SLOT I WOULD RATHER PAY MORE THAN OPTING FOR LESS PRICE W/O MEMORY CARD SLOT. IDONT SEE ANY LOGIC BEHIND IT.APPLICATIONS THESE DAY REQUIRE MORE MEMORY N SO SD CARD MEANS U CANT EVEN MOVE THEM FRANKLY SPEAKING ITS NOT GONNA WORK W/O MEMORY CARD
      
      CZ I HAVE 4GB+ SONGS AND VIDEOS IN MY PHONE U WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO WATCH THE MEMORY NOT GETTING FULL
      
      BUT GOOD POINT IS AT LEAT THIS PHONE HAVE A FRONT CAMERA UNLIKE SOLA WHICH IS PRICED HIGHER THAN THIS PHONE N DOESNT HAVE A FRONT CAMERA...
      
      PUT A MICRO SD CARD SLOT OR AT LEAST 8GB USER AVAILABLE MEMORY... I WOULD HAPPILY GIVE THEN 5 STARS"
Xperia U,3,I PURCHASED THIS PHONE IN THE LAST WEEK OF APRIL I AM VERY HAPPY TO SEE THIS BUT DISAPOINTED BY THIS BATTERY  IT DRAINED VERY FAST WITHOUT USING ANY WI FI AS WELL AS MOBILE NETWORK. SCREEN DISPLAY IS ALSO SMALL YOU CANT WRITE MESSAGE EASILY AND ONE MORE THING THEME OF MESSAGE AS WELL AS PHONE BOOK IS SO DARK NOT EASY TO READ OR WRITE DURING DAY TIME.
Xperia U,3,"I TOOK THIS PHONE ON FEB 2013, I FELT VERY AWESOME TO USE THIS PHONE BECOZ ITS MY FIRST ANDROID PHONE. EVEN THOUGH THE BATTERY BACKUP SUCKS, I NEVER FELT ANY BAD DUE TO ITS AWESOME FEATURES. IT FULFILLED ALL MY EXPECTATIONS WITH A GOOD PERFORMANCE, RESOLUTION, SPEED ETC. I GOT AMAZED WITH THE FEATURES OF SCREENSHOT AND CAMERA BUTTON(BY WHICH U CAN TAKE PICS ON A SINGLE PRESS EVEN THE SCREEN IS LOCKED). IT WORKED MY FINE WHILE I WAS NAVIGATING TO  UNKNOWN PLACES. BUT SUDDENLY THINGS WENT WRONG...
      
      IT WENT ON FEW DROPS OF WATER WHILE I WAS WASHING MY HANDS, I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE BATTERY OFF AND TOOK IT TO SERVICE CENTER, THEY KEPT IT A DAY AND REPLIED ME AS ""IT IS WATER DAMAGED, NO ONE CAN DO ANY THING"". I WAS SHOCKED TO LISTEN THAT, I THOUGHT THEY ARE NOT CORRECT BECOZ MY STRONG FEELING IS ""HOW CAN A 15K PHONE BECOME DEAD WITH A FEW DROPS OF WATER, IT MAY NOT BE FULLY WATER RESIST, BUT WOULD BE ENOUGH RESIST FOR SMALL SORT OF DROPS.' I TOOK TO 2 TO 3 SERVICE CENTERS AND EVEN LOCAL CENTERS, I SPENT ONE COMPLETE WEEK IN MAKING UP THIS PHONE BETTER, BUT THINGS DOESNT WENT GOOD.
      
      IT WAS GONE AND IT WILL BECOME OK IF U CHANGE COME MOTHER BOARD(WHICH WORTH 7 TO 8K). IT BECAME USELESS AND NOW I DONT HAVE ANY INTREST TO BUY ONE MORE PHONE. I WENT BACK TO MY NOKIA 7210.
      
      MY SINCERE SUGGESTION IS PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS PHONE IF U CANNOT HANDLE IT PROPERLY(BECOZ IT SHOULD BE HANDLED SUCH THAT NO DUST, NO WATER SHOULD TOUCH IT).... :-("
Xperia U,3,"I WANT TO SAY THAT THERE IS GREAT COMPETITION GOING ON IN MARKET FOR SMARTPHONES. SAMSUNG,SONY AND LG ARE PRICING PHONES FOR THE ARM V11 PROCESSOR PHONES WHICH IS MUCH HIGHER THEN THE ACTUAL COST.
      
      MICROMAX IS GIVING ALL THE FEATURES FOR RS 10000
      
      JUST CHECKOUT THE PROCESSORS SAMSUNG AND SONY ARE GIVING AND THEN DECIDE WHICH PHONE TO TAKE.
      
      THE BEST PROCESSOR IS NVIDIA TEGRA 2 AND 3 AND RAM IS 1  GB DDR3 IN MOBILES."
Xperia U,3,I WAS A BIG FAN OF XPERIA U BUT LAST WEEKEND SONY REVEALED JELLYBEAN WONT BE PROVIDED FOR XPERIA U AND WITHIN A WEEK SONY UNVEILS XPERIA J 4INCH SCREEN WITH ICS UPGRADABLE FOR  JELLYBEAN SO I SUGGEST XPERIA J
Xperia U,3,I WAS JUST GOING THRU THE SPECS OF THE FONES WHILE COMPARING AND I REALIZED THERE IS NO WARRANTY....DONT KNOW KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS NO WARRANTY BUT IM GUESSING THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT OF A DEFECTIVE PIECE AND ALSO SINCE SONY BY ITSELF IS A RELATIVELY NEW COMPANY(APART FROM SONY ERICSSON)THEY MUST NOT BE HAVING MANY REPAIRING CENTERS...GOOD BUY OTHERWISE....
Xperia U,3,"I WAS VERY EAGER TO BUY THIS MOBILE.. IT HAS ALL THE BEST FEATURES.
      
      -5 MEGA PIXEL CAMERA
      
      -HD VIDEO
      
      -DUAL CORE
      
      -FRONT CAMERA
      
      -3.5 INCH SCREEN SIZE ETC
      
      
      BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE MEMORY CARD SLOT AND HAS THE SAR VALUE 1.62 W/KG.. THOSE TWO ISSUE ARE VERY HIGH DRAWBACKS IN THIS MOBILE.. SO I REJECTED THIS.. AND SEARCHING FOR SOME OTHER GOOD MOBILE.."
Xperia U,3,"IF YOU SEARCH FOR SONY XPERIA U, THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT COLORED PHONES. EXCEPT THIS ONE, OTHER TWO PHONES HAVE BACK PHOTOS AS WELL AND COLOR OF BACK IS AS SAME AS FRONT. SINCE THIS PHONE DOES NOT HAVE BACK PHOTO, I EXPECTED IT TO BE AS SAME AS OTHER TWO PHONES HAVING SAME BACK COLOR AS FRONT ONE(HUMAN TENDENY RIGHT). BUT YES, I TOO RESPONSIBLE FOR BUYING THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT MAKING ANY ENQUIRY AS MY PAST TRANSACTIONS WERE AWESOME WITH FLIPKART
      
      
      WHEN I CONTACTED FLIPKART, THEY SAID THAT I SHOULD HAVE CALLED THEM BEFORE BUYING THIS PRODUCT AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE NOW. TOO MUCH BELIEF WILL LEAD TO DISAPPOINTMENT IS SAME EVERYWHERE! THIS TRANSACTION ALONG WITH SAMSUNG GRAND HAS CHANGED MY ENTIRE PERSPECTIVE ON FLIPKART."
Xperia U,3,"IN THIS PHONE. THE BATTERY IS VERY AVERAGE. ONLY TWO THING IS GOOD 1. DISPLAY 2. MUSIQ EFFECT
      
      REMAINS ALL WORST. MAKE MUTE WEN MAKING CALL IF I CONNECTED HEADPHONE IN THE MOBILE.
      
      1 GHZ DUAL CORE GOOD AND IT MAKE SYSTEM FAST"
Xperia U,3,"IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS SOME EXPANDABLE MEMORY. BUT  SONY ANNOUNCED A NEW ONE WITH ALMOST ALL THE FEATURES OF XPERIA U. PLEASE CHECK THE BELOW LINK.
      
      
      WWW.SONYMOBILE.COM/IN/PRODUCTS/PHONES/XPERIA-GO/"
Xperia U,3,"LOADED WITH LOT MANY NEW FEATURES BUT WHEN I COMPARE IT AS A PHONE WITH MY NOKIA 5800XPRESSMUSIC ITS NOT THAT CONVINIENT. MULTITASKING IS NOT THERE, DTM (DUAL TRANSFER MODE) IS NOT THERE HENCE DATA TRANSFER IS NOT POSSIBLE IN 2G WHILE BEING ON CALL. NO VIDEO CALL EVEN WHEN THERE IS A FRONT CAMERA.SOUND IS OK BUT SPEAKERS ARE MONO NOT STEREO. GPS AND GOOGLE MAP IS EXCELLENT. BATTERY BACKUP IS EXTREAMLY POOR.HANDSFREE HAS MINIMUM OPTIONS AND EVEN A COLLOR CLIP IS NOT THERE. HANDSFREE EARPLUGS ARE NO MORE OLD SONY ERICSSON WALKMAN TYPE BUT ARE CHEAP CHINESE ONES. RAM IS VERY LESS AND IS A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT. ONLY 4 GB IS AVAILABLE FOR USER REST IS FOR SYSTEM AND APPLICATIONS MANAGED BY SYSTEM INTERNALLY."
Xperia U,3,"MAIN FEATURES:
      
      USB HOST OR USB OTG SUPPORT(WE CAN CONNECT PENDRIVES, COMPUTER KEYBOARDS ETC TO THIS PHONE)
      
      GOOD LOOKS(TRANSPARENT COLOUR CHANGING STRIP ATTRACTS EVERYBODY)
      
      GOOD PERFORMANCE WITH 512MB RAM AND 1GHZ DUAL CORE PROCESSOR
      
      GREAT DISPLAY AND CAMERA QUALITY (LOW LIGHT SHOTS ARE POOR)
      
      USB HOST (WE CAN CONNECT PENDRIVES, COMPUTER KEYBOARDS ETC TO THIS PHONE)
      
      
      POOR BATTERY
      
      POOR TOUCH SCREEN(IT'S TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT SO GOOD.TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS VERY POOR AT A PORTION)
      
      POOR QUALITY INBUILT SPEAKER(BUT, SOUND OUTPUTTED THROUGH IT'S 3.5MM JACK IS GOOD.)
      
      
      MY OPINION ABOUT THIS PHONE:
      
      
      HEY GUYS,
      
      I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM FLIPKART... IN THE BEGINNING, IT WORKED WELL.. THE MOST WONDERFUL THING IN IT IS IT'S USB OTG SUPPORT... THIS FEATURE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN MOST OF THE OTHER SMARTPHONES.. BUT LATER, I NOTICED IT'S POOR TOUCH SCREEN.. TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS VERY POOR COMPARED TO OTHER COMPETETORS..IT IS DUE TO THIS REASON THAT TYPING IS DIFFICULT IN IT. (BUT, YOU CAN CONNECT EVEN A COMPUTER USB KEYBOARD TO IT)
      
      THE PROCESSOR DOES A GOOD JOB.. BUT, IT DOSENT SUPPORT 1080P VIDEOS.. PLAYING 1080P VIDEOS ARE LAGGING, EVEN IF WE HAVE MX PLAYER IN IT..
      
      HOWEVER, OVERALL LOOKS ARE GOOD.. CAMERA QUALITY TOO..
      
      IT'S CAMERA IS SIMILAR TO THE SONY CYBERSHOT. WE CAN EVEN TAKE 3D PHOTOS WITH IT.. DAYLIGHT PHOTOS ARE AWESOME.. BUT, LOW LIGHT PHOTOS ARE POOR.. IT'S 720P VIDEOS ARE ALSO GOOD.
      
      
      SO, IF U NEED A BETTER CAMERA, SPEED AND USB CONNEVTIVITY, AND DO NOT CARE ABOUT TOUCH SENSITIVITY, GO FOR IT.."
Xperia U,3,"MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER IT'S RELEASE, THIS PHONE STILL HOLDS ITS OWN IN IT'S PRICE SEGMENT.
      
      
      PROS: PIXEL CLARITY IS AMAZING, PHONE LOOKS BRILLIANT, TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS GOOD. CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD.
      
      
      CONS: HANGS OFTEN, EVEN FOR BASIC OPERATIONS SUCH AS PHONE CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGING. CANNOT HANDLE TOO MANY APPS AT A TIME. BATTERY LIFE IS PRETTY PATHETIC, BUT IF YOU SWITCH OFF MOBILE DATA, IT CAN LAST A DAY. PICTURES WITH FLASH ON ARE TERRIBLE.
      
      
      CONCLUSION: IF YOU ARE A TECHIE GUY LOOKING FOR A GOOD PERFORMING ANDROID PHONE, THEN I SUGGEST YOU TO INVEST A LITTLE MORE N GO FOR OTHER OPTIONS. THIS PHONE JUST CANT HANDLE IT. HOWEVER, IF YOUR BUDGET IS LESS THAN 12K THEN THIS IS YOUR BEST BET."
Xperia U,3,"NETWORK PROBLEMS HAPPENING IN THOSE SETS WHOSE FIRMWARE BEEN UPDATED AND SECONDLY CAMERA IS ALSO NOT UPTO THE MARK. ONE CAN SEE PHOTO COMPARISON TOOL AT GSMARENA. VERY MUCH NOISE IS PRESENT IN PICS AND VIDEO IS ALSO NOT MUCH CLEAR.
      
      AND THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING WHICH MANY PEOPLE IGNORE WHILE BUYING A MOBILE I.E. SAR VALUE AND FOR SONY XPERIA U ITS 1.62W/KG WHICH IS VERY HIGH."
Xperia U,3,"NICE SERVICE BY FLIPKART... RECEIVED THE ORDER WITHIN 2 DAYS.
      
      THE PHONE WORKED BRILLIANT INITIALLY , SMOOTH GRAPHICS , EASY TO HANDLE WITH ONE HAND , LIGHT , STYLISH...
      
      BUT RECENTLY AFTER 3 MONTHS OF BUYING , IT HAS STARTED GIVING ME TOUCH PROBLEMS. TYPING BECOMES REALLY VERY DIFFICULT , SOME PORTIONS OF THE SCREEN BECOME UNRESPONSIVE.
      
      I NEED TO TAKE SOME TIME OUT AND TAKE THIS PHONE TO THE SERVICE CENTER NOW. BUT I AM DEFINITELY DISAPPOINTED.
      
      THE GOOD THING IS , IT NEVER GAVE ME PROCESSOR RELATED ISSUES , AND AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED , THE STORAGE SPACE IS ENOUGH.
      
      I DONT KNOW IF I AM QUITE UNLUCKY TO FACE THE TOUCH PROBLEM , I DONT KNOW IF IT HAPPENS SO OFTEN WITH SONY PHONES OR NOT.
      
      BUT I REGRET A LITTLE TO HAVE SPENT 16.5K ON THIS PHONE.
      
      NOW I NEED TO GET IT REPAIRED WITHIN 3 MONTHS :("
Xperia U,3,"NO DOUBT THAT THE PHONE HAS A LITTLE MEMORY IN COMPARE TO OTHERS PHONE IN THE MARKET IN SAME PRICE.
      
      THE BATTERY BACK UP IS A MAJOR PROBLEM IN SONY'S PHONE IN COMPARE TO OTHERS COMPANY LIKE NOKIA.
      
      THE COMPANY MAIN REASON FOR THE LESS MEMORY CAPACITY GIVEN TO THIS PHONE IS OF THE PRICE MATTERS I.E THEY DO NOT WANT TO GIVE MUCH IN THE PARTICULAR RANGE.
      
      ALTHOUGH THE PHONE COME WITH LATEST OS VERSION AND GOOD PROCESSOR BUT STILL YOU CANT MISS THE BASE PART.
      
      THE COMPANY MAKE OBVIOUSLY  THE GOOD PRODUCT BUT NOT AS THE COMPLETE PACKAGE FOR THE CUSTOMER AS WE WANT MORE.
      
      THE 4GB MEMORY SUPPORT IS NOT ENOUGH I GUESS FOR SUCH HUGE MOBILE PHONES WHICH IS OF MORE USE IN MANY FIELDS.
      
      I THINK 8 MP WOULD BE BETTER IN COMPARE TO PRICE OF THE PHONE, THAT WHAT TO DAYS MARKET TELLS US."
Xperia U,3,"NO DOUBT THE SPEC SHEET IS SPLENDID AND IF U WANT A DUAL-CORE POWERHOUSE, THINK NO MORE. I USE IPAD2 (DUAL CORE) AND DUAL CORE IS MUCH BETTER THAN SINGLE CORE. BUT, PLEASE, ALSO READ REVIEWS FROM THE CERTIFIED USERS. A PHONE SHOULD FIRST SERVE ITS PRIME PURPOSE, THEN THE REST. ALSO, FOR A BETTER CAMERA EXPERIENCE XPERIA RAY AND XPERIA PRO WITH XMOR SENSORS ARE GOOD VFM HANDSETS. THIS PHONE HAS A VERY POOR CAMERA. PEOPLE WHO HAVE THICKER FINGERS WILL BE UNABLE TO TYPE ON THIS SMALL 3.5 IN SCREEN. BELIEVE ME, I FIND TYPING ON XPERIA NEO V A TAD DIFFICULT WHICH IN CONTRAST BOASTS A 3.7 SCREEN."
Xperia U,3,"NOW I DON'T THINK I NEED TO POINT OUT THE OBVIOUS BUT ANYWAY THIS PHONE HAS EVERYTHING BUT NOTHING
      
      THE DUAL CORE PROCESSOR AND DECENT AMOUNT OF RAM CAN AVAIL GREAT FUNCTIONS BUT THE LIMITED MEMORY RENDERS THE ADVANTAGES MENTIONED ABOVE USELESS ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A SONG LOVER OR ESPECIALLY A DROID GAMER SINCE MOST OF THE HD GAMES IN THE MARKET ARE 512MB ABOVE LIKE HAWX AND GTA 3 SO DON'T GO FOR IT IF YOU WILL BE PLAYING HD GAMES OR LISTENING TO SONGS AND WATCHING MOVIES."
Xperia U,3,"SO , I BOUGHT THIS PHONE  .. I LIKED THE DISPLAY FOR THE PHONE . ITS QUITE CLEAR AND CRISP . THE SPEAKERS ARE GOOD TOO . SOUNDS GOOD IN THE EARPHONES TOO . FOR MEMORY CONSCIOUS PEOPLE THEY CAN CONNECT A OTG CABLE TO IT AND USE A 16-32-64 GB PENDRIVE WITH IT . IT HAS EXCHANGEABLE BOTTOM CAPS WHICH COME IN 4 COLORS RED , YELLOW , WHITE AND BLACK . THE TRANSPARENT STRIP WHICH CHANGES COLOR ALONG WITH THE BOTTOM CAPS ARE TRUELY EYE CATCHERS (SPECIALLY FOR PPL LIKE ME WHO LIKE FUNKY STUFF).
      
      ITS FAST , NICE VIDEO QUALITY(VERY NICE INDEED) , GOOD FOR THE INTERNET USE , WIFI HOTSPOT FEATURE IS EXCELLENT TOO , SOUNDS GOOD , AVERAGE BATTERY  LIFE (8 HOURS WITH EXCESSIVE USE , 1 DAY STANDBY) , OTG FEATURE (AWESOME !!) ,
      
      
      THE ONLY THING THAT WORRIES ME IS THE CAMERA . ITS GOOD IN THE DAYLIGHT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO LOW LIGHT AREAS , THE PICTURES START APPEARING TO BE FOGGY AND BLURRY .. SO AFTER 8-9 DAYS OF EXCESSIVE USAGE I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH ITS CAMERA AS COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES (SAMSUNG , NOKIA , EVEN THE CHEAPER MODELS ) . ANYONE ELSE HAVING THIS PROBLEM OR AM I DOING ANYTHING WRONG ?? O_O
      
      
      OVERALL - 3 1/2 OUT OF 5 STARS ."
Xperia U,3,"SONY PROVIDED MALI-400 GRAPHICS FOR THIS 16K RANGE, THT BRILLIANT....BUT WITH 4GB MEMORY WATS THE USE OF MALI-400...THESE DAYS ALL HD GAMES ARE AROUND 1.5GB OR MORE...SO 4GB IS NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH!!! THE SD FILES CAN OLY BE STORED IN THE PHONE, SO OTG IS NOT GONNA HELP HERE...SO IF U R BUYING THIS FOR GAMING DONT BUY THIS!!! GALAXY S ADVANCE IS THE BETTER CHOICE"
Xperia U,3,"SPECIFICATIONS ARE AWESOME, BUT THE BODY BUILT OF PHONE IS NOT GOOD. ONE WILL NOT EXPECT SUCH A PHONE @ 16K. GO FOR ""NEO V"", IF BODY BUILT MATTERS TO YOU! DUAL CORE WAS NOT NECESSARY AS ITS BATTERY WILL QUICKLY DRAIN DOWN, WHICH IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IF YOUR OWNING A ""SMART"" MULTIMEDIA PHONE :)"
Xperia U,3,"SUPPOSE U HAVE HEFTY BANK BALANCE BUT THERE IS A CLAUSE THAT U CANT SPENT MONEY... HOW WOULD BE YOUR FEELING?? THIS PHONE IS LIKE THIS. IT HAS GOT AWESOME LOOKS, SPECTACULAR SPECS EXCEPT THE MEMORY DEPARTMENT. IF YOU ONE OF THOSE WHO BUY A SMARTPHONE JUST TO TELL OTHERS,THEN IT WONT BOTHER YOU.BUT IF YOU ARE A TRUE SMARTPHONE USER, THEN 4GB IS NEGLIGIBLE... THERE ARE FEW MORONS WHO BELIEVE THAT 4GB IS ENOUGH!! LOL... IF YOU LOAD FEW HD GAMES, IT WILL EXCEED 4GB MEMORY. MY MUSIC COLLECTION IS ALONE APPROX 4.8GB.. EVEN A NON HD RESOLUTION MOVIE IS 700MB..A SYGIC GPS MAP SIZE OVER 1.8GB... WHATS THE USE OF A SMARTPHONE IF YOU CANT USE IT FOR WATCHING MOVIES... CARRY YOUR WHOLE MUSIC COLLECTION... OR PLAY HD GAMES ALL AT ONCE??"
Xperia U,3,"THE PHONE AS A WHOLE IS NOT AS QUICK AS ONE WILL EXPECT IT TO BE WITH THE SPECS DISPLAYED, BUT DOES THE JOB. THE PRICE IS JUSTIFIED BY THE SUPERIOR DISPLAY RESOLUTION IN PAR WITH 20~25K RANGE PHONES, THE WORKING IS IN PAR WITH 7~11K RANGE PHONES.
      
      
      THE BUYING EXPERIENCE IN FLIPKART IS AS USUAL THE BEST."
Xperia U,3,"THE PHONE IS NOT WORTH FOR THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. THE BATTERY IS NOT GOOD , THE SOUND IS VERY VERY LESS, THE SCREEN WIDTH IS LESS EVEN THE CABLE LENGTH IS SMALL  ONLY THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT IS BIG THE CAMERA IS NOT BAD  THE TOUCH WE CANT IS NOT VERY GOOD DONT GO FOR IT"
Xperia U,3,"THE PHONE IS VERY FAST THANKS TO DUAL CORE BUT VOLUME IS PRETTY LOW ,DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS XLOUD FOR, ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT IT DOESN'T COME WITH PREINSTALLED GAMES AND APPS WHICH IS REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR OFFLINE USERS. LASTLY THE ACCESSORIES ARE REALLY CHEAP, RINGO HEADSET COMES FROM THE BOX REALLY LOOKS PREHISTORIC, CHARGING CABLE IS REALLY SHORT"
Xperia U,3,THERE IS NO VIDEO CALLING OPTION IN THE PHONE. STRANGE FOR A DUAL CAMERA 3G PHONE.HOPING TO GET A UPDATE FOR THIS FEATURE IN THIS PHONE. VOLUME OF THE PHONE IS NOT ALSO THAT GOOD. OTHERWISE ALL THE OTHER FEATURES ARE GOOD. WOULD RECOMMEND IF YOU DO NOT PLAN TO USE VIDEO CALL IN FUTURE.
Xperia U,3,"THIS MOBILE IS GOOD COMPARED TO XPERIA P, SOLA MOBILES IN TERMS OF FEATURES &AMP; DESIGN.
      
      IT IS MISSING RATING POINTS BECAUSE OF FEW ISSUES,
      
      1. 4GB USER MEMORY:
      
      SOMEONE CAN ARGUE THAT 4GB MEMORY IS SUFFICIENT. BUT GIVEN WITH HD RECORDING/DISPLAY FEATURES, USER CANNOT RESIST HIMSELF IN VIEWING/RECORDING/STORING HD VIDEOS. YOU CANNOT DEFEND THIS DRAWBACK SAYING 'MERE PAAS EXT HDD HAI'.
      
      2. BATTERY:
      
      BATTERY STANDBY TIME IS VERY LESS COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES (WT19I).
      
      3. VALUE FOR MONEY:
      
      JUST COMPARE XPERIA U WITH WT19I. YOU WILL GET THE FEELING THAT WHETHER DUALCORE + DESIGN WORTH MORE THAN 4000RS?
      
      BUT COMPARED TO OTHER DUAL CORE MOBILES WITH ANDROID OS, THIS MOBILE IS WORTH.
      
      
      ONLY BECAUSE OF MEMORY DRAWBACK, I'M RESISTING MYSELF IN BUYING THIS MOBILE."
Xperia U,3,"THIS PHONE INDEED IS A GOOD ONE IN MANY AREAS. BUT ONE HAVE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING A SONY MOBILE. THE SAR VALUE IS FAR HIGH FOR THIS ONE. SAR INDICATES THE RADIATION PRODUCED BY THE PHONE. SAMSUNG IS GOOD IN THIS AREA. YOU CAN COMPARE THE VALUES IN FLIPKART ITSELF. PLS BE AWARE ABOUT HEALTH TOO....
      
      NOTHING WRONG WITH BUYING THIS ONE IF YOU CAN TAKE SOME PRECAUTIONS LIKE HEADSET ETC...."
Xperia U,3,"VERY NICE PHONE.. AWESOME.. HAVE IT..

      CAMERA BUTTON NOT WORKING
      
      STUCK EVERY TIME AFTER CLOSING THE APP
      
      COULD NOT SWITCH OFF THE TRANSPARENT LIGHT"
Xperia U,3,"WOW! THAT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH WHEN I SAW THIS PHONE BUT THEN NO EXTERNAL MEMORY SUPPORT?! DUH!
      
      NOW IF I SEE IT PRACTICALLY I DON'T KNOW WHY TO BUY THIS PHONE SINCE I HAVE NO WAY TO PUT THIS BEAST TO GOOD USE! THE 1GHZ DUAL CORE AND MALI400 GPU IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE BEST USED IN THOSE AWESOME 3D GAMES BUT THOSE ARE AT AN AVERAGE 1.3GB EACH!! AT PRESENT I OWN A DEFY PLUS WITH CM9(ICS) AND 16GB CARD WHICH IS FULL TO THE BRIM WITH GAMES AND MUSIC! SO IN CASE ONE IS NOT A POWER USER AND IS CONTENT WITH OCCASIONAL HD CONTENT PLAYBACK, DAY TO DAY USE; ITS A GREAT PHONE! BUT IF YOU ARE BUYING AN ANDROID PHONE TO MAKE FULL USE OF ITS POWER THEN THIS IS A DEFINITE NO NO!!"
Xperia U,3,"XPERIA SOLA IS BETTER :)
      
      
      NO BACK CURED BODY AS XPERIA U (SOLA IS SLIMMER )
      
      LITTLE BIGGER DISPLAY :)
      
      BOTH HAVE 5MP CAM...BELIVE ME THY R NOT SAME SOLA HAVE BETTER CAMERA
      
      AND EXPANDABLE MEMORY :) FOR MUSIC AND HD VIDEOS"
Xperia U,2,"1&GT; NO SD CARD SLOT (FOR A YOUTH ORIENTED MOBILE) BIGGEST JOKE OF 2012
      
      2&GT; PROCESSOR HAS THE POWER TO RUN HD VIDEOS BUT NO SPACE TO STORE THEM....TODAYS YOUTH ARE A HD GENERATION!
      
      3&GT; BATTERY 1320MAH BATTERY FOR A DUAL-CORE...SONY SAY NOVATHOR IS 40% MORE POWER EFFICIENT THAN OTHER SOC'S...BUT ITS YET TO BE PROVED ..WAIT FOR THE REVIEWS ON BATTERY BEFORE YOU BUY IT!
      
      4&GT;CLOUD STORAGE IS NT EFFICIENT IN INDIA...ONLY GOOD IF YOU HAV A GOOD WI-FI CONNECTION (AND AS THIS MOBILE IS BUDGET EFFICIENT DEVICE I DOUBT HOW MANY ARE GOING TO USE COSTLY 3G CONNECTIONS?)
      
      5&GT;USING A PEN-DRIVE FOR STORAGE REQUIRES MORE BATTERY..:(
      
      6&GT;USB ON THE GO WORKS ONLY IF THE PHONE HAS A MICRO USB A RECEPTACLE, WHICH IS A SQUARISH FEMALE MICRO USB IN THE PHONE
      
      7&GT;NO HDMI SUPPORT
      
      8&GT;YOU GET CHEAP HEADPHONES NT EVEN IN-EAR
      
      9&GT;THEY CAN GIVE FEATURES LIKE 4 FINGERS MULTITOUCH SUPPORT BUT NOT A SD CARD?
      
      10&GT;DONT JUST GO FOR IT BCOZ IT HAS A DUAL-CORE AT 16K-17K PRICE POINT!
      
      11&GT; SONY SERIOUSLY SUCKED WITH THIS N ARE TRYING TO SELL IT CHEAPER DNT FALL FOR IT...GO FOR OTHER BETTER MOBILES!
      
      CONCLUSION - DONT FALL FOR LOOKS AND LOW PRICE...IT LACKS SOME OF THE BASIC AND MST IMP FEATURES (BATTERY AND MEMORY)..,PLZ KEEP THAT IN MIND BEFORE U GO FOR IT!"
Xperia U,2,BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS NOT GOOD IF YOU ARE USING APPS THEN IT'S HARDLY WORK FOR AN HOUR IF U ARE ONLY USE FOR TALK THEN IT'S BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS HARDLY TWO HOURS SO IF U WANT TO PURCHASE IT THINK TWICE :(
Xperia U,2,"DEAR BUYERS OUT THERE YOU MIGHT BE HAPPY WITH THE FEATURES THAT THE PHONE PROVIDES AT THIS COST BUT WHAT MOST OF ARE NEGLECTING IS THE SAR VALUE OF THE PHONE.. ITS 1.62 W/KG.. THAT'S QUITE A CONCERN FELLOWS. THIS PHONE IS A SILENT KILLER. THINK BEFORE YOU BUY. KINDLY GO FOR PHONES WITH SAR RATINGS BELOW 0.9 W/KG. I HOPE THIS HELPS.
      
      
      REGARDS"
Xperia U,2,DON'T GO FOR THIS PHONE..THE SCREEN IS VERY FRAGILE..MY SCREEN GOT BROKEN AND IT COSTS 4800RS(+TAX) FOR REPLACING IT..WARRANTY DOESN'T COVER PHYSICAL DAMAGE..AFTER ICS UPDATE THE PHONE IS VERY LAG ALL THE TIME..512MB IS NOT ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR...

      GO FR OTHER XPERIA .... DON'T MOVE TO XPERIA U ..."
Xperia U,2,"I BOUGHT SONY XPERIA U ON FLIPCART ON 12.12.2012. BATTERY IS DRAINING SO SOON AND I NEED TO CHARGE TWICE A DAY AND VOLUME IS LOWER I.E., WEN I USE TO TRAVEL I CANT EVEN HEAR MY PHONE RINGING AND WHEN I PLAY MUSIC IT WAS NOT LOUDER TOO.CANT ABLE TO USE CAMERA AT NIGHT EVERY PHOTOS TAKEN AT NIGHT SEEMS MISTY..OUTDOOR PHOTOS SEEMS GOOD BUT FEW PHOTOS LOOKS GRAINY."
Xperia U,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 3 DAYS BACK. THERE ARE A LOT OF REVIEWS ON THE INTERNET PRAISING THE VARIOUS FEATURES OF THIS PHONE. HERE IS A LIST OF CONS :
      
      1. PATHETIC CALL AUDIO (VERY LOW)
      
      2. VERY LOW RINGTONE VOLUME.
      
      3. VERY POOR VIDEO QUALITY DESPITE 720P VIDEO
      
      4. ERRATIC OTG FUNCTION (I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT ONLY 2 OUT OF 10 PEN DRIVES.
      
      5. WIDTH OF THE SCREEN IS SMALL.
      
      MY VERDICT - DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE AS THE BASIC FUNTIONS OF THIS PHONE ARE PATHETIC. ALSO THE WHOLE OF XPERIA SERIES (XPERIA U, P SOLA, S) HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM."
Xperia U,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AROUND 6 MONTHS AGO AND I MUST ADMIT, I WAS HAPPY CUSTOMER FOR FEW COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THEN IT STARTED SHOWING ME PROBLEMS. FIRST THING I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SUDDEN PRICE DROP WITHIN 1ST MONTH AFTER THE PURCHASE....I WISH WE HAD PRICE GUARANTEE OPTIONS IN INDIA :-)
      
      
      BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS HANDSET IS ITS SPEED, EVEN THOUGH THEY MENTIONED IT A DUO -CORE HOWEVER IT IS VERY-2 SLOW. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAUSED ANYTHING TO THE PHONE TO ACT LIKE A SLOW SNAIL HOWEVER I HAVE BARE MINIMUM APPLICATIONS RUNNING ON THE PHONE. I HAVE THE LATEST FW, I ALWAYS KILL UNWANTED TASKS RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND HOWEVER STILL THE SAME ISSUE. SOMETIME AFTER I PRESS THE PHONE BUTTON TO MAKE A CALL, MY SCREEN JUST SIT THERE FOR 3-5 SECONDS AND SOMETIME EVEN 10 SECOND AND THEN MY PHONE DIRECTORY COME UP. NOT SURE IF SOMEONE ELSE IS ALSO EXP THIS ISSUE WITH THIS PHONE.
      
      
      
      I BELIEVE THIS IS THE WAY IT IS GOING TO BE. WOULD'VE GIVEN IT 4 BUT NOW AS I SPENT GOOD AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THIS PHONE SO I WILL RATE IT AT 2 MAX.
      
      
      POTENTIAL BUYERS CAN LOOK FOR OTHER OPTIONS LIKE IPHONE 4 MODEL AVAILABLE IN MKT AROUND 23K. I PROMISE YOU , YOU WON'T REGRET YOUR DECESION
      
      
      REST OF YOU,,, ALL THE BEST"
Xperia U,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON FIRST DAY ITSELF...REALLY NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS..AS MANY REVIEWS HAVE  GIVEN YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MEMORY(NO SD SLOT,ONLY 4 GB USER ACCESSIBLE) I WONT DISCUSS MUCH REGARDING THIS... APART FROM THIS PROS AND CONS OF THIS MODEL IS..
      
      
      PROS:
      
      
      1 DUAL CORE PROCESSOR IS FAST AND SATISFACTORY. I HAVE INSTALLED MANY APPS IN MY MOBILE BUT DID NOT STUCK
      
      
      2 THIS MOBILE HAS SONY 3D SURROUND SOUND AUDIO TECHNOLOGY...(NOT ALL HANDSETS PROVIDE THIS)AND MUSIC LOVERS, YOU NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT BATTERY...IT DOES NOT CONSUMES MUCH
      
      
      3 BRAVIA ENGINE DISPLAY IS REALLY GOOD...AND EVERY ONE WILL LIKE THIS
      
      
      4 LESS WEIGHT,SLIM PHONE WITH 3.5 INCH SCREEN LOOKS GOOD AND EASY TO CARRY
      
      
      CONS:
      
      I THINK I HAVE MOST NEGATIVES WHEN COMPARED WITH PROS
      
      
      1 BRAVIA ENGINE DISPLAY,280 PPI(PIXEL PER INCH) AND SCRATCH LESS SCREEN IS REALLY GOOD...BUT HOW CAN HE GIVE JUST 1300MAH..I THINK FOR THIS MOBILE 1600MAH WILL BE SUITABLE...
      
      
      2 CAMERA IS HAVING FLASH AND GUYS REMEMBER THAT THE CLARITY WILL BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE SUNLIGHT..SNAPS IN NIGHT MODE ARE JUST AVERAGE
      
      
      3 SONY MOBILES ARE GOOD FOR MUSIC...BUT HERE THE HEADPHONES SUCKS...
      
      
      4 SORRY TO SAY..SOMETIMES EVEN BLUE TOOTH GIVES PROBLEM(IN MINOR CASES)
      
      
      5 HAPPY TO SEE USB ON THE GO SUPPORT TO THIS...BUT IT CONSUMES BATTERY TOO MUCH
      
      
      6 LEAVE ABOUT SURFING NET IN 3G...EVEN IF YOU JUST PLAY ORDINARY GAMES CHARGE WILL COME DOWN...OF COURSE IT GETS HEATED UP BIT
      
      
      IF ANY ONE ASK ME TO GIVE ONE LINE REVIEW ABOUT THIS MOBILE...I CAN TELL THAT GUYS WHO ARE READY TO COMPROMISE FOR MEMORY AND BATTERY....THIS IS THE BEST MOBILE IN MARKET"
Xperia U,2,"I DON'T KNOW WHY SONY IS LOWERING THE QUALITY OF ITS PRODUCTS DAY BY DAY..MADE FROM A VERY CHEAP PLASTIC(RECYCLED ONE)N U WILL GET TO KNW DAT ONLY AFTER FEW DAYS OF USE,FIRST IMPRESSION IS GOOD THOUGH PHONE IS KINDA SMALL..I THOUGHT I'LL SURVIVE WITH 4 GB INTERNAL MEMORY(USER ACCESSIBLE) + 2GB FOR APPS,BUT GUYS SERIOUSLY,THIS LIMITS U FROM HAVING A TRUE ANDROID EXPERIENCE..MUSIC QUALITY DISAPPOINTS,NEITHER VOLUME NOR QUALITY THOUGH THE DEFAULT MUSIC PLAYER APP IS GOOD..AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST FLAWS IS ITS CAMERA..I HAVE NVR SEEN A WORST CAMERA IN ANY PHNE ABOVE 10 K,IN FACT SOME OF THE HTC,SAMSUNG N NOKIA PHONES BELOW 10K ARE FAR FAR BETTER THAN SONY XPERIA U'S 5MP CAMERA WITH A FLASH..I DOUBT IF ITS REALLY A 5 MP CAMERA..BESIDES THAT U CANT SHOOT IN 16:9 MODE WITH 5 MP RESOLUTION..I WISH I COULD GO BACK N CHANGE MY MIND AND GO FOR ANY THER PHONE AT THIS PRICE..THE ONLY GOOD PART OF A PHONE IS DAT TRANSPARENT BAR AT THE BOTTOM WHICH IS REALLY EYE CATCHING..AND THOUGH U CAN PLAY MOST OF THE GAMES,BUT 4 GB IS A  BIG JOKE COS THESE DAYS MOST OF THE HIGH QUALITY GAMES RANGE BETWEEN 1.5-2 GB..WHAT'S WORST IS THAT NO ICS UPDATE AS OF YET N SONY IS DOING FAKE PROMISES FOR IT,WHICH IS KILLING ME N MANY OTHER USERS..OVERALL I'LL GIVE A 2 STAR TO THIS PHONE FOR ITS GREAT LOOKS AND DUAL CORE PROCESSOR N MALI GPU..!!"
Xperia U,2,"I GOT THIS PHONE ON 27TH DEC AND IT WAS A BEST AND FAST PHONE UNTIL I UPGRADED TO ICS.
      
      AFTER UPGRADING TO ICS PHONE BECOME SO SLOW THAT I CANNOT EVEN PICK UP THE CALL WHEN SOME ONE CALLS THE PHONE VIBRATES AND NOTIFICATION LIGHT BLINKS BUT SCREEN IS BLANK. WHEN I GO IN PHONE TO DIAL DIAL PAD DOES NOT SHOWS UP AND CALLING FROM CALL LOG IS A NIGHTMARE. FOR PAST ONE WEEK MY PHONE IS IN SONY SERVICE CENTER FOR MOTHERBOARD REPLACEMENT.
      
      
      IF YOU DONT MIND GETTING STUCK IN GINGERBREAD THIS THIS IS BEST PHONE FOR YOU.
      
      PROS (UNDER GINGERBREAD)
      
      1) SMOOTH AND FAST SPEED
      
      2) ULTRAFAST CHARGING
      
      3) LONG BATTERY LIFE
      
      4) CLEAR CAMERA
      
      5) CRISP AND CLEAR SCREEN
      
      
      CONS (ICS)
      
      1) HEAVY RAM CONSUMPTION EVEN IF THERE IS NO MULTITASKING OR BACKGROUND APPLICATIONS RUNNING
      
      2) LAGGING PERFORMANCE
      
      3) YOU ARE FORTUNATE IF YOU CAN ANSWER THE DIAL A CALL.
      
      4) WHEN DATA CONNECTION IS TURNED ON PHONE FREEZES AS IF ALL THE APPS ARE TRYING TO ACCESS NET!"
Xperia U,2,"I HAVE SEEN BOTH THE PHONES N SONY HANGS LIKE CRAZY
      
      IF U WANT TO TAKE A PEICE AT THAT RANGE GO FOR HTC ONE V, ITS FLUENT FAST N HAS BETTER CAMERA N YA MEM Z EXPENDABLE TOO.
      
      IT HAS ONBOARD ICS SO IT TAKES FULL USE OF MULTITASKING WHICH SONY DON'T PROVIDE(2.3)
      
      HTC HAS BEATS AUDIO WHICH IS BEST OUT THERE, IT ALSO PROVIDE A DIFF CHIP FOR CAMERA WHICH TAKE BRIGHT, CRISP IMAGES THAT TOO AT BLAZING FAST SPEED, THE BURST MODE IS BEST OUT THERE.
      
      N YA ONE LAST THING SENSE 4 THE BEST N BEAUTIFUL THING. XPERIA U TIMESSCAPE IS NOTHING FRONT OF IT"
Xperia U,2,"IT HAS BEEN JUST OVER 4 MONTHS SINCE I BOUGHT THIS PHONE.EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.SUPER SMOOTH TOUCH,AWESOME CAMERA,BRILLIANT DISPLAY AND POWERFULL PERFORMANCE..

Xperia U,2,PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE THIS PHONE HAS A KNOWN BUG BY WHICH MOST OF THE TIME YOUR PHONE WONT BE REACHABLE... EVEN AFTER UPGRADING TO LATEST VERSION IT IS HAVING THE SAME ISSUE... WHAT IS THE USE OF A PHONE IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE ANY CALLS BUT HAVING ALL OTHER FEATURES......
Xperia U,2,"THE PHONE IS GREAT WHILE USING THE GINGERBREAD OS. BUT THEN SONY HAS RELEASED THE ICS UPDATE AND ONCE I UPDATED THE OS TO ICS, THE PHONE BECAME VERY SLOW AND IT SEEMS THE XPERIA U HARDWARE CANT HANDLE THE ICS. YOU CAN SEARCH ONLINE AND YOU WILL FIND LOTS OF INFORMATION ON THIS. IF THE PHONE CANT HANDLE THE UPGRADED OS, WHY WOULD SONY RELEASE AN UPDATE. I USED TO BE A SONY FAN BUT PRODUCTS LIKE THESE FROM SONY ARE DISAPPOINTING. ONCE THE UPGRADE IS DONE THERE IS NO GOING BACK TO GINGERBREAD. EITHER WE HAVE TO FLASH THE OS WHICH WILL VOID THE WARRANTY OR HAVE TO TAKE IT TO THE SONY SERVICE CENTER"
Xperia U,2,"THIS IS A GOOD PHONE OVERALL. BUT BE WARNED, THE GLASS IS EXTREMELY FRAGILE. I ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED MY PHONE FROM A HEIGHT OF ABOUT 3.5 FEET AND THE GLASS SHATTERED. THE SERVICE CENTER IS CHARGING 4500/- TO FIX IT."
Xperia U,2,"THIS IS REALLY A GOOD PRODUCT BY SONY.I AM PLANNING TO BUY THIS PHONE RECENTLY..THE ONLY THING I AM CONFUSED ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE INTERNAL MEMORY..SOME USERS SAYS ITS 4GB OTHERS SAY ITS 8GB..SO,A LITTLE CONFUSED. CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHAT IS THE TOTAL MEMORY AVAILABLE FOR THE USERS..?????"
Xperia U,2,THIS PHONE IS A COMPLETE DISASTER BY SONY. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SHOW STEALER BUT DUE TO ITS LACK OF MEMORY CARD I DONT THINK THIS PHONE IS WORTH ANYTHING. I MEAN SERIOSULY WHO IS GOING TO BUY A PHONE FOR 17K WITH 4GB MEMORY.4GB IS WAY TOO LESS. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ATLEAST 8 OR 16. THE ILLUMINATING STRIP WAS AN AWESOME CONCEPT BUT MEMORY DESTROYS THE CHARM OF THE HANDSET.
Xperia U,2,"USED THIS FONE FOR 1 MONTH WITH 2.3 .IT IS GUD BUT AFTER UPDATING ICS ITS NO USE PHONE
      
      ITS SHOWS MANY DAMN PROBLEMS

      2. HOME SCREEN IS UNABLE TO LOAD AS I RETURN BACK FROM
      
      APPLICATIONS.IT GIVES MESSAGE ""XPERIA HOME FAILED TO LOAD"".
      
      3. IF THE SCREEN IS LOCKED INCOMING CALLS SELDOM FAIL TO BE
      
      DISPLAYED FOR PICKING UP, SO U GOT NOTHING TO DO JUST LISTEN
      
      TO IT RINGING :/
      
      4. THE WORST MESSAGE NOTIFICATION TONE IS SIMPLY ""ABSENT"".
      
      5. MY INTEGRATED FACEBOOK IS NEVER ABLE TO LOG IN.
      
      
      PERFORMANCE IS CLEARLY ""VISIBLY"" DEGRADED TO A BIG EXTENT.
      
      
      PROS OF ICS.
      
      DESPITE OF ISSUES WITH ICS, THERE WERE SOME GOOD THINGS THAT
      
      CAME WITH UPGRADE.
      
      
      1. GOOGLE CHROME BROWSER.
      
      2. NICE NEW UNLOCK PATTERN SCREEN
      
      3. BEAUTIFUL WALKMAN VISUALIZATIONS
      
      4. NICE ALBUM PRESENTATION.
      
      5. EASY TASK MANAGER TO KILL APPLICATIONS
      
      6. IN BUILT DATA USAGE COUNTER.
      
      
      
      IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PHONE WHICH WILL NOT MAKE U WAIT FOR
      
      EVERY SMALL TASK THEN DON'T INCLUDE IT IN YOUR LIST, JUST
      
      PROCESSOR DOESN'T DECIDE EVERY ASPECT OF PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      AND JUST FOR HYPE ABOUT THE CAMERA, IT IS USELESS. BEST PICTURE
      
      U GET ONLY FOR NATURAL LIGHTING AND IF YOU ZOOM IT U JUST GET
      
      ONE WORD OUT OF YOUR MOUTH AND U KNW IT ;)
      
      
      WAS USING A BLACKBERRY PREVIOUSLY,NEVER MADE ME WAIT :/.
      
      HUH.. SEEMS LIKE TIME TO SWITCH BACK..
      
      
      HAPPY PHONE SEARCHING!!"
Xperia U,1,"BOUGHT THIS CRAP 7 DAYS AGO FROM A RETAILER.FROM THE 2ND DAY ITSELF IT SHOWED PROBLEMS.
      
      1.CAN'T USE FOR MORE THAN 30 MINS CONTINUOUSLY. IT WILL HEAT UP LIKE A HOT PLATE.
      
      2.CAMERA QUALITY IS GOOD IF U SEE IT  ON THE PHONE SCREEN.TRANSFER IT TO A PC AND U WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.
      
      3.THE MOST IRRITATING THING IS THE SPEAKER LOUDNESS.....IT'S JUST #*#*~#*#~!!$@*.WHILE PLAYING MUSIC @ FULL VOLUME,U CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN U R 3-4 FT  AWAY FROM THE PHONE.ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS SPEAKER!
      
      4.FINALLY RAM.ONLY 368 MB OF IT IS AVAILABLE NOT 512 MB.THAT TOO WILL BE DECREASED TO 30-40 MB WHILE RUNNING 1-2 APPS IN THE BACKGROUND.
      
      MY HUMBLE REQUEST TO ALL FRIENDS WHO R THINKING TO BUY THIS PHONE IS THAT,PLEAAAASE
      
      DON'T BUY THIS TOY.I MADE BIG MISTAKE BY BUYING IT."
Xperia U,1,"BROUGTH THIS PHONE IN SEPT '12. EARLIER IT HAD STARTED GIVING BATTERY ISSUE AS I AM WORKING IN SALES N MARKETING SO BATTERY BACKUP IS OPTIMUM IMPORTANT FOR ME, BUT I NEED TO CHARGE BATTERY FOR ALMOST 2-3 TIMES A DAY,
      
      I THOUGHT IT WAS BECASUSE OF GINGERBIRD 2.3 SO I VISITED SONY SERVICE CENTER, POOR PEOPLE FROM SERVICE CENTER WAS NOT AWARE ABOUT V4 VERSION FOR EXPERIA U &AMP; SO REQUESTED ME TO DO IT ONLINE, AFTER INSTALLING V4 STILL THE PROBLEM PERSIST OF BATTERY ISSUE... PHONE KEEPS HANGING INBETWEEN,
      
      AGAIN VISITED SERVICE CENTER THEN THEY HAVE REINSTALL V2.3, AFTER RECEIVING THE SAME THEN NEW PROBLEM ARRISE, IE. CALL GETS DISCONNECTED ABRUPTLY, EVEN IF FULL NETWORK RANGE IS THERE, COMPLETE DISSAPOINTMENT,
      
      VERY POOR PERFORMANCE, PL AVOID,
      
      
      ONLY ONE GOOD THING FOR THIS PHONE IS OTG (U CAN CONNECT USB TO THE PHONE USING CABLE)"
Xperia U,1,"DONT BUY THIS PHONE.... BATTERY IS TOTAL WASTE... CANT CLICK MORE THAN 20 PHOTOS(USING FLASH) EVEN AFTER FULL RECHARGE. YOU MAY NEED TO RECHARGE THIS BATTERY FOR MORE THAN 3 TIMES IN A DAY, IF YOU USE THIS PHONE OTHER THAN CALLING LIKE MUSIC, CAMERA, GAMES... THIS PHONE HAS ALL THE FEATURES, BUT YOU CANT ENJOY IT BECAUSE OF THIS WASTE BATTERY.... THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS MOBILE....."
Xperia U,1,"EXTREMELY BAD, SUB-STANDARD PRODUCT. DON'T BUY IT!!! I BOUGHT ONE IN JUNE 2012. IN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS THE TOUCH SCREEN STARTED BECOMING UNRESPONSIVE. HAVE TO SWIPE / TOUCH 5 - 10 TIMES IN DIFFERENT ANGLES AND WITH DIFFERENT PRESSURES TO GET IT TO RESPOND. SOMETIMES EVEN THAT DOESN'T WORK.
      
      I AM UNABLE TO RECEIVE CALLS AS THE AREA OF THE TOUCH SCREEN THAT I NEED TO TOUCH TO RECEIVE THEM IS NOT WORKING. CANNOT TYPE CERTAIN LETTERS DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE ON THE SCREEN. USING THE PHONE HAS BECOME AN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.
      
      THE SUPPORT FROM SONY IS EXTREMELY POOR. CALLED THEIR SUPPORT WHO INFORMED ME TO 'REPAIR' THE SOFTWARE USING SONY COMPANION ON MY COMP. THAT NEVER SEEMS TO WORK. I'VE BEEN SPENDING DAYS TRYING TO DOWNLOAD THE RELEVANT FILES TO CARRY OUT THE REPAIRS AND ALWAYS GET SOME OR THE OTHER ERROR MESSAGE AFTER HOURS OF WAITING FOR THE DOWNLOAD TO COMPLETE.
      
      
      ADVISE OF A CUSTOMER WHO BURNT HIS FINGERS ON IT - NEVER BUY THIS PHONE."
Xperia U,1,FROM THE DAY 1 I HAVE A TROUBLE WITH THIS PHONE(XPERIA U) IT ALWAYS GETS HANG. TOUCH DOESNT WORK PROPERLY. POOR BATTERY BACKUP. FINALLY NOT HAPPY WITH PHONE WAST OF MONEY. IF SONY IS READY TO REPLACE THIS PRODUCT IAM HAPPY TO DO IT SO QUICKLY. IAM A SONY USER FROM PAST BUT THIS PHONE MADE ME UNHAPPY AND CANT SUGGEST TO SOMEONE EVEN.
Xperia U,1,"HI ALL!
      
      
      THIS IS THE WORST PHONE I'VE EVER HAD. THIS IS MY FIRST SMARTPHONE AND I REGRET I DID NOT GO FOR SAMSUNG WHICH IS A TRUSTED NAME FOR ANDROID PHONES. SILLY ME I JUST WANTED TO GET A DIFFERENT BAD, WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.
      
      
      DON'T GET SOLD ON THE DUAL CORE BULLSHIT, THIS PHONE IS SLOWER THAN A TURTLE FUCK. IF YOU KEEP YOUR WIFI OR DATA CONNECTION ON THEN THE PHONE WILL SIMPLY FREEZE. I GIFTED MY WIFE A SAMSUNG GALAXY Y ON HER BIRTHDAY AND EVEN THAT WORKS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS AWFUL PIECE OF SHIT.
      
      
      THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT EXPAND THE ABYSMAL 8GB MEMORY IS A BIG MINUS TOO.
      
      
      WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF BUYING THIS PHONE I HAD TO SEND IT TO THE SERVICE CENTER AS THE TOUCH SCREEN HAD DIED A SLOW DEATH. FIRST A SMALL PORTION OF THE TOP LEFT CORNER HAD BECOME UNRESPONSIVE AND I USED TO ROTATE THE SCREEN JUST TO HIT THE RIGHT BUTTONS. THEN IN NO TIME IT SPREAD LIKE A CANCER AND THE PHONE WAS F****G USELESS. SINCE THE PHONE WAS WITHIN WARRANTY THE SERVICE CENTER REPLACED IT BUT ONLY AFTER 15 DAYS. THIS PLACE IS LIKE 20 KMS AWAY FROM WHERE I LIVE. BLOODY NIGHTMARE.
      
      
      WENT BACK TO MY OLD NOKIA 5800 UNTIL THE PHONE WAS GETTING REPAIRED AND REALISED HOW MUCH I HAD MISSED IT, SO MUCH SO THAT I CONTINUED USING IT FOR 2 WEEKS EVEN AFTER I HAD COLLECTED THE SONY XPIRED U F***K-TART FROM THE SERVICE CENTER.
      
      
      EVERY TIME AN APP ON THIS GOOD-FOR-NOTHING PHONE CRASHES MY HEART SKIPS A BEAT. JUST YOURSELF THE NIGHTMARE GUYS GO FOR TRUSTED NAMES LIKE SAMSUNG IF YOU WANT ANDROID, NOKIA IF YOU WANT WINDOWS 8 OR IPHONE. THIS PHONE IS SO BAD THAT SONY SHOULD ACTUALLY RECALL IT AND COMPENSATE PEOPLE FOR THE AGONY THEIR PRODUCT HAS CAUSED."
Xperia U,1,"I AM USING THIS PHONE AND IT HANGS VERY VER VERY MUCH!!!
      
      DONT GO FOR IT !! MEMORY ISNT A PROBLEM !! RAM IS THE PROBLEM !!
      
      THEY SAY ITS 512MB BUT ACTUAL  CAPCITY IS 377MB !!!
      
      DONT BUY THIS PLEASE !!! TRUST ME QQQ

      I WUD HAVE GIVEN IT NO STAR IF TGERE WAS AN OPTION LYK DAT"
Xperia U,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON MARCH 2012 AND NOW TOUCHSCREEN IS NOT WORKING. I HAVE SEARCHED IN INTERNET AND FOUND LOT OF USERS HAVE REPORTED SAME ISSUE. IT IS BEING DISCUSSED IN COUPLE OF SONY RELATED BLOGS. ONLY SOLUTION IS GIVE IT BACK TO SERVICE CENTER FOR REPLACING TOUCH SCREEN. EVEN SOME USERS REPORTED ISSUE STILL PERSISTS AFTER REPLACING SCREEN.
      
      ALSO BATTERY BACKUP WILL NOT LAST FOR 12 HOURS IF YOU TURN ON 3G. I AM KEEPING PHONE IN 2G MODE AND DATA CONNECTION IN DISABLED STATE TO SAVE BATTERY.
      
      INITIALLY PHONE WAS VERY GOOD BUT NOW FACING A LOT OF ISSUES. I WILL NEVER BY A PHONE FROM SONY AGAIN."
Xperia U,1,"I BOUGHT THIS THIS PHONE ON 18TH AUGUST.
      
      FRIENDS , LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING THIS SHIT BOASTS OFF THE ""DUAL CORE PROCESSOR""
      
      BUT TRUST ME IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK. GAMES HAVING HIGH END GRAPHICS LIKE ""FIFA 2012"" CAN'T BE PLAYED OVER IT THOUGH IT HAS A SO CALLED HEAVY PROCESSOR. MOREOVER, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WHAT I ENCOUNTERED IN IT WAS WHENEVER I WAS LISTENING TO MUSIC, AND SOMEONE CALLED ME THIS SHIT JUST HANGED UP AND IT HAD TO BE REBOOTED SO AS TO WORK AN THIS PROBLEM PISSED ME OFF EVERY TIME. IT JUST LAGS TO DEATH IF ANY ONE WILL UPGRADE IT TO ICS. TO ME MORE PRECISE , SONY FELL ITS PRICE FOM 16,500 TO JUST 14000 DUE TO ITS WEAK PERFORMANCE.
      
      
      IN MY OPINION DON'T BUY IT, ITS ALL FEATURES ARE A BIG HOAX, OPT FOR XPERIA J IT IS FAR BETTER PHONE THAN IT."
Xperia U,1,"I BROUGHT THIS PHONE AFTER GETTING LURED BY ITS SUPERB SPECS, JUST LIKE MANY OF YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE.
      
      BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS, THE CAMERA STARTED GIVING A PROBLEM- 'ERROR-CAMERA NOT AVAILABLE""....I WAS ADVISED TO DO A SOFTWARE REPAIR...I DID THE SAME, BUT ALL IN VAIN...
      
      NEXT THE SERVICE CENTRE TRIED TO REPAIR THE PHONE..BUT THE SAME PROBLEM POPPED UP AGAIN AFTER A DAY OF USAGE...
      
      THEN I WAS ASKED TO SUBMIT THE HANDSET FOR 15 DAYS...I DID SO..AFTER 15 DAYS, I GOT A HANDSET FROM SONY WHICH HAD SIX MORE DEFECTS IN ADDITION TO THE CAMERA DEFECT WHICH WAS PRESENT EARLIER...I WAS REALLY STUNNED TO SEE MY PHONE'S CONDITION...I HAV AGAINED SUBMITTED MY HANDSET TO SONY'S 'SKILLED' ENGINEERS FOR 15 DAY...DUNNO FROM WHERE SONY HIRES ITS ENGINEERS...BUT I WONT SIT QUIETLY IF MY ISSUES ARE NOT RESOLVED...I WILL GO TO THE CONSUMER COURT FOR SUING SONY...

Xperia U,1,"I HAPPEN TO BUY XPERIA U FROM A LOCAL SHOP IN MUMBAI ON 21/5/2012. TILL 15/6/2012 I WAS VERY MUCH CONVINCED THAT FOR 16500 THERE IS NO OTHER ANDROID PHONE WITH THE TECH SPEC SONY XPERIA U HAD TO OFFER. BUT EVERY DAY  AFTER 15/6/12 , TILL DATE I HAVE BEEN CURSING MYSELF FOR BUYING THIS HANDSET WITHOUT WAITING FOR FEEDBACK AND LIKE OTHERS HAVING BLIND FAITH IN SONY. ON 15 /6/12 WHEN EVER I USED THE PHONE TO TAKE A PHONE A PINKISH PURPLE SPOT APPEARED ON THE SCREEN . THE SPOT USED TO ALSO BE THERE IN THE PHOTO AS WELL. MY FIRST STEP WAS TO GOOGLE AND SEE IF I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ISSUE BUT I CAME ACROSS MANY PEOPLE IN INDIA EHO HAVE THIS CAMERA ISSUE WITH XPERIA U . BUT THIS WAS JUST THE START OF MY AGONY WHAT FOLLOWED LATER WAS WORST. IT TOOK ME 10 MINUTES(WHICH IS NORMAL) TO GET THROUGH SONY CALL CENTER  PEOPLE . THEY GAVE VARIOUS ADDRESS OF THERE CENTERS IN MUMBAI BUT 4 OUT OF FIVE CENTERS DINT BOTHER TO ANSWER THE PHONE . I HAD TO CALL THEM AGAIN , ARGUE WITH THEM TILL ONE OF THERE HIGHER REPRESENTATIVES CALLED THE GHATKOPER CALL CENTER AND TOOK ME ON CONFERENCE AND TOLD THE CALL CENTER GUY TO GIVE ME A NEW PHONE WHEN I REACH THERE. I HAPPENED TO GO THERE A FEW DAYS LATER AND AS EXPECTED THE GUY REFUSED TO RECOGINIZE ME . I COULDNT GET THROUGH THE SAME GUY WHEN I CALLED SONY CALL CENTER AS HE DID NOT GIVE ME HIS PEROSNAL MOBILE NUMBER. THE DERVICE CENTER GUY TOLD ME THAT SONY WILL ONLY REPLACE AND GIVE YOU A NEW PHONE IF YOU EXPERIENCE A PROBLEM WITIN SEVEN DAYS OF PURCHASE . THIS CLAUSE IF HOWEVER NOT PRINTED AND NOR MENTIONED TO ANY CONSUMER WHILE BUYING THE
      
      PHONE.I SUBMITTED THE PHONE ON THE 22ND OF JUNE 2012 WITHOUT THE BOX . THEY TOLD ME TO SUBMIT ONLY THE PHONE AND TOLD ME THE WILL TRY AND GIVE A NEW PHONE OR A REFURBISHED PHONE ( AN USED XPERIA U USED BY SOME ONE ELSE REPAIRED AND BOUT TO WORKING CONDITION ) TO ME . THIS IS A COMMON PRACTICE OF SONY REPAIR CENTERS ( GOOGLE PROBLEMS WITH SONY OFFICAL MOBILE  REPAIR CENTERS AND THE LIST OF TROUBLED AND TORTURED PEOPLE IS ENDLESS) . I AM STILL WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENT PHONE AND WILL POST A FEEDBACK WHEN I RECEIVE IT .
      
      
      I THANK FLIPKART TO HAVE GIVEN CONSUMERS A CHANCE TO GIVE THERE FEEDBACK .
      
      THE ONLY REASON FOR NOT BUYING THIS PHONE VIA FLIPKART WAS BECAUSE I GAVE MY OLD BLACKBERRY IN RETURN PAID SOME MONEY OVER IT AND GOT THIS PHONE, SO I HAD TO USE A LOCAL DEALER TO GET THIS PHONE
      
      APART FROM MOBILE PHONES ALL MY OTHER ELECTRONIC GADGETS HAS AND WILL COME VIA FLIPKART"
Xperia U,1,"I HAVE A BIG FAN OF ALL THE SONY MOBILES, BEEN USING THEIR MOBILES SINCE 8 YRS. THIS PHONE IS A BIG LET DOWN, I HAVE DECIDED TO NEVER AGAIN BUY ANY SONY MOBILE
      
      
      PRO'S
      
      -&GT; VERY COOL LIGHT BAR
      
      -&GT; GOOD UI AND DISPLAY COLORS
      
      -&GT; GREAT SOUND CLARITY AS USUAL FROM SONY
      
      -&GT; VERY HANDY
      
      
      CON'S
      
      -&GT;ICS UPDATE SUCKS, IT DRAINS OUT THE BATTERY LIKE CRAZY AND THE MOBILE HANGS FOREVER
      
      -&GT; BATTERY LASTS ONLY A DAY FOR NORMAL USAGE
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS, IT WORKED WELL INITIALLY BUT AFTER THE ICS UPGRADE, IT BECAME PATHETIC. UNABLE TO TAKE CALLS, IT TAKES MINIMUM 4 SECONDS TO CALL, SAME IS THE CASE WITH CAMERA, PHONE BOOK, GAMES ETC. WAIT FOR A WHILE FOR ANY APP TO LOAD. BEST APP FOR THIS PHONE IS ""CLEAN MASTER"" AT LEAST BOOSTS THE MOBILE FOR 10 SECONDS.
      
      
      I VOWED NEVER TO BUY ANY SONY PHONE AGAIN, FOR FOLKS PLANNING TO BUY THIS PHONE.... BE READY FOR LIFE IN SLOW MOTION."
Xperia U,1,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR THE PAST 5 MONTHS.THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS PHONE IN THE FIRST MONTH WAS GREAT.AFTERWARDS THERE WAS SOME ISSUE IN THE TOUCH SENSITIVITY.WHEN YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC YOU CAN'T ATTEND CALLS AS THE PHONE HANGS.BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH OF A PROBLEM.
      
      THE REAL PROBLEM(S) STARTED AFTER UPDATING TO ICS.
      
      1.TOUCH GOES HAYWIRE
      
      2.APPS THAT RESPONDED TO GB BECOMES SLOW AND UNSTABLE IN ICS
      
      3.PHONE BECOMES SLOW
      
      4.UNABLE TO TYPE(WHEN YOU TYPE G YOU GET H OR F )
      
      5.SOME APPS LIKE MX PLAYER ALWAYS CHANGES THE ASPECT RATIO AUTOMATICALLY WHILE WATCHING A MOVIE.
      
      6.WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE CONTACTS LIST THE PHONE MAKES A RANDOM CALL
      
      
      AND ABOUT THE PHONE
      
      1.THE LOUDSPEAKER IS NOT SO LOUD( XLOUD AND BLAH BLAH ARE JUST MARKETING STRATEGIES)
      
      2THE CAMERA IS GOOD IN OUTDOORS BUT THE FLASH IS REALLY BAD.YOU CAN'T TAKE GOOD PHOTOS WITH FLASH.I THINK THE ONLY USE OF THE CAMERA FLASH IS A GOOD TORCH.
      
      SO INSTEAD OF BUYING THIS PHONE I SUGGEST YOU LOOK FOR SOME OTHER PHONES.SPARE YOURSELF THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT."
Xperia U,1,"I WASN'T REALLY BOTHERED ABOUT THE INBUILT MEMORY AS OTHER SPECS SOUNDED GREAT. BUT...
      
      -TERRIBLY SLOW, CAN'T RUN ICS.
      
      -NEED TO BOOT IT UP EVERYDAY, ELSE KEEPS GETTING STUCK.
      
      -FACED PROBLEMS WITH THE TOUCH WITHIN 2 MONTHS OF BUYING THE PHONE. FINALLY ENDED UP REPLACING THE SCREEN.
      
      -TAKES AT LEAST 10 SECS TO START EVEN THE KEYPAD.
      
      -SOMETIMES DOESN'T GET CHARGED, SO ASSUME YOU NEED TO CHARGE YOUR PHONE AS YOU HAVE JUST 10% LEFT AND YOU NEED TO LEAVE SOON ON SOME WORK. SO YOU PLUGIN THINKING IT MIGHT CHARGE. BUT IT WON'T. HAPPENED TOO MANY TIMES.
      
      -THE SOUND IS BAD AS WELL. YOU GET SOME SORT OF DISTURBANCES ONCE IN AWHILE WHEN LISTENING TO SONGS.
      
      -NOT IMPRESSED WITH FLIPKART FOR THE FIRST TIME, AS I GOT A TOTALLY DEFECTIVE PIECE.
      
      P.S: MEMORY TOTALLY FREE CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT I USED JUST 250MG :\"
Xperia U,1,"IF YOU R GONNA BUY THIS THEN THINK AGAIN YOU CAN GET THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS FOR THE SAME
      
      PRICE AND WITH MUCH BETTER COFIGS IT HAS 4.0 ANDROID OS AS WELL AS MORE RAM MEMORY
      
      SO....THINK TWICE YOU EVEN GET A DUOS PHONE!. I PERSONALLY NEVER USED ANY MOBILE WHICH IS NOT SAMSUNG BECAUSE THEY ARE THE BEST....BUT MY FRIENDS HAVE THIS PHONE AND THEY FACE A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH IT SOME WITH QUALITY AND OTHERS WITH GAMES....."
Xperia U,1,LOL.....WHERE IS THE MEMORY CARD SLOT...AND ONLY 5GB USER AVAILABLE............SONY GET A LIFE.A HRAD ANDROID USERS KNOWS THE VALUE OF MEMORY... SOME MOBILE GAMES SIZED ABT 1-2GB SO AFTER INSTALLING GAMES WHERE WILL WE STORE OUR SONGS AND VIDEOS OR APPLICATIONS............ .......................................................................................................................................................................................!!
Xperia U,1,"LOOK AT THE BATTERY CAPACITY AND U EXPECT US TO USE EXTERNAL THUMB DRIVE TO STORE  ALL THE DATA!!!!!!!  WE ALL KNOW EVEN IN LAPTOPS IT CONSUMES MORE BATTERY POWER IF U ARE USING EXTERNAL STORAGE. AND WITH AN 1300 MAH BATTERY???? EVEN THOUGH THEY CLAIM 40% MORE EFFICIENT(YET TO BE PROVED)AND (WITH BRAVIA ENGINE WCH CONSUMES MORE BATTERY POWER). THIS IS A FOOL'S BUY AND ALL OTHER XPERIA NXT SERIES (P ,SOLA  )"

      ICS UPDATE IS HANGING
      
      NO JELLY BEAN UPDATE (EVEN WIYH SAME CONFIGURATION OF XPERIA GO MOBILE HAVING JELLYBEAN UPDATE BUT XPERIA U DOES'T)
      
      NO MEMORY SLOT
      
      
      MY OPINION IS DONT BUY SONY PRODUCTS, BECAUSE XPERIA U USERS EXPECTING JELLY BEAN UPDATE BECAUSE THEY SPENT 15000 TO 16500 RS ON IT, ITS 2012 MODEL ONLY NOT OLD MODEL SO ALL ARE EXPECTED THAT XPERIA U WILL GET JELLYBEAN UPDATE
      
      
      SONY IS SAYING STUPID REASONS LIKE RESOUTION AND RAM PROBLEMS, IF THE PROBLEMS ARE REAL THEN WHY CAN'T SONY TRYS TO FIX IT, SONY IS TRYING TO FOOL ALL THE XPERIA U USERS AND  MIRO USERS
      
      
      I THINK WHY XPERIA U IS NOT GETTING JELLYBEAN UPDATE FOR
      
      NOW PRESENT XPERIA U MARKET IS WELL BUT XERIA GO MARKET IS GOING SLOW AND NOT ACHIEVING THEIR EXPECTATIONS AT MARKET, SO THEY STOPED JELLY BEAN UPDATE FOR XPERIA U AND RELEASING JB UPDATE FOR XPIREA GO TO INCREASE THE MARKET OF XPREIA GO
      
      
      THIS IS MY OPINION ONLY AND IAM COMMENTING ABOUT SONY ONLY NOT ABOUT FLIPKART, FLIPKART SERVICE IS VERY GOOD. AND HOW MANY OF YOU AGREE WITH ME ?
      
      
      SO DONT BUY SONY PRODUCTS, SONY DONT VALUE OUR MONEY AND FOOL US FOR THEIR SELFISHHH REASONS LIKE DECREASING OPTIONS ON ONE MOBILE TO HIKE OTHER MOBILE
      
      
      ITS LOOKS LIKE ANTI TO SONY BUT USERS HAVE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUYING AND WHAT THEY ARE GETTING"

Xperia U,1,"THOUGH SPECS LOOKS GOOD, COULD NOT SEE IT IN THE PERFORMANCE.
      
      SONY CUSTOM UI LAGS TOO MUCH TO OPEN CONTACTS, MESSAGES, CALL LOGS WHICH ARE THE BASICS FOR ANY PHONE.
      
      
      PICKING UP CALLS IS JUST PURE LUCK!!

      GOODBYE FOR SONY ANDROID PHONES!!"
Xperia U,1,"YES ITS A HARSH WAY TO START A REVIEW ON THIS PHONE.
      
      -SERIOUSLY.? THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED COMMON SENSE OR BRAIN IN COMMON.
      
      -YOU WANT PEOPLE TO STICK UP A PENDRIVE TO A PHONE AND USE IT???? HOW DUMB DOES IT LOOK?? WATS IS A PHONE THEN.? WAT WOULD BE SOOOO DIFFICULT TO GIVE AN EXTENDIBLE MEMORY CARD???? AM READY TO PAY FEW MORE FOR TAT.
      
      -CLOUD STORAGE IS NOT YET AVAILABLE TO INDIAN USERS MY DEAR FRIENDS.
      
      I LOOK DOWN AT SAMSUNG GALAXY ACE USERS. BUT NOW I CONSIDER THEM BETTER WHEN I SEE XPERIA U
      
      
      -YEAH CHIPSET USED BY SONY IS THE SAME USED IN ITS OLD XPERIA SERIES &AMP; THE BATTERY POWER IS LESS THAN NEO V.
      
      
      -THIS PHONE IS ONLY FOR FIRST TIME ANDROID AND SMART PHONE USERS.
      
      YOU CAN NEVER SHOW THIS PHONE OUT AND SAY SEE I HAVE A COOL PHONE. COZ ITS A NO COOL PHONE.
      
      -I'D BE ASHAMED IF I HAD THIS PHONE. I'D RATHER BUY XPERIA NEO V OR XPERIA SOLA. YOU THINK YOU ARE PAYING LESS FOR SO MANY FEATURES. SORRY YOUR ARE WRONG AND U ARE BEING FOOLED SIMPLE. CHEERS CHOOSE WISELY.
      
      -ALWAYS READ RECENT REVIEWS FIRST THEN CERTIFIED BUYERS.
      
      MY SERIOUS ADVICE."
Xperia Z,5,"2DAYS BACK I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM INDIAMART AS LESS IN PRICE COMPARED TO FLIPKART I.E., 35,500. ATLAST I THRASHED AWAY FROM MY S4 WHICH IS PRESENTED BY DAD FROM U.K. XZ HAS BETTER PERFORMANCE EXPECT IN BATTERY PERFORMANCE TO S4... THANKS TO SONY CORP.  ITSDISPLAY IS NORMAL IN ALL ASPECTS WHEREAS S4 DESIGNER DOESN'T KNOW HOW IT BEHAVES IN APPLICATIONS. ITS COLOUR CLARITY AND EVERY THING CHANGES FROM APPLICATION TO APPLICATION. BUT, SONY MANAGES IT. XZ HAS EXCELLENT CLARITY IN VLC AND TEMPLERUN WITH SAME ASPECT RATIO. GUYS, BEST IF YOU BUY FROM INDIAMART.BUILDABAZAAR.COM I.E., MAINTINING BY ADEXMART WITH 30-DAY REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE."
Xperia Z,5,"A BIT OF HEATING PROBLEM APART, THE PHONE IS TOP NOTCH IN ALL TECHNICAL TERMS. I HAD READ A LOT OF REVIEWS THAT CRITICISED ITS VIEWING ANGLES CAN CAMERA ETC. BUT THAT WAS IN RELATION TO THE LIKES OF HTC ONE, WHICH IF ANYTHING, ARE ONLY ONLY MARGINALLY BETTER. THE CAMERA IN THE PHONE IS AWESOME. THE BATTERY LASTS MORE THAN A DAY FOR ME ON THE STAMINA MODE, AND THE FACT THAT I CAN SIMPLY WASH AWAY ANY DIRT MARKS ON IT MAKES IT TRULY SPECTACULAR AND STURDIER THAN THE GALAXY S4 OR S3."

      AWESOME MAN !!!!! TEMPERED GLASS BACK AND FRONT, ITS PREMIUM NO DOUBT IN THAT. YES I TESTED THE WATER PROOF THING AND I WAS AMAZED, THOUGH I WAS A BIT RELUCTANT IN THE BEGINNING. REGARDLESS OF THE HUGE SIZE IT FEELS PRETTY POCKETY.
      
      
      PROCESSOR:
      
      IM NOT THAT A GEEKY GUY TO ELABORATE THIS SESSION. EVEN THEN I MADE SOME CHECKUPS. I GAVE IT TO DOWNLOAD 5 FULLHD VIDEOS AT A TIME AND THEN I STARTED BROWSE HEAVILY, JUMPED SWIFTLY TO PLAY HIGH GRAPHICAL GAMES. I WAS STUNNED NOT EVEN A MICROSECOND DELAY I COULD FIND.
      
      
      CAMERA:
      
      ITS PERFECT WITH AUTOSETUP. DELIVERED HIGH QUALITY PICS AT DAY TIME. BUT AVERAGE PICS ON LOW LIGHT. I SEE N920 GIVES BRUTALLY BRILLIANT SNAPS AT LOW LIGHT. HDR VIDEO RECORDING, ITS A THING THAT WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN.
      
      
      UI:
      
      HERE IS WERE IM CONVINCED BUT NOT SATISFIED. THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE MUCH RESEARCH HERE. MAIN MENU LOOKS BORING.
      
      
      OVERALL ITS A PERFECT PHONE AND YOU WILL NEVER EVER FEEL GUILTY FOR CHOOSING IT. GRAB IT.!!!!!"
Xperia Z,5,"AFTER MANY YES'ES AND MANY NO'S, I'M REALLY HAPPY AND GLAD THAT I OWN THIS SMARTPHONE. WELL IF YOU'RE HERE, SEEKING ABOUT REVIEWS OF THIS PHONE THEN YOU MUST HAVE ALREADY HEARD A LOT OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS LIKE IT HAS POOR VIEWING ANGLES, GETS HEATED UP AND BLA BLA. I WOULD JUST ADVISE YOU, ONLY GO WITH REVIEW WHICH HAS A CERTIFIED REVIEW BADGE AND THE ONES WHO'VE BOUGHT THE PHONE IN REAL AS HERE, MOST OF THE REVIEWERS DON'T EVEN HAVE THE PHONE NOR PLAN TO HAVE IT BUT STILL ARE WRITING REVIEWS TO DOWNTRODDEN THE ONES WHO'RE WILLING TO BUY IT. BEING AN OWNER OF THE XPERIA Z, HERE'S MY PERSONAL NOTE REGARDING THE SAME-
      
      
      1. IT'S A SMARTPHONE. THERE ISN'T ANY SMARTPHONE OUT THERE WHICH DOESN'T GETS HEATED UP WHEN YOU PLAY LOW/HIGH GRAPHICS GAMES, SURF THE INTERNET FOR A LONG TIME, WATCH MOVIES/VIDEOS, CALL UP SOMEONE AND TALK WITH THEM FOR QUIET A LONG TIME ETC. OF COURSE, ANY DEVICE WOULD GET HOT IF YOU DO THE ABOVE MENTIONED THINGS. BUT THE COOLEST THING ABOUT THIS DEVICE IS, WHEN IT HEATS UP YOU CAN COOL IT UP QUICKLY BY PLACING IT IN A BOWL OF WATER. THIS BEATS 'EM ALL.
      
      
      2. NO WONDER PEOPLE USE THEIR PHONES EITHER IN PORTRAIT MODE OR IN LANDSCAPE MODE, NO MATTER IN WHATEVER POSTURE THEY'RE. IF WE TALK ABOUT THE POOR VIEWING ANGLES THEN YES IT IS TRUE BUT I DON'T GET ONE THING, WHAT WOULD ONE GET BY VIEWING THEIR PHONE DIAGONALLY? I MEAN THERE WOULD HARDLY ANYONE WHO USES HIS/HER PHONE DIAGONALLY FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE.
      
      
      3. XPERIA Z COMES WITH A JELLY BEAN VERSION OF 4.1.2 AND STILL THIS IS BIG QUESTION FOR MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WHY IT DOESN'T COMES WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF 4.2? GUYS, CAN'T YOU HAVE SOME PATIENCE? IT'S BEEN SAID THAT THE PHONE CAN BE UPGRADED TO 4.2 SO WHY NOT JUST WAIT FOR THE OFFICIAL UPDATE OTA? WITH 4.1.2 THE DEVICE PERFORMS EXTREMELY WELL AND SMOOTH, THERE AIN'T NO LAGS DURING NAVIGATION, EASE SCROLLING AND PROVIDES A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      4. SOUND QUALITY IS AVERAGE. SONY IS WELL KNOWN TO PROVIDE RICH SOUND EXPERIENCE ON EARPHONES RATHER ON IT'S SPEAKERS. ACTUALLY, THE PLACEMENT OF THE SPEAKER IS NOT WELL. DUE TO IT'S ALIGNMENT IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT, IT FEELS LIKE THE MUSIC PLAYS ON ONE HALVE OF THE SPEAKER. BUT ANYWAYS, THE SOUND IS SUPERB ON ANY EARPHONES.
      
      
      5. CAMERA QUALITY IS SUPERB, BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ONE. I ESPECIALLY LOVED, FRONT CAMERA'S CLARITY. SKYPING IS MUCH CLEAR WITH THE 2.2 MP CAM!
      
      
      6. BATTERY'S STAND BY TIME IS A BIT ABOVE THE AVERAGE AT IT'S BEST. THE PHONE TAKES AROUND 30 MINUTES TO GET FULLY CHARGED WHILE AT IT'S DISCHARGED STATE. BEING A SMARTPHONE, THE BATTERY WILL DRAIN THE MOMENT YOU START PLAYING GAMES, WATCHING VIDEOS OR SURFING THE INTERNET. STILL IT'S TOTALLY COOL COZ THE AVERAGE USAGE OF THE BATTERY IS AROUND 4-5 HOURS IF YOU USE IT CONTINUOUSLY. IN THE END, BATTERY LIFE IS DECENT FOR HEAVY USE.
      
      
      7. THE PHONE'S DURABILITY IS THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS DEVICE. I  BET YOU MUST HAVE DEVELOPED YOUR ENGROSSMENT WHEN YOU'D HAVE SEEN IT GETTING WASHED WITH WATER. BOOYEAH! THE WATERPROOF AND DUST RESISTANT FEATURES ARE THE TOP NOTCH MERITS OF XPERIA Z. EVERY PORT HAS IT'S SAFETY GEARS WHICH HELP THEM FROM STAYING OUT OF THE WATER. THE SPEAKER AND MIC ARE MADE WATERPROOF SO IT DOESN'T NEEDS ANY ATTENTION IF WATER GETS INTO IT. MAKE SURE THAT ALL YOUR FLAPS ARE CLOSED WHEN YOU DIP IT IN THE WATER FOR A TEST OR IT GETS WET DUE TO RAIN OR SOMETHING ELSE AS SONY WON'T HOLD ANY RESPONSIBILITIES IF THE PHONE IS MADE CONTACT WITH WATER WITH THE FLAPS OPEN. AS IT WILL MAKE YOUR PHONE SUFFER!
      
      
      8. VOICE AND CALL CLARITY IS AS CLEAN AS WATER. WITH SONY'S MICROPHONE NOISE SUPPRESSION, ONE CAN REDUCE THE BACKGROUND NOISE DURING A CALL. YOU CAN ALSO SET THE CALL EQUALIZER TO BRIGHT OR SMOOTH FOR MORE BETTER SURROUNDING SOUND. YOU CAN ALSO GET A RICHER VOICE LISTENING EXPERIENCE DURING CALLS BY ENABLING SPEAKER VOICE ENHANCEMENT.
      
      
      9. INTERNAL MEMORY IS OF 16GB OUT OF WHICH USER AVAILABLE IS 11 GB. THIS IS WELL ENOUGH FOR YOUR MUSIC AND PICTURES. FOR STORING YOUR HD MOVIES, YOU CAN UPGRADE YOUR STORAGE WITH A 32GB/64GB CARD.
      
      
      10. THE UI IS SOOTHINGLY RESPONSIVE AND LUSTROUS. IT PROVIDES A GOOD UX AND THE ALIGNMENT OF THE SHORTCUTS, WIDGETS AND APPS IS VERY WELL. THE DRAGON TRAIL GLASS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE PHONE MAKES IT LOOKS ELEGANTLY SEXY. THE FRONT ONE IS A SHATTERPROOF GLASS WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE YET ON ANY OTHER PHONES.
      
      
      TIPS:
      
      
      - WHILE PUTTING THE PROVIDED SCREEN GUARD ON TO THE PHONE, DON'T USE THE GIVEN PLASTIC PIECE AS WHILE YOU'RE FLATTENING THE SCREEN FROM ONE SIDE, THE OTHER SIDE MAY RESULT IN HAVING BUBBLES. USE A CREDIT/DEBIT/ID CARD HORIZONTALLY WHILE APPLYING THE LAMINATION SO AS  THE SCREEN STICKS APPROPRIATELY TO BOTH SIDES WITHOUT LEAVING BEHIND ANY BUBBLES.
      
      
      CONCLUSION:
      
      
      THIS SMARTPHONE IS WORTH OF YOUR EVERY BUCKS AND GIVES YOU A SUPERIOR PERSONALITY WHEN YOU HOLD IT. YOU WON'T LIKE TO PAY AROUND 45-50K FOR A PHONE WITH SIMILAR DESIGN ARCHITECTURE OF IT'S PREDECESSORS. THE ONLY PHONE WHICH CAN GIVE XPERIA Z A CLOSER COMPETITION WILL BE THE HTC ONE."
Xperia Z,5,"ALMOST EVERY CERTIFIED BUYER FROM FLIPKART GAVE A 5 STAR RATING EXCEPT 4 PEOPLE AND THE REMAINING IDIOTS DIDN'T EVEN USED IT AND ARE GIVING 1, 2, 3...RATINGS...WELL I PERSONALLY DIDN'T OWN IT, BUT USED Z FROM MY FRND AND IS SIMPLY AWESOME..ONLY ONE CAN COMPETE THIS BEAST IS HTC ONE...... GS4 CANNOT COMPETE WITH THIS. THOUGH IT HAD SOME EXCELLENT FEATURES WHICH ARE NOT USEFUL IN DAY-DAY LIFE N THE OTHER USEFUL N COOL FEATURES IT HAD ARE COPIED....IF ANYONE WANTED TO HAVE POWERFUL PERFORMANCE,,DON'T REGRET IN BUYING THIS"
Xperia Z,5,"AMAZING DISPLAY, CAMERA, LOOKS, AUDIO, VIDEO...THERE IS SIMPLY NOTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE THAT YOU WONT GO CRAZY ABOUT..!!!
      
      I JUST GOT THE PHONE YESTERDAY AND I ALREADY LOVE IT. I DONT KNOW WHY SOME PEOPLE WROTE REVIEWS ABOUT ITS DISPLAY THAT IT IS NOT IN COMPARISON TO SAMSUNG'S AMOLED DISPLAY BUT I FEEL THE SONY XPERIA DISPLAY IS MUCH MORE REAL LIFE LIKE IN COMPARISON TO THAT OF GALAXY PHONE...
      
      IN SHORT, THE BEST PHONE IN THE MARKET AT PRESENT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GOOD LOOKS, AMAZING DESIGN AND AWESOME CAMERA!!"
Xperia Z,5,"AT FIRST I WAS RELUCTANT TO PURCHASE THIS PHONE OFF THE INTERNET.
      
      
      I PLACED THE ORDER SOMETIME IN THE AFTERNOON AND I RECEIVED IT THE NEXT DAY. IT WAS COMPLETELY SEALED...
      
      
      GOT A COMPLIMENTARY CASE COVER AND SCRATCH GUARD TO GO WITH IT.
      
      
      I LOVE THE PHONE AND THE 2GB RAM WORKS PERFECTLY WITH ANDROID 4.2.2.
      
      
      IF YOU LIKE SONY, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPINTED."
Xperia Z,5,"BAD VIEWING ANGLE? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE CRAVE FOR LARGER VIEWING ANGLES. SERIOUSLY, I WOULDN'T WANT A PERSON SEATED BESIDE ME PEEKING INTO MY SMARTPHONE.
      
      
      PHONE GETS HEATED UP? WHICH SMARTPHONE DOESN'T GET HEATED UP WHEN YOU UTILIZE ITS POWER AND RESOURCES? WHICH PC, FOR THAT MATTER, DOES NOT GET HEATED UP? BY THE WAY, WHICH PC OR EVEN A PHONE CAN BE COOLED AS FAST AS YOU CAN WITH SONY XZ. JUST DROP IT IN WATER FOR GOD'S SAKE!
      
      
      TOO EXPENSIVE? LET ME TELL YOU, THIS PHONE IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE OF ITS CLASS. YES, SGS3 IS CHEAPER BUT HAS ONLY 1 GB RAM AND HENCE WILL NOT BE UPGRADABLE AFTER NEXT FEW VERSIONS OF ANDROID (MAY TAKE 3-5 YEARS). SGS4 IS PRICED CLOSE TO SONY XZ BUT HAS NO WATER/DUST/DROP PROOFING. FOR THAT MATTER, COMPARE SGS4 WITH SONY XZL.
      
      
      POOR BATTERY LIFE? AS A SMARTPHONE USER, YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO USE IT WISELY TO GET IT RUN FOR A WHOLE DAY! I AM ABLE TO USE THIS FOR A WHOLE DAY WITHOUT CHARGING IN THE MIDDLE. YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE GOOD CHARGING HABITS. SEARCH ONLINE FOR GOOD CHARGING HABITS.
      
      
      LED BETTER THAN LCD? YOU GOTTA SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT. LCD MIGHT LOSE A LITTLE WHEN IT COMES TO REFLECTIONS IN DAYLIGHT. BUT THE GRAYS THAT WE MOSTLY SEE IN SONY XZ IS BECAUSE NOTIFICATION AREA AND FEW OTHER BORDERS ON SONY UX ARE COLORED GRAY. THEY ARE BEING CHANGED TO BLACK IN THE COMING UPDATE.
      
      
      DISPLAY IS FINGER PRINT MAGNET? WASH IT, GODDAMN IT. WASH IT WITH SOAP WATER IF YOU WISH. YOU CANNOT DO THAT TO ANY PHONE OUT THERE.
      
      
      NOT A GREAT SPEAKER? THAT'S A SMALL COMPROMISE FOR A LARGER ADVANTAGE - RUGGEDNESS. IT IS SMALL (BUT GOOD ENOUGH FOR LOUD SPEAKER WHILE ON A CALL).
      
      
      16 GB NOT ENOUGH? ONLY 11 GB INTERNAL MEMORY IS AVAILABLE FOR USER. THAT WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO STORE AND INSTALL APPS. FOR SONGS AND MOVIES, MOUNT A 32 GB CARD IN IT. SOMEBODY PROVED THE PHONE CAN WORK WITH 64 GB CARD TOO. OR, GET AN OTG CABLE AND USE A PEN DRIVE WITH UPTO 120 GB. WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU WANT?
      
      
      FLAPS COVERING THE PORTS ARE FRAGILE? NO, THEY ARE NOT. I DON'T FEEL THEM TO BE FRAGILE AT ALL. MADE OF MATERIALS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO LAST LONGER, THEY WILL SERVE FOR LONG.
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS NOT GETTING OBSOLETE ANY SOONER THAN 7-8 YEARS. WORTH YOUR BUCK!"
Xperia Z,5,"BEST PHONE FROM BEST COMPANY....
      
      
      IF U R GONA BUY IT, DON'T HESITATE....
      
      
      PHONE IS BEST OF ITS AGES AND PLEASE DON'T COMPARE THIS WITH ANY OTHER MOBILES. THEY ARE NOT EVEN IN THE SCALE OF QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE...."
Xperia Z,5,"BOUGHT IT FROM SONY DEALER IN KOLKATA, AMAZING PHONE .. DE BEST ANDROID QUAD CORE PHONE...GUYS FORGET ABOUT THE NEGATIVE PEOPLE SAY OR WRITE. U GOT TO USE IT KNOW HOW GOOD IT IS. PREMIUM PHONE FROM SONY . PROUD OWNER."
Xperia Z,5,BOUGHT THIS PHONE ON MY B'DAY .DESIGN OF PHONE IS AWESOME AND COLORS ARE VERY RICH. I DID LOTS OF RESEARCH AND COMPARISON BETWEEN XPERIA Z AND SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 BEFORE BUYING. AND I MADE THE BEST DECISION . PHONE IS JUST AMAZING. EVERTHING IS GREAT :)
Xperia Z,5,FINALLY SONY DELIVERS ON THE HYPE. A GOOD PHONE WITH A FAR BETTER DESIGN THAN S4. HTC ONE IS THE ONLY PHONE WHICH COMES CLOSE TO ITS AESTHETICS. BATTERY LIFE IS AVERAGE AT BEST AND THE WATER PROOFING THING IS A COOL GIMMICK BUT NOT SURE HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS. VIEWING ANGLES COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT HEY WE ONLY LOOK AT THE PHONE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US!! AN AWESOME PHONE AND A GOOD AND CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE TO HTC ONE. SOUND QUALITY IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE USUAL SONY STANDARDS. GO FOR IT AND YOU WONT REGRET IT!!
Xperia Z,5,"FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK FLIPKART FOR THEIR EXPRESS DELIVERY. I HAD ORDERED THE COMBO VERSION OF XPERIA Z ON THE 23RD OF APRIL AND IT REACHED ME ON THE 24TH. THE PORTABLE CHARGER REACHED ME ON 25TH SINCE IT HAD TO BE SHIPPED FROM DELHI TO MY PLACE.
      
      
      IT'S BEEN A WEEK SINCE I STARTED USING THE XPERIA Z AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! THE PHONE LOOKS SO GOOD AND IT FEELS VERY LIGHT. IT FITS PERFECTLY IN MY HAND.. I HAD UPGRADED TO THE XPERIA Z FROM A PHONE THAT WAS BOUGHT 4 YEARS AGO. SO I'M HAVING A NICE TIME USING A SMARTPHONE WITH AN ANDROID OS. THE PRO CASE AND THE SONY HEADSET WERE GOOD.
      
      
      I HAD SO MANY THOUGHTS BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE. I WAS READING REVIEWS FROM SO MANY SITES AND WATCHING A LOT OF REVIEWS ON YOUTUBE FOR A WHILE. THEN I FINALLY PICKED THIS ONE UP AND I DON'T REGRET IT. I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THE XPERIA Z. I'VE ALREADY GOT SO MANY COMPLIMENTS FROM MY FRIENDS REGARDING THE PHONE AND THE CAMERA. THE PHONE DOES GET A BIT HOT AFTER CONSTANT USE OF 3G OR APPS THAT INVOLVE HIGH GRAPHICS BUT WHY WOULD YOU CARE WHEN YOU CAN DUNK IT IN THE WATER TO COOL IT OFF. I'VE ALREADY TRIED DOING THIS TOO.
      
      
      THE SPEAKER VOLUME IS A LITTLE LOW COMPARED TO THE OTHER PHONES. BUT I LISTEN TO SONGS ON MY PRO IN-EAR MONITORS SO THE QUALITY IS TOO GOOD. THE RINGER VOLUME SEEMS FINE TO ME.
      
      
      OVERALL, THIS SMARTPHONE IS REALLY WORTH THE MONEY. IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO GET THIS THEN DON'T HAVE ANY SECOND OPTIONS. GO AHEAD AND BUY IT. YOU'LL FEEL REALLY GOOD WHEN YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND.
      
      THE PORTABLE CHARGER IS GOOD TOO. IT CHARGES ABOUT 70% OF MY XPERIA Z'S BATTERY WHEN THE CHARGER IS FULLY LOADED.
      
      
      XPERIA Z - 4/5
      
      EVEREADY UM 22 POWER BANK - 3.5/5"
Xperia Z,5,"FIRSTLY I AM NOT A SONY OR A SAMSUNG FANBOY.. NOBODY'S GIVING ME A CUT TO WRITE THIS REVIEW ;)
      
      
      SO LET'S BEGIN:-
      
      FIRST THINGS FIRST YOU JUST CANNOT COMPARE TWO PHONES EVENTUALLY ITS ALL ABOUT PERSONAL CHOICE.. S4 HAS GREAT HARDWARE UNDER THE HOOD AND IT BOASTS OF GREAT THINGS ON PAPER..SUPER AMOLED SCREEN IS WHAT SAMSUNG BOASTS OF AND INDEED IT IS A WINNER WHEN COMPARING WITH XPERIA Z SCREEN. S4 HAS 8 CORES WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD, ITS LIKE HAVING 8 TYRES FOR A CAR WHICH RUNS ON 4. 4 CORES WILL BE NOT IN USE AT ANY POINT AND TIME. S4 AND XZ PERFORM EQUALLY GOOD IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE. THERE IS NO LAG AND GOING BY THE WAY SONY BACKS IT'S HARDWARE XZ IS GOING TO OUT PERFORM S4 IN THE NEAR FUTURE. XZ HAS GLASS FINISH WHEREAS S4 IS MADE FROM CHEAP PLASTIC AND BELIEVE ME AFTER A FEW MONTHS YOU ARE GONNA HATE THAT CHEAP PLASTIC IN YOUR HAND. S4 HAS GREAT FEATURES BUT WHEN AND WILL THEY BE USED IS A BIG QUESTION. XZ HAS FEATURES WHICH ARE TO BE USED IN DAY TO DAY USE. YES, CAMERA FOR S4 SURELY SCORES BETTER THAN XZ BUT THEN IF YOU WANT AN AMAZINGLY GOOD CAM WHY NOT BUY A DSLR INSTEAD. :-P(JK!!)
      
      THE BATTERY IN THE STAMINA MODE LASTS ABOUT 48 HOURS WITH LIGHT USAGE WHICH IS PRETTY DAMN GOOD.. THE PRICE OF S4 I HEARD IS GOING TO BE AROUND 45K WHICH IS APPROX 8K MORE THAN XZ AND IF YOU HAVE 45K AT YOUR DISPOSAL THEN WHY NOT BUY RICH AND USELESS PEOPLE'S PHONE BY THE NAME OF APPLE IPHONE5.
      
      AS FAR AS I CAN SEE S4 AND XZ ARE HEAD TO HEAD AND YOU JUST CANNOT WRITE OFF THIS BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MACHINE CALLED XPERIA Z. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED MY VOTE GOES TO SONY XPERIA Z FOR THE ROYAL TREATMENT IT GIVES TO THE USER. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME SAMSUNG. :-)
      
      I HAVE NOT EVEN TAKEN HTC ONE INTO ACCOUNT AS HTC SUPPORT IS REALLY BAD IN INDIA.. SORRY HTC BUT TRUTH BE TOLD :-P"
Xperia Z,5,"FIRSTLY, FLIPKART SHIPPED IT WITHIN A WEEK OF ITS RELEASE TO THE MARKET AND IN PERFECTLY AWESOME SHAPE..
      
      
      SONY XPERIA Z, AS THEY CLAIMED IS THE BEST OF SONY,
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. IT BOASTS A 5"" SCREEN AND ITS COMPLETELY WITHIN REACH OF YOUR HAND, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN STILL OPERATE YOUR PHONE WITH JUST ONE HAND.
      
      2. BATTERY, FOR 2G LASTS FOR MORE THAN ONE AND HALF AND WHILE. ON 3G ITS LITTLE LOWER.
      
      3. STAMINA MODE, AWESOME FEATURE HELPS YOU TO UTILIZE YOUR PHONE FOR LONGER TIMES, WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING OUT OF BATTERY.
      
      4. ""LOOKS"", YOU WILL BE TERRIFIED WITH IT AT FIRST SIGHT.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. WHILE MAKING IT WATERPROOF THERE IS WHOLE LOT OF PORT COVERING, WHICH MIGHT PROVE ANNOYING WHILE YOU WANT TO USE THE PORT.
      
      2. SOFTWARE, SONY HASN'T REALLY WORKED ON IT. ALMOST A VANILLA ANDROID 4.1 NO REALLY GREAT IMPROVEMENTS.
      
      3. CAMERA QUALITY CAN BE ANNOYING SOMETIMES, WHILE THE PICTURES YOU TAKE LOOK GREAT DUE BRAVIA ON THE PHONE, BUT HAVE QUITE A APPRECIABLE NOISE WHILE YOU SEE THEM ON PC/ANY OTHER DEVICE.
      
      4. DUST MAGNET, IT ATTRACTS HELL LOT OF DUST :(
      
      
      OVERALL, THIS IS A GADGET TO HAVE IN YOUR POCKET. ONLY, IF YOU ARE READY TO SHELL OUT SOME MONEY AND NEGLECT SOME OF ITS NEGATIVE POINTS."
Xperia Z,5,"FOR QUITE SOMETIME I HAVE BEEN ASKING MYSELF, HOW PPL CAN GO FOR SUCH EXPENSIVE MOBILES OF 40K AND +. BUT WHEN I SAW THE OFFICIAL VIDEO OF THIS PHONE FROM SONY. OH GOD! IT SWEPT ME OF MY FEAT COMPLETELY.
      
      
      IT IS AMAZING IN EVERY ASPECT OF A PHONE. STYLISH, SLIM, FULL HD, FASTEST AND MAINLY YOU DON'T NEED TO BE BOTHERED WHEN YOU ARE AROUND WATER AREA.
      
      
      I PRE-ORDERED THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART AS SOON IT WAS MADE AVAILABLE LAST WEEK. FLIPKART IS YET THE DELIVER THE PHONE TO ME. BUT ITS OKAY. IF YOU ARE GETTING THE BEST, YOU HAVE TO WAIT.. RIGHT?? :)"
Xperia Z,5,"GOODIES
      
      1 BUILD QUALITY - FEELS VERY PREMIUM, BALANCED DESIGN, VERY SLIM, TOUGH AND WATERPROOF.
      
      2 DISPLAY - VERY GOOD SHARPNESS, EXCELLENT UNDER DIRECT SUNLIGHT, VERY GOOD BRIGHTNESS.
      
      3 SOUND - EXCELLENT WHEN ATTACHED TO ANY HEADPHONE, SPEAKER SERVES GENERAL PURPOSE OF RINGING AND NOTIFICATION.
      
      4 PROCESSING POWER - MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR SMARTPHONE USAGE AND GAMING.
      
      5 STORAGE - 16 GB INBUILT + 64 GB EXPANDABLE = 80 GB MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR SMARTPHONE CATEGORY
      
      6 CAMERA - REQUIRE SPECIAL EXPERTISE TO GET THE BEST RESULT FROM 13 MP. LOTS OF CAMERA SETTINGS, VERY GOOD VIDEO RECORDING.
      
      
      BADDIES
      
      1 SHATTERPROOF SHEET HAVE TENDENCY TO SCRATCH EASILY.
      
      2 LARGER BATTERY REQUIRED.
      
      3 LOCK SCREEN IS NOT AS ATTRACTIVE AS COMPETITOR.
      
      
      OVERALL VERY GOOD PRODUCT."
Xperia Z,5,"GOT DELIVERY OF THIS PHONE LAST MONDAY. MY CO-WORKERS TOOK LOT OF PICTURES, PICTURES LOOK GREAT. INSTALLED SKYPE FOR ANDROID, VERY GOOD CLARITY.
      
      
      WILL PUT THIS PHONE FOR HEAVY USE THIS WEEKEND AND KEEP YOU POSTED."
Xperia Z,5,"GOT IT TODAY AND FEELING AWESOME!!! FEELS RIGHT INTO YOUR HAND AND ITS SLEEKNESS IS THE MOST IMPRESSING THING OF THIS PHONE. ITS A SOLID THING, FEELS NO PLASTIC MADE LIKE THOSE OF SAMSUNG OR OTHERS.
      
      
      THE ONE CON THAT I HAVE DISCOVERED TILL NOW IS THAT THERE IS NO CAMERA BUTTON. YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THE SCREEN FOR TAKING A SNAP. HAVING SUCH AN AWESOME CAMERA IMPLIES MORE SNAPS, BUT WITHOUT THE BUTTON, ITS FEELS BIT UNCOMFORTABLE.
      
      
      BUT WHO CARES, WHEN COMPARED WITH QUAD CORE AND MASSIVE 2GB RAM. MAN, ITS TREMENDOUS FAST AND THE VIDEO QUALITY WITH BRAVIA ENGINE IS SIMPLE THE SUPER !!"

      FINAL WORD:
      
      AN EASY AND STRONG RECOMMENDATION FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR A SUPER PHONE WITH PREMUIM LOOKS AND DURABILITY."

Xperia Z,5,"HAD BEEN GOING THROUGH A FEW REVIEWS WHICH LOOKED LIKE
      
      COMPLETELY DEGRADING THE PRODUCT'S POPULARITY. I HAVE BEEN
      
      ONE OF THE VERY FEW USERS WHO HAD PRE-ORDERED THIS PHONE AND AFTER TWO MONTHS OF USAGE,
      
      I AM NOW A DIE-HARD FAN OF SONY. PLEASE DONT GO WITH REVIEWS
      
      WHICH ARE FAKE AND DONT ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY AND PERFORMANCE
      
      OF THE PHONE.
      
      
      THERE ARE QUITE A FEW NEGATIVES, THE BATTERY DRAINS WITH
      
      COMBINED USAGE OF WI-FI NETWORK AND VIDEO STREAMING IN HD TOGETHER.
      
      OTHER WISE, THE BATTERY IS QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR JUST OVER A
      
      DAY'S USAGE AND WITH THE NEW UPDATE ON Z, IT HAS QUITE IMPROVED
      
      BETTERY PERFORMANCE IN ADDITION TO THE WHITE BALANCE AND
      
      PULSE LED NOTIFICATION SETTINGS.
      
      
      GAMES RUN WITH ALMOST NO EFFORT, ALTHOUGH PLAYING GAMES OVER AN HOUR HEATS UP

      TORRENT DOWNLOADS + YOUTUBE VIDEO STREAMING + MANY MORE PROCESSES

Xperia Z,5,"HAVE HAD AN EYE FOR THIS DEVICE FOR A LONG TIME NOW. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I AM EXPERIENCING A SONY MOBILE. AS USUAL FLIPKART HAS DELIVERED THIS WELL IN TIME.
      
      
      TILL NOW I HAVE BEEN SEEING THE BEAUTY OF THIS BEAST ONLY ON VARIOUS WEBSITES. BUT ONCE YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HANDS ITS JUST WOW!
      
      
      AN IMPRESSION I GOT FROM A VIDEO DEMO ON DIGIT (THINKDIGIT) IS THAT THE Z'S COLORS LOOK WASHED OUT AND THE DISPLAY IS PALE AS COMPARED TO THE NOKIA LUMIA. I DON'T KNOW IF THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE XPERIA Z IS KEPT OR SOMETHING, BUT BOTH THE PHONES WERE KEPT SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE DISPLAY TURNED ON."
Xperia Z,5,"HEY EVERYONE,
      
      
      THIS IS MY FIRST ANDROID SMARTPHONE.
      
      
      I AM PROUD TO OWN MY LOVELY XPERIA Z.
      
      
      IT HAS MADE ME FAMOUS AMONG MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES AND THE PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT IT START WITH A WOW EXPRESSION ON THEIR FACE. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THIS IS MY FIRST SMARTPHONE SO I AM JUST PUTTING MY EXPERIENCES WITH THIS PHONE WHICH IS NOT A TECHNICAL REVIEW LIKE OTHERS.
      
      
      DESIGN: THE DESIGN IS STUNNING. YOU WON'T FEEL LIKE HOLDING AN ORDINARY PHONE, IT IS RIGID, STRONG, DURABLE AND ABOVE ALL WATER PROOF. I WON'T COMMENT ON OTHER PHONES AS I HAVE NOT USED THEM.
      
      
      I AM QUITE SCARED ABOUT DOING DROP TEST OR WATER RESISTANCE TEST AS I HAVE PAID A HUGE MONEY FOR THIS. BUT I HAVE TESTED IT BY PUTTING IT INSIDE A WATER MUG AND NOTHING HAPPENED WHICH SHOULD BE APPRECIATED.
      
      
      BATTERY: THE BATTERY DRAINS VERY QUICKLY WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. I KNOW ALL SMARTPHONES ARE LIKE THIS BUT I EXPECTED MORE FROM SONY. THE BATTERY STAMINA MODE DOES NOT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE OR NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL. I AM NOT USING MY PHONE FOR GAMING OR ANY PROCESSING RICH APPS BUT STILL THE BATTERY LASTS ONLY FOR AROUND 8-9 HOURS. I JUST BROWSE FOR AROUND 1 HOUR WHICH INCLUDES CHECKING MAILS, MAKING ONLINE TRANSACTION THROUGH NETBANKING, NOTHING MUCH.
      
      
      CAMERA: THE CEMERA IS GOOD BUT NOT SO GREAT. IN LOW LIGHT THE CLARITY IS NOT THERE AND I CAN SEE A LOT OF NOISE. OTHER THAN THIS, I HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THE CAMERA. IT HAS GOT A LOT OF FEATURES WHICH OTHER COMPETITORS ARE STILL SCRATCHING THEIR HEAD FOR.
      
      
      THE PHONE GETS HEATED UP SO MUCH THAT I CAN'T HOLD IT IN MY HANDS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. IT MAY SOUND FUNNY BUT I PUT IT INTO WATER TO COOL IT DOWN. THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO PREVENT THE PHONE FROM GETTING SO HOT.
      
      
      CALL QUALITY: THE VOICE QUALITY ENHANCEMENTS IN THE SETTINGS SERIOUSLY WORKS AND IT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE. I HAD A LG GD510 BEFORE WHICH IS SO NOISY AND I HAD TO SCREAM FOR MY VOICE TO BE HEARD FOR THE PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE. BUT THIS PHONE IS SO COOL, I CAN SPEAK WITH MY FRIENDS VERY SLOWLY AND STILL MY VOICE IS HEARD. THEY EVEN TOLD ME THAT MY VOICE IS CLEAR AND AUDIBLE THAN BEFORE EVEN THOUGH I SPOKE VERY SLOWLY. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.
      
      
      AUDIO: I HAVEN'T USED MY PHONE TO LISTEN SONGS MUCH TILL NOW. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS, THE SONGS ARE CLEARLY HEARD AND I CAN GET LOST WITH IT. BUT IT IS NOT SO LOUD LIKE OTHER PHONES WHICH I HAVE USED EARLIER. MY PREVIOUS PHONES, NOKIA BASIC SETS HAD A MUCH HIGH SOUND OUTPUT THAN THIS. BUT I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AS IT IS LOUD ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR IN MY HEADPHONES.
      
      
      THE HEADSET PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE PHONE AND THE SONY HEADPHONE WHICH IS PROVIDED FREE OF COST IS COOL, AWESOME AND I JUST LOVE IT. IT CAN BE TURNED, TWISTED AND ITS VERY FLEXIBLE. IT IS A GOOD CONTRIBUTION FROM SONY SIDE.
      
      
      I DO NOT SEE ANY ISSUES WITH THE VIEWING ANGLE, IT IS VISIBLE FOR ME. I HOPE OTHERS HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR EYES. BUT THE SCREEN IS NOT SO VISIBLE WHEN I AM OUTSIDE SAY IN BRIGHT SUN LIGHT. I HAVE TO KEEP MY HAND OVER THE PHONE TO HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF THE DISPLAY OR MOVE TO SHADY PLACE. I DO NOT SEE THIS AS A ISSUE AS IT IS THERE IN OTHER PHONES TOO.
      
      
      I LIKE KEEPING WALLPAPERS OF MY FAVORITE ACTRESSES BUT IT DRAINS BATTERY VERY BADLY SO I ENDED UP HAVING A BLANK DISPLAY WITH NO WALLPAPER. THIS IS BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME.
      
      
      THE POSITION OF THE SPEAKERS AT THE RIGHT BOTTOM IS SOMEWHAT WRONG WHICH IS ALREADY DISCUSSED IN MANY REVIEWS ON INTERNET. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS DESIGN IS YOU CAN'T HEAR THE SOUND WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING GAMES AS MOST PEOPLE TEND TO KEEP THEIR FINGERS OVER THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE PHONE WHICH BLOCKS THE SOUND COMPLETELY. I HAVE GOT USED TO IT BUT NOT SURE ABOUT THE OTHERS. THE ONLY ADVANTAGE I CAN SEE FROM THIS DESIGN IS THAT THE RINGTONE CAN BE HEARD EVEN IF THE PHONE IS DEEP INSIDE THE POCKET.
      
      
      SOME PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THAT THE WIFI IS TURNED OFF WHEN THE SCREEN IS LOCKED BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY SUCH ISSUE.
      
      
      THERE IS A HOLE LOT OF FEATURES AVAILABLE IN THE PHONE. I HAVE USED ONLY FEW OF THEM AND THERE IS A LOT YET TO BE DISCOVERED.
      
      
      SONY HAS PROVIDED THE PHONE SOFTWARE UPDATE VERY QUICKLY AS PROMISED BUT THEY SHOULD MAKE IT QUICK LIKE SAMSUNG AND DELIGHT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
      
      
      I AM TELLING YOU THIS AGAIN, I AM NOT REVIEWING THE PHONE, I AM JUST PUTTING WORDS ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES WITH THIS PHONE TILL NOW.
      
      
      IT HAS BEEN 2 WEEKS ON AND I LOVE MY XPERIA Z VERY BADLY. PEOPLE ARE CRAZY ABOUT MY PHONE.
      
      
      GO FOR IT, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE."
Xperia Z,5,"HEY! I THINK THIS IS THE BEST MOBILE YOU WANT HAVE IT'S BATTERY LIFE IS NICE, FOR CAMERA THERE IS NO WORD IN MY MIND, JUST SPEECHLESS, FOR ITS OS THE LATEST ONE, ITS THE MOST ENTERTAINING MOBILE.
      
      SIMPLY THE BEST ONE"
Xperia Z,5,"HI FRIENDS, I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER MY USAGE OVER MONTH TO BE HELPFUL  ( BECAUSE USUALLY FOR FIRST WEEK, WE ARE ALWAYS IMPRESSED BLINDLY WITH ANY NEW MOBILE ! LOL.. )
      
      
      OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, FLIPKART IS BEST ! I GOT A SMS VERY NEXT DAY I PUT COD ALONG WITH DELIVERY BOY'S NAME AND NUMBER ! I CALLED HIM UP AND ARRANGED THE TIME FOR DELIVERY... FLIPKART SERVICE ROCKS !!!!
      
      
      NOW, ABOUT THE DEVICE :
      
      
      PROS :
      
      
      1) LOOK - YEA, I THINK FIRST PRO IS THE LOOK !! IT IS SO PREMIUM ! I MEAN, I PREVIOUSLY OWNED GALAXY S2 AND HTC WILDFIRE S BUT THEY FELT USUAL. WHILE XZ, WHEN I TAKE IT OUT, IT STANDS AHEAD IN CROWD !!!! TRUST ME, I HAVE A FRIEND, WHO BOUGHT S4 (AND ADVICED ME TO BUY IT) , AND WHEN HE FIRST SHOWED IT TO US, MOST OF ASKED IF IT WAS GALAXY GRAND ?? ... LOLZZZ THAT'S SO FRUSTRATING WHEN U BUY 40K DEVICE AND NOT FEEL A BIT OF DIFFERENT ?!
      
      
      2) IP-57 - OKAY, MANY OF YOU WHO ARE SCARRED OF TRYING IT, U R JUSTIFIED, BUT I M A RISK TAKER GUY... I DROPPED THE DEVICE IN WATER AFTER ABOUT....WELL... 10 MINUTE OF STARTING IT !! ( HONESTLY, I WAS BETTING UPON FLIPKART'S 30DAYS REPLACEMENT IF ANYTHING WENT WRONG, LOLLL ) .. NOW, AFTER SEVERAL OCCASSIONS, I AM VERY RELAXED WHEN ANYONE ASK ME TO SHOW WATER RESISTANCE..
      
      
      AND LET ME EXPLAIN THIS IN DETAIL - WHEN I PLAY CRICKET I PUT MY PHONE ON GROUND MUD, AND WASH IT WITH WATER IN FRONT OF OTHER PLAYERS, AND HALF OF THEM FORGET THE GAME SCORE AND JUST KEEP LOOKING AT MY Z !! ... ANOTHER EXAMPLE - WHEN I GO TO MY COLLEGE CANTEEN, MOST OF OUR TABLES ARE MESSED UP WITH TOMATO CATCHUPS AND CHUTNEYS ETC. AND I PUT MY DEICE ON TABLE WITHOUT ANY WORRY...BECAUSE AT THE END OF BREAKFAST, I WASH IT IN CANTEEN BASIN !!!  ..... THIS IS TOTALLY PAISA VASOOL BECAUSE NO OTHER MOBILE CAN GIVE U THIS MUCH FUN AND JOY AND VALUE !! 8))
      
      
      3) DEV SUPPORT -  YEA, BEING RISK TAKER, I HAVE ALREADY FLASHED TENS OF CUSTOM ROMS... AND BELIEVE ME GUYS, THIS DEVICE HAS GOT SERIOUS SUPPORT OVER XDA-DEVELOPERS !! I MEAN, THERE ARE SO MANY ROMS AND KERNELS, AND SO MANY RECOGNIZED DEVS ARE OWNING THIS DEVICE THAT, I THINK FOR NEXT 2 YEARS, THERE WONT BE ANY PROBLEM TO ME FOR ANDROID UPDATES !! ( I LISTED THIS AS A PRO - BECAUSE S4 WHICH IS SELLING IN INDIA IS EXYNOS NOT SNAPDRAGON SOLD IN US.... SO S4 HAS COMPARATEIVELY LESS DEV SUPPORT THAN XZ !!!! )
      
      
      4) 5) 6) 7) ... WELL, REST OF THE PROS LIKE DISPLAY N CAMERA AND ETC ARE ALREADY REVIEWD HERE SO NOT REPEATING IT...  [[ NOTE - PERSONALLY, COMING FROM S2 'S ALMOED, I INITIALLY FELT XZ IS DULL IN COLOUR, BUT AFTER A MONTH, I THINK XZ HAS MORE NATURAL COLOUR.... I MEAN, ON S2 I FELT PAIN IN MY EYES IF I WATCHED TWO MOVIES BACK TO BACK, BUT ON XZ, EYES DON'T STRAIN A BIT EVEN AFTER 5 HOURS OF GAMING !! ]]
      
      
      CON :
      
      
      1) IT HEATS AFTER PLAYING HEAVY GAME MORE THAN AN HOUR ! THOUGH MORE THAN 90% OF ANDROID DEVICE HEATS, I JUST DISLIKE IT.  THE SOLUTION IS -- I PUT IT IN WATER FOR RAPID COOLING !!! ( TOLD U GUYS, I AM TOTLLY PAISA VASOOLING PERSON !! ... U MIGHT TRY BEING MORE CAREFUL IF TOO MUCH WORRIED ABOUT WARRENTY )
      
      
      2) ALL THE PORTS ( CHARGING , HEADPHONE ETC) ARE UNCOMFORTABLE TO OPEN REPEATEDLY...  BUT I GUESS, DUE TO WATER RESISTING I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.
      
      
      FINAL WORDS - FRIENDS, ACCORDING TO ME, THIS IS THE BEST CHOICE AT THIS MOMENT, CONSIDERING RAIN SEASON IS HAPPENING, THIS DEVICE IS PRACTICALLY TOTALLY PAISA VASOOL.."
Xperia Z,5,"HI GUYS,
      
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW AND BELOW ARE A FEW THINGS THAT NEED TO BE PUT ON RECORD.
      
      
      1) MIND BLOWING DISPLAY. HD VIDEOS RUN SMOOTHLY. VIEWING IS A PLEASURE.
      
      2) I WAS INITIALLY APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE CUSTOMIZED UI OF SONY WHICH MADE ALL VERSIONS OF ANDROID LOOK THE SAME ON ALL SONY DEVICES, BUT THE UI IN THIS ONE, ALL THE THEMES AND WALLPAPERS PROVIDE AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE
      
      3) UNLIKE SAMSUNG SMARTPHONES, WHERE ALL DEVICES LOOK THE SAME AND ARE WIDER, THIS ONE IS LONG AND SLEEK. THIS ENSURES THAT WE CAN EASILY WORK AROUND THE PHONE WITH ONE HAND EVEN THOUGH THE SCREEN SIZE IS 5"".
      
      4) I AM NOT A GAMER, BUT EVEN THEN, VERY HAPPY THAT TEMPLE RUN 2 RUNS WITHOUT A HINT OF A LAG
      
      5) QUAD CORE PROCESSOR AT THE BACK, SO EXPECT THE PHONE TO HEAT UP SOMETIMES, BUT WE NEED NOT EVEN DIP IT IN WATER AS SOME OF OUR FRIENDS HAVE SUGGESTED. JUST STOP WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING FOR TWO MINUTES AND THE TEMPERATURE IS BACK TO NORMAL.
      
      6) THE SOUND IS MORE CLEAR THAN LOUD. A BLESSING FOR THOSE MUSIC FANS WHO ARE INTO ACOUSTICS BECAUSE THE QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD.
      
      7) RECORDED A FEW VIDEOS AND TOOK A FEW PICS ON THE CAMERA AND I AM IMPRESSED EVEN WITH THE SECONDARY CAM (2MP). I NEED NOT SAY ANYTHING ON THE REAR CAM (13MP)
      
      8) THE PHONE HAS A RICH, ROYAL APPEARANCE WITH GLASSY FINISH. MY WHITE DEVICE HAS MADE MANY A HEADS TURN IN THE DIRECTION OF MY PHONE.
      
      
      IF YOU WANT TO OWN A SMARTPHONE, OWN SONY XPERIA Z"
Xperia Z,5,"HI GUYS. I PERSONALLY OWN THIS PRODUCT AND THE BELOW ARE MY OBSERVATIONS.
      
      
      1) I AM GETTING A VERY GOOD BATTERY BACK INSPITE OF USING 5-6 HOURS OF INTERNET, 2 HOURS OF MUSIC LISTENING.
      
      
      2) COMING TO CAMERA QUALITY, IT IS SOOPERB. ESPECIALLY THE FRONT CAMERA IS VERY GOOD FOR SKYPE, GOOGLE TALK ETC.
      
      
      3) SOME PEOPLE SAYING THE EMAILING IS NOT FAST. BUT THAT IS INCORRECT, I HAVE CONFIGURED 3 MAILS IN MY MOBILE AND SOME TIMES BEFORE MY LAPTOP OUTLOOK, THE MOBILE EMAIL ALERTS WHEN THERE IS A NEW E-MAIL.
      
      
      4) IN COMPARISON OF HTC, I HAVE SEEN HTC MODELS - AFTER 1 YEAR OF SERVICE, POOR IN TOUCH AND SLOWNESS IN OPERATING SYSTEM.
      
      
      5) COMPARING TO S4, I WILL DEFINITELY SUGGEST SONY Z. WITH S3 IT IS NOT COMPARABLE BECAUSE BOTH ARE IN DIFFERENT SEGMENTS. IF STILL WANTS TO COMPARE, SONY HAS THE ADVANTAGE IN WATER PROOF, DUST PROOF AND TOUCH.
      
      
      6) THE TOUCH OF SONY IS THE BEST COMPARED TO S3 OR WHATEVER THE PHONE.
      
      
      7) IF YOU HAVE ACTIVATED 3G OVER SONY XPERIA Z MOBILE, THEN YOU WILL FEEL REALLY GOOD.
      
      
      8) WITH THE PROCESSER IT HAS, I HAVE NEVER FELT THAT OPERATING OF APPS IS SLOW.
      
      
      9) I ADMIT, THE PHONE WILL TAKE 2 SECONDS TO START OF THE CAMERA.
      
      
      IN OVERHAUL, THE PHONE IS REALLY AWESOME."

      THANK YOU!!!"
Xperia Z,5,"I AM SHOCKED TO SEE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, I MEAN ARE PEOPLE REALLY SUCH BIG IDIOTS?
      
      
      THERE IS NOT EVEN A SINGLE PHONE WITH SUCH SUCH FEATURES AT 38K NEAREST ACETONE AND S4 BOTH 40K+ BUT HERE U GET WATERPROOF AND DUSTPROOF HARDWARE WHICH NO PHONE OFFERS. THAT MEANS THIS WILL LAST!!!! AND ABOUT CONS
      
      
      BAD SPEAKER? CHECK OUT THE HEADPHONES. AND WIDTH SONY'S SOUND ENHANCEMENTS THERE IS NOT EVEN A SINGLE PHONE THAT CAN MATCH WITH THE PRELOADED ENVIRONMENTAL SOUND CONFIGS.
      
      
      HEATING UP? WELL EVERY HIGH END PHONE SUFFERS AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BURN YOUR HAND. IT'S QUITE BEARABLE. AND NOT A PROBLEM.
      
      
      NOT 4.2? I DON'T CARE BECAUSE MY PHONE IS DELIVERING EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE UNDER 4.1 AN. TRUST ME U WILL NOT EVEN FEEL THE NEED OF 4.2. THIS PHONE IS CURRENTLY THE BEST PHONE EVEN IPHONE CANNOT MATCH IT.
      
      
      IF YOU BUY THIS PHONE IT'S A ONE TIME INVESTMENT FOR FIVE YEARS ALSO SONY GIVES UPDATES AT LEAST IT'S BETTER AT THIS ASPECT THAN STUPID SAMSUNG. I AM PROUD THAT I OWN THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!"
Xperia Z,5,"I AM USING THE SONY XPERIA Z FOR MORE THAN A MONTH NOW, AND MY REVIEW IS THE RESULT OF THAT USER EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      WHAT'S HOT:  THE IMPRESSIVE FULL HD SCREEN.  PHOTOS AND VIDEOS RENDER BETTER ON THIS SCREEN THAT ON THE COMPUTER MONITOR.  A RECENT FIRMWARE UPDATE THAT ENABLES CALIBRATING THE SCREEN WARMTH HAS IMPROVED MATTERS EVEN FURTHER.  WHILE PLAYING GAMES, I USE THE ""SCREEN FILTER"" APP TO FURTHER DARKEN THE SCREEN.
      
      
      WHAT'S NOT: THE ABYSMAL LIFE OF THE BATTERY.  WHILE IT MAY BE 2300 MAH, WHEN HANDLING HD GAMES, THE DRAIN IS SIGNIFICANT.  WHILE THIS IS DUE TO THE POWER CONSUMPTION OF THE FULL HD SCREEN, IT MEANS THAT ONE NEEDS TO CART AN ENERGY BANK ALONG, IF YOU ARE USING THE PHONE CONTINUOUSLY THROUGH THE DAY RATHER THAN INTERMITTENTLY.
      
      
      POINT-BY-POINT:
      
      
      [1]  THE DUST AND WATER RESISTANCE FEATURES OF THIS PHONE ARE SUPERB.  I ACTUALLY USED THIS PHONE OUTDOORS DURING A DOWNPOUR FOR PHOTOGRAPHY.  WHILE IT DIDN'T GET ALL RAINY WET, THERE WAS WATER EXPOSURE, SO YES, THIS FEATURE DID COME HANDY.  ACTUALLY, THE EXISTENCE OF THIS FEATURE ENCOURAGED ME TO USE IT FOR PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE RAIN!
      
      
      [2]  I CAME FROM AN AMOLED SCREEN TO THIS SCREEN, SO I SET THE SCREEN TINT SLIGHTLY BLUISH.  IT SURELY HOLDS ITS OWN.  FULL HD VIDEOS LOOK GREAT ON THIS 5 INCH SCREEN, WITH THE BRAVIA ENGINE ENABLED.
      
      
      [3]  THE LOUDSPEAKER ON THIS PHONE HAS RECEIVED CRITICISM FOR ITS PERFORMANCE.  IN MY EXPERIENCE, IN A QUIET PLACE, ONE HAS TO ACTUALLY TONE DOWN THE VOLUME.  BUT, WITH CITY NOISE, PERHAPS THEY COULD IMPROVE ON THE VOLUME.  FOR MOST PURPOSES, THE SPEAKER WORKS; BUT FOR GOOD BASS YOU WILL NEED TO USE THE EARPIECE.
      
      
      [4]  THE IN-EAR HEADPHONES ARE GOOD.  THERE IS ALSO AN ADDITIONAL SET OF HEADPHONES THAT CAME FREE BACK THEN, [THAT OFFER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED], AND THOSE GIVE AN EVEN BETTER MUSICAL EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      [5]  FOR THE FIRST DAY OR TWO, I USED THE FREE PHONE CASING.  BUT, THE PHONE'S PURPLE BODY COLOUR FELT SO RICH WHEN I GLANCED AT ITS TOP WHILE LOOKING AT MY SHIRT POCKET, IT CONTRASTED WITH THE FEEBLE WHITE OF THE CASE, AND I'M NOT USING THAT CASE ANY MORE.
      
      
      [6]  THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHONE IS GOOD, ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE PLACED IT ON THE DESK.  ITS NOT VERY HEAVY EITHER, AND I CAN EASILY HOLD IT IN ONE HAND.
      
      
      [7]  THE QUAD-CORE PROCESSOR MEANS THAT EVERYTHING WORKS IN A SNAP.  WHILE THE NERDS MIGHT COMPLAIN THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE ""LATEST"" JELLYBEAN, WHAT IT HAS IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR EVERYTHING.  THE 2 GB RAM ALSO SPEEDS UP THINGS.
      
      
      [8]  WHILE INTERNATIONALLY, SONY PROVIDES FREE SUBSCRIPTION TO ""VIDEOS UNLIMITED"", IN INDIA THEY SEEM TO HAVE SUBSTITUTED THAT WITH ""SONY LIV"" WHICH BASICALLY PROVIDES RERUNS OF SHOWS ON SONY TV CHANNELS.  I TRIED OUT ONLY A COUPLE OF THEM, AND BOTH WERE UNIFORMLY POOR IN VIDEO CAPABILITY, AND VERY LO-RES TO BOOT.  THERE IS ALSO A TEMP FREE SUBSCRIPTION TO SONY MUSIC, ANOTHER APP IN DEVELOPMENT.  ITS ""TOP SONGS"" LISTING IS AT VARIANCE WITH THE HOTTEST ITEMS ON MUSIC CHANNELS, AND ITS SEARCH FEATURE DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO KEY IN TEXT.  INSTEAD YOU HAVE TO SEARCH ALPHABETICALLY, WHICH GETS TO BE VERY CUMBERSOME.
      
      
      [9]  THE CAMERA ON THIS PHONE IS SUPERB, AS WELL AS THE FULL HD VIDEO CAMERA.  THERE IS A SUPERIOR AUTO MODE ON THIS CAMERA, WHICH TAKES BETTER SHOTS THAN THE ONES I TRIED WITH MANUAL SETTINGS.  BUT THEN, I'M NOT AN EXPERT PHOTOGRAPHER.
      
      
      [10]  CALL QUALITY IS GOOD, DATA TRANSFER IS NOT A PROBLEM.
      
      
      [11]  THE FM RADIO IS GOOD WITH SUPERB STEREO; BUT THEIR FM RADIO APP IS WANTING.  THE ONE ON MY PREVIOUS SAMSUNG GALAXY S HAD A BETTER INTERFACE AND USABILITY FEATURES.
      
      
      [12]  THE BEST FEATURE ON THIS PHONE IS ITS NEAR STOCK-ANDROID THAT ENABLES INSTANT START-UP.  COMING FROM THE ENDLESS MINUTES WAITING FOR THE SAMSUNG TO COME TO LIFE, THIS WAS A REFRESHING CHANGE, AS THE PHONE IS READY TO USE LITERALLY WITHIN SECONDS.
      
      
      [13]  SO, WE COME TO THE END OF THE LINE, AND THAT IS THE AWFUL BATTERY.  PERHAPS THERE IS SOME GENUINE PROBLEM IN THEIR BATTERIES, OR MAYBE THE FULL HD SCREEN IS A GAS GUZZLER; BUT, AT ANY RATE, YOU WILL NEED TO CARRY ALONG A LARGISH ENERGY BANK IF YOU ARE USING THIS PHONE THROUGHOUT THE DAY WITH ITS SCREEN ON.  THERE IS A STAMINA MODE ON THE PHONE, BUT IF YOU ARE USING WIFI, AND GAMES, AND WHAT NOT, ITS NOT GOING TO BE OF ANY HELP.  IF YOU ARE WILLING TO SHUT THESE DOWN, AND USE THE PHONE IN DUMB MODE, JUST FOR CALLING, THEN ONE SINGLE CHARGE WILL RUN FOR 4 DAYS AND 21 HOURS.
      
      
      THE MANUFACTURERS CLAIM A 550 HOUR STANDBY TIME, WHICH IS MISLEADING, BECAUSE MY TESTS INDICATE SOMETHING IN THE RANGE OF 270-330 HOURS AT BEST.  THE STAMINA MODE WILL GIVE 120 HOURS AT MOST.  SO, THEY EITHER NEED TO REVIEW THE DATA IN THEIR WHITE-PAPER, OR GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD ON MAKING THE BATTERY SWAPPABLE/ HOT-SWAPPABLE.
      
      
      SO, THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE.  WOULD I BUY A SONY XPERIA Z AGAIN?  MOST DEFINITELY YES, DESPITE THAT POOR BATTERY.  AND THE PURPLE COLOUR DOES LOOK KEWL."
Xperia Z,5,"I AM USING XPERIA Z SINCE 2 MONTHS. RECENTLY I UPDATED MY PHONE USING SONY PC COMPANION. AFTER THIS LATEST SOFTWARE UPDATE FROM SONY, BATTERY BACK UP HAS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. ALSO NO HEATING ISSUES NOW."
Xperia Z,5,"I BOUGHT SONY XPERIA Z FROM FILPKART. I ORDERED IT AS PREORDER. AFTER 15DAY USE I AM REVIEWING THIS PRODUCT. BECAUSE AFTER JUST GETTING A PRODUCT YOU CANT UNDERSTAND A PRODUCTS EFFICIENCY, YOU HAVE TO USE IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.
      
      SO HERE IT GOES.
      
      
      1.LOOK
      
      
      IF I TALK ABOUT THE LOOK OF THE PHONE, THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER SEEN. MOST ELEGANT PHONE. IT HAS A MAZIK IN ITS LOOK, THAT WILL CHARM YOU.
      
      
      2. HARDWARE
      
      
      AS MUCH I KNOW IT HAS MORE OR LESS SAME HARDWARE FOR NEXUS 4, AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE, THEN SEE SPECS IN FLIPKART, ITS WRITTEN PERFECT
      
      
      3. PERFORMANCE
      
      
      AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF USE I CAN SAY IT IS SMOOTH LIKE A BUTTER. MEANS I PLAY GAMES, SUDDENLY GOT MAIL, AND JUST TAPING THE HOME BUTTON GO TO THE MAIL ,THEN CHECK THE CHAT IF I GOT ANY, THEN CHECK WHATSAPP IF GOT ANY MESSAGE. BUT BELIEVE ME THERE IS NO LAG. BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IF YOU ARE USING ANY WIDGET THAT HAS A ACTION FROM THE NET(EG - SONY SOCIAL LIFE, WEATHER WIDGET) THEN THERE IS A VERY VERY VERY LITTLE DELAY YOU MAY FIND, BUT NOT EVERY TIME, AFTER THE USAGE WHAT I SAID ABOVE U MAY FIND, BUT SURELY FOR THE ONE TIME, AND IF ARE NOT GEEKY OR EXPERT YOU MAY NOT FIND THAT, TRUST ME THAT WILL NOT BOTHER YOU. AS I WANT A TO SHARE MY VIEWS PERFECTLY, SO I AM WRITING EACH AND EVERYTHING WHAT  I FOUND.
      
      
      BUT WHAT I FOUND AS A LAG IN CAMERA, YES IT TAKE TIME TO LUNCH THE CAMERA OFTEN(NOT TOO MUCH BUT 2SEC-3 SEC). AND SOMETIMES TO SAVE A PIC. BUT AS I SAID FOR THE FIRST TIME U USE IT AFTER CLEANING THE CACHE OR SWITCHING OFF/ON THE PHONE, BUT AFTER THAT ITS TOO MUCH SMOOTH.
      
      
      3. PLAYING GAMES
      
      
      THERE IS NO ISSUE WITH PLAYNIG GAMES, AND AFTER PLAYING GAMES YOU WILL NOT FOUIND ANY LAG OR ISSUE WITH OTHER APPS.
      
      
      4. DISPLAY
      
      
      JUST AWESOME. YOU CAN SEE EVERY DETAILS OF A PIC AND HD VIDEOS ARE JUST VIVID AND REALISTIC. THANKS TO BRAVIA ENGINE 2. AND FOR THE VIEWING ANGLE, IT WILL NOT BOTHER YOU REALLY , WHAT I CAN SAY ON FULL BRIGHTNESS(WHO WANTS TO DIM THE BRIGHTNESS OF A FULL HD PHONE YAAR)  YOU HAVE NO ISSUE TO VIEW IT IN FULL SUNLIGHT. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO WRK OTHER THAN TO FIND A BAD, THEY SAY THAT IT HAS ISSUE WITH THE DISPLAY.
      
      
      5. CAMERA
      
      
      THE CAMERA IS AWESOME ON FULL LIGHT, MEANS JUST GREAT, THE COLOR REPRODUCTION IS GREAT, BUT NOT THAT GOOD IN LOW LIGHT(BUT BETTER FROM OTHERS) VIDEO QUALITY IS VERY GOOD IN BOTH CONDITION. THE  HDR VIDEO IS REALLY GREAT. MORAL THE CAMERA IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR DAY TO DAY LIFE. ON DAY LIGHT OR IN NORMAL LIGHT THE PICS YOU TAKE, YOU WILL LOVW THEM, MAY WANT TO KISS THEM AND FEEL PROUD.
      
      
      6. BATTERY
      
      
      AS ITS A SMARTPHONE, IT DRAINS BATTERY VARY QUICKLY, BUT THANKS TO THE STAMINA MODE AND AUTO WIFI(LOCATION BASED WIFI) THAT WILL SAVE YOUR PHONE BATTERY , AND MAY HELP YOU TO CONCENTRATE IN YOUR WORK ,BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET ANY UPDATE TILL YOU UNLOCK IT, BUT CALLS AND SMS YOU WILL GET, OR YOU HAVE OPTION THE APPS YOU WANT TO RUN ON BACKGROUND. THE BATTERY LAST LONG FOR 12H WITH A TYPICAL USE(2/3H - GAMING, 3G OR WIFI FOR 4H, SONGS 2H, AND OTHER CALLS FOR 2H ,AND 10-20SMS )
      
      
      7. HEATING
      
      
      YES IT WILL GET HEAT, AFTER A 1H CONTINUOUS USE(GAMING AND INTERNET USE).
      
      
      8. TOUGHNESS , WATERPROOF AND DUSTPROOF
      
      
      SORRY TO SAY BUT I DONT WANT TO TRY TO DROP IT THIS BEAUTIFUL PHONE TO TEST THE TOUGHNESS.
      
      ABOUT THE WATERPROOF , I WASHED THE PHONE AFTER TAKING HOLI PICS AND ITS QUITE FUNNY THE THE PHONE IS OK. I NEVER IN PLACE WITH LOTS DUST.
      
      
      CONCLUSION
      
      
      I AM JUST VERY HAPPY WITH THE PHONE, AND I LOVE TO USE IT IN DAY TO DAY LIFE."
Xperia Z,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE 10 DAYS BACK &AMP; I'M LOVING THE PHONE EACH MOMENT I'M USING IT. AT THE INITIAL STAGE I WAS TOTALLY CONFUSED BETWEEN Z &AMP; ZL. AND FINALLY I DECIDED TO GO FOR XPERIA Z.
      
      - AS USUAL SONY SHOWED AGAIN THERE DISPLAY CLARITY, BRAVIA ENGINE II DOES THE JOB VERY WELL &AMP; 1080P 5"" SCREEN IS AWESOME TO USE. I LOVES TO WATCH MOVIES &AMP; PICS IN THIS PHONE.
      
      - HEADPHONE QUALITY IS ALSO VERY GOOD WITH DEEP BASS &AMP; CLARITY.
      
      -CAMERA QUALITY IS GREAT MAINLY HDR MODE..
      
      -CALL QUALITY IS EXCELLENT.
      
      -UI IS REFRESHED AND EASY TO USE.
      
      -NFC IS FUN TO USE WITH MY SONY SMART TAGS.
      
      -I M USING 64GB(FAT32) MEMORY CARD WITH THIS PHONE,SO MY TOTAL STORAGE IS NOW 80GB AND SONY IS OFFERING 50GB CLOUD STORAGE FOR LIFE,BUT I HAVEN'T USED CLOUD STORAGE TILL NOW.
      
      -I M ALSO USING XPERIA Z CHARGING DOCK WHICH HELP ME TO WATCH MOVIES CONTINUOUSLY WITHOUT ANY WORRIES,MAINLY  XPERIA Z CHARGING DOCK IS USED AS A  WIRELESS CHARGING.
      
      ALL THE ABOVE COMMENTS ARE ONLY MY PERSONAL OPINION AS PER MY USAGE."
Xperia Z,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AS I WANTED SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE REGULAR CROP OF SMARTPHONES LIKE APPLE AND SAMSUNG AND I MUST SAY THIS PHONE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.
      
      
      FIRST UP, THE LOOKS, THE PHONE IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL WITH A GLASS CASING THAT PUTS IT INTO A CLASS OF ITS OWN. THEN THERE IS THE SCREEN, FULL HD RESOLUTION IS SUPERB. MOVIES, PICTURES AND VIDEOS ARE AS GOOD AS YOU WOULD VIEW THEM ON YOUR HD TELEVISION AT HOME.
      
      
      THEN THERE IS THE WALKMAN FEATURE THAT SONY IS SO FAMOUS FOR. IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF SONGS AND MOVIES ON YOUR EXISTING SD CARD, THE PHONE CAN DOWNLOAD ALL THE ALBUM ART AND RELATED INFORMATION FROM THE INTERNET, THIS IS ONE FEATURE I JUST LOVE.
      
      
      ALL THE APPS AND INBUILT FUNCTIONS HAVE A BEAUTIFUL INTERFACE THAT ADDS TO THE PHONE'S PREMIUM FEEL.
      
      
      CONS: WELL I WASN'T TO IMPRESSED WITH THE INBUILT SPEAKERS. OLDER SONY ERRICSON WALKMAN PHONE HAD GREAT SPEAKERS AND WITH THIS YOU ARE FORCED TO USE THE HEADPHONES IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY SOUND.
      
      
      OTHER THAN THAT FOR 38K THE PHONE IS A VERY GOOD BUY CONSIDERING THE COMPETITION NOT ONLY LOOKS WAY TOO ORDINARY AND IS AT LEAST 5K MORE EXPENSIVE."
Xperia Z,5,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR LESSER PRICE IN RETAIL SHOP, AND I AM LOVING ITS PERFORMANCE.THE LOOK AND FEEL IN THE HAND IS JUST AWESOME. I BOUGHT IT FOR 36K!! WITH HEADPHONE
      
      
      THE THINGS WHICH I LIKE ABOUT MY Z
      
      
      1) BRILLIANT 5 INCH 1080P DISPLAY, 441PPI!!
      
      2) CAM IS BRILLIANT EVEN IN LOW LIGHT THANKS TO EXMOR-RS SENSOR, COULD HAV STILL BE BETTER HOPEFULLY IN NXT UPDATE TO 4.2.2 ,MAY BE FIXED!!
      
      3) SOUND QUALITY IS NICE, DUE TO THE SPEAKER POSITION, SAVES ME NOT TO PUT UPSIDE DOWN, AND NO PROBLEMS WHILE HOLDING OR PLAYING GAMES, V LL ADJUST TO CRISP SOUND
      
      4) S4 HAS SCORED IN ANTUTU 25000 AND Z BEING QUAD CORE HAS SCORED 22000, REALLY GUYS U WONT FEEL DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE AT ALL
      
      5) 2 GB RAM!!!!
      
      6) FM IS AVAILABLE BUT IN S4 NO!!!
      
      7) FRONT CAM IS GOOD AS WELL 2.2 MP!!
      
      8) HAS MICROSD SUPPORT TILL 64 GB (FAT 32) WITH INTERNAL 11GB USUABLE,AS HTC ONE DOESNT HAVE SLOT AT ALL!!
      
      9) THE POWER BUTTON AND VOLUME ROCKER IS VERY HANDY, I HAD NOTE 1 WHICH TROUBLED ME IN OPERATING VOLUME ROCKER
      
      10) BATTERY COULD HAVE BETTER BUT ITS DECENT AND CHARGES SOON !! A GR8 +
      
      11) WATER AND DUST PROOF COMES HANDY, V ARE PAYING 35K+ FOR PHONES AND THIS FEATURES WORTH THE PRICE
      
      12) ALL PORTS COVERED, MAKES DUST RESISTANT AND AVOIDS CLEANING WITH COTTON, AS I DID FOR MY NOTE :(
      
      13) SMALL APPS COMES IN VERY HANDY, WITH SNAPPY PERFORMANCE
      
      
      IT HAS BAGGED MANY AWARDS AND GOOD CRITICS COMMENT, CHECK IN WIKI
      
      
      FINALLY I M SATISFIED BY THE DEVICE AND 100% SUPPORT WITH THE SONY MW1 BLUETOOTH HEADSET. GO FOR IT GUYS PICK YO Z, U WILL BE SATISFIED FOR SURE"
Xperia Z,5,"I DID NOT BY THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART BUT THE PHONE IS JUST AWESOME
      
      SUPERB HD SCREEN
      
      SUPERB CAMERA (VERY VIVID AND REAL COLOURS)
      
      VERY FAST 1.5 GHZ PROCESSOR
      
      BASICALLY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PHONE IN THE MARK RIGHT NOW
      
      WITH THE HTC ONE AND THE GALAXY S4 COMING IN IT STILL IS BETTER BECAUSE OF ITS PRICE AND
      
      BEST OF ALL RIGID BODY WHICH IS DUST AND WATER RESISTANT
      
      I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO EVERYONE AS IT TAKES ALL THE ROUGH USAGE AND STILL DELIVERS SUPERB PERFORMANCE"
Xperia Z,5,"I DO NOT KNOW WHAT EVERYONE IS COMPLAINING ABOUT. THE PHONE IS ONE OF THE BEST I'VE SEEN
      
      - VERY FAST
      
      - VERY SMOOTH
      
      - EXPERIENCE CLOSEST TO AOSP
      
      
      FLIPKART OFFERED THE BEST DEAL SO FAR. GOT THE PURPLE EDITION AT JUST ABOVE 36,000/-
      
      
      THE FREEBIES ARE GOOD TOO :)"
Xperia Z,5,"I GOT ENTIRE TECH DETAILS FROM NET &AMP; NEWS PAPERS. YESTERDAY (17.03.13) I SAW IT, TOUCHED IT IN A SONY SHOW ROOM &AMP; FALL IN LOVE. THE UNBELIEVABLE CRAFTSMANSHIP, THE FEATURES, THE DECENT LOOK, THE SMOOTH TOUCH SCREEN &AMP; GLOWING BRIGHTNESS REALLY MADE ME FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. FOR LONG, I WAS AWAITING A MODEL LIKE THIS &AMP; FINALLY ORDERED IT AT NIGHT. IT IS EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED TO ME BY 27.03.13 &AMP; EAGERLY WAITING FOR THE DAY.... IT'S OUT OF STOCK AT FLIPKART TODAY... I HOPE I WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED  &AMP; POSITIVELY BE DELIVERED BY 27.03.13. ..."
Xperia Z,5,"I HAD XPERIA S BEFORE NW I'M USING Z SERIOUSLY GUYS ITS REALLY GORGEOUS AND FANTASTIC AT PERFORMANCE
      
      
      IN XPERIA S IT HAD LITTLE LESS BATTERY BUT THIS IS AWESOME
      
      
      AND IT'S HAVN A MEMORY EXPANDABLE FEATURE WHICH WAS NT THERE IS XPERIA S THATS AN ADVANTAGE
      
      
      I THINK 38K WORTH IT"
Xperia Z,5,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS BEAUTY AND IT IS REALLY A BEAST..WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!I LOVE IT..SCREEN,CAMERA,PROCESSOR,GAMING EVERYTHING IS JUST WOW!!SOUND QUALITY USING GOOD HEADPHONES IS JUST AWESOME..GOOD BATTERY LIFE AND A HUGE SCREEN..JUST PERFECT FOR WATCHING MOVIES AND GAMING TOO.."
Xperia Z,5,"I HAVE BOUGHT ONE(BLACK) AND AM EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH ITS OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND ITS PREMIUM LOOKS AND FEEL.
      
      
      POSITIVES -
      
      
      SCREEN WITH SONY MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE2 -- PROBABLY THE BEST IN ITS PRICE RANGE. I WATCH MOVIES WITH THE HEADSET ON, ITS A REAL EXPERIENCE...
      
      AUDIO -- EXCELLENT AUDIO QUALITY, SUPPLIED HEADSET VERY GOOD
      
      CAMERA - 13MP WITH 1080 P VIDEO RECORDING --- EXCELLENT !!
      
      INTERFACE - SIMPLE AND ATTRACTIVE AND FUN TO USE-- LOVE USING IT
      
      GREAT VALUE
      
      WATER AND DUST PROOF.I TOOK MANY PHOTOS IN HOLI WITHOUT ANY TENSION.
      
      NEGATIVE-
      
      MMMMMM NOTHING TILL NOW.
      
      GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY PHONE."
Xperia Z,5,"I HAVE THIS PHONE SINCE LAST 1 MONTH AND NOT EXPERIENCED A SINGLE PROBLEM IN IT. ALL IS GREAT ABOUT THIS PHONE BUT MOST APPEALING IS ITS LOOKS AND POWER.
      
      
      I RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ALL WHO WANT TO BUY A HIGH END SMARTPHONE."
Xperia Z,5,"I HAVE USED THIS PHONE FOR A AROUND A COUPLE OF DAYS AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAY THAT SPEAKER GETS IN THE WAY IS BULLSHIT AS THE PHONE IS SO LARGE THAT YOU CANT PLAY TEMPLE RUN OR ANY PORTRAIT GAME ONE HANDED AND THE SPEAKER NEVER GETS IN WAY SPEAKER QUALITY IS GOOD AND THE BEATS ARE AUDIBLE AND IT IS ALSO LOUD THE DISPLAY IS GORGEOUS AND I LOVE IT BUT ONLY THING I HAVE COMPLAINT ABOUT IS THAT THE BATTERY DRAINS VERY QUICKLY AND LAST FOR AROUND 7 HOURS OF INTENSE USE BUT IT ALSO CHARGES VERY QUICKLY IN 2.5 HOURS
      
      OVERALL VERY GOOD PHONE SLEEK STYLISH AND ELEGANT AND ALSO THE BLACK COLOR LOOKS IS BLACK VIOLET
      
      I"
Xperia Z,5,"I PRE-ORDERED MY Z ON FLIPKART AND AM USING IT FROM A WEEK. IT IMPRESSED ME ON ALL FRONTS SO FAR. I UPGRADED FROM GINGERBREAD AND JB LOOKS COOL. BUT WHAT I STILL COULDN'T FIGURE OUT IS WHETHER MY C6602 IS CAPABLE OF LTE? I GUESS, NOT. I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE HAPPY IF THE CHOICE WAS GIVEN AT THE TIME OF PLACING THE ORDER TO CHOOSE C6603(LTE), AS I LOVE MY PHONE TOO MUCH NOW THAT I DONT WANT TO UPGRADE IN NEAR FUTURE....:)!"
Xperia Z,5,"I PURCHASED THE XPERIA Z FROM A STORE AFTER SPENDING HOURS LOOKING THROUGH THE SPECS ON FLIPKART - A DECISION I REGRETTED QUICKLY WHEN I REALIZED THEY ONLY HAD THE LEATHER CASE IN WHITE (WHICH REALLY IS NOT USE WHEN THE PHONE YOU'RE BUYING AS JET BLACK).
      
      
      ANYWAY...I HAVE USED SONY PHONES BEFORE, FROM THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE SONY ERICSSON AND APPLE WAS YET TO LAUNCH THE IPHONE. MY EXPERIENCE WITH THAT UN-SMART PHONE WAS PRETTY GOOD (STREETS AHEAD OF THE MOTOROLA AND SAMSUNG PHONE I HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO USE), AND SO WHEN I TOO GOT ON THE ANDROID BANDWAGON, IT WAS WITH AN XPERIA NEO V (WHICH I DID PURCHASE FROM FLIPKART).
      
      
      I DID CONSIDER SEVERAL OPTIONS WHEN LOOKING TO BUY A NEW PHONE, AND LOOKED VERY CLOSELY AT THE SAMSUNG RANGE (GRAND, S3, NOTE2), BEFORE BEING DAZZLED BY THE MONOLITHIC BEAUTY OF THE XPERIA Z, SO REMINISCENT OF 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (AND THE SPECS, OF COURSE. I'M NO LUDDITE)
      
      
      ANYWAY, TO GET DOWN TO IT:
      
      THE GOOD:
      
      1. THE DEVICE IS A THING OF BEAUTY. THE PHOTOS DO NOT DO JUSTICE TO HOW THE XPERIA Z LOOKS IN THE HAND. WHEN YOU SEE IT, YOU ARE LEFT WITH NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT THIS IS A PREMIUM PRODUCT. NOT SINCE THE IPHONE 4 HAS A PHONE BEEN SO OBVIOUSLY CLASSY.
      
      2. THE SCREEN IS BEAUTIFUL. I KNOW, THE SPECS ALONE INDICATE IT TO BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION, BUT SEEING IS BELIEVING. IF YOU LIKE YOUR SCREEN TO LOOK LIKE AN EPISODE FROM A CHILDREN'S CARTOON, YOU MAY PREFER THE SAMSUNG PHONES, BUT IF ELEGANCE IS WHAT YOU STRIVE FOR, THE XPERIA Z HAS IT IN DOLLOPS.
      
      3. PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN STELLAR SO FAR. I'VE BEEN USING THE PHONE FOR TWO WEEKS AND AM A VERY HEAVY USER. THERE HASN'T BEEN A HINT OF LAG.
      
      4. THE CAMERA HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL IN GOOD LIGHTING CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT USED IT IN DIM LIGHTING YET.
      
      
      BAD:
      
      1. SOUND VOLUME IS ON THE LOWER SIDE AND THE SPEAKER IS AWKWARDLY PLACED, MAKING IT EASY TO COVER WITH YOUR HAND.
      
      2. THE SCREEN ATTRACTS SMUDGE MARKS LIKE FISH ATTRACTS CATS. HAVING SAID THAT, YOU CAN JUST WIPE THE SCREEN SMOOTH IF YOU HAVE A SOFT SCREEN CLOTH, SO THAT'S NOT REALLY A DISADVANTAGE.
      
      3. GLASS SURFACES ON BOTH SIDES = HIGH POTENTIAL FOR SCRATCHING. FOR ALL ITS RUGGEDNESS ONE ENDS UP USING IT VERY CAREFULLY FOR THIS REASON ALONE.
      
      4. BRILLIANT AS IT IS, THE PRICE COULD HAVE DONE WITH A HAIRCUT OF A COUPLE OF GRAND IN ORDER TO REALLY GRAB THE MARKET. AS IT STANDS, IT'S UNLIKELY TO TAKE SERIOUS MARKET SHARE FROM THE SAMSUNG-LOVING MASSES.
      
      
      UGLY:
      
      WELL, NOTHING REALLY, EXCEPT THAT, THANKS TO THE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN, EVERYONE YOU SEE WANTS TO DUMP THE PHONE INTO WATER TO SEE IF IT'S REALLY WATER-RESISTANT.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A TOP-OF-THE-LINE PHONE, THE Z IS PROBABLY THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY IN THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT. SINCE SONY DOES NOT TYPICALLY CUT PRICES TOO MUCH, THIS IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY TO BUY."
Xperia Z,5,"I RECEIVED THE PHONE FROM FLIPKART 3 DAYS BACK. BUSINESS AS USUAL, THEIR SERVICE IS VERY GOOD.
      
      
      EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE IS EXPECTED FROM FLAGSHIP PHONES.
      
      SO, I WOULD LIST THE CONS FIRST: I FOUND THE CAMERA TO BE OUTRIGHT TERRIBLE. SURPRISING CONSIDERING MOST OF THE TOP MANUFACTURERS INCLUDING APPLE AND SAMSUNG USE A SONY CENSOR. THE IMAGE QUALITY IS SO BAD THAT IT CAN BE A DEAL BREAKER FOR THE ONES WHO CLICK A LOT OF PICS ON PHONE. HOPE, SONY COMES OUT WITH A SOLUTION FOR THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
      
      
      NOW THE PROS:
      
      1)THE DISPLAY IS VERY CRISP DETAILED AND NOT VERY REFLECTIVE. IMAGES AND VIDEOS AND TEXT ARE AMAZINGLY CLEAR, BUT THE DISPLAY MAY NOT BE VISUALLY APPEALING OVER IPS AND CURVED GLASS DISPLAYS. I PREFER THIS FOR DAILY USE (MORE KIND WITH THE EYES) OVER EYE POPPING DISPLAYS AND ONES WITH A LOT OF COLOR SATURATION.
      
      2) THE BUILD FEELS SOLID. I DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO CHECK IF IT CAN WITHSTAND FALLS YET.
      
      3) THE PERFORMANCE IS VERY SNAPPY. I HAVE USED IT HEAVILY IN THE PAST THREE DAYS. I DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY LAG OR HANG. ITS DIRECT COMPETITORS LIKE S4 AND ONE WILL HAVE BETTER PROCESSORS, BUT IF SHEER BENCHMARKS ARE NOT YOUR CONCERN, THIS SPEED SHOULD SUFFICE.
      
      4)THE INTERFACE IS MINIMAL YET VERY POLISHED (AS POLISHED AS THE PHONE IS STYLISH) MAKING THE EXPERIENCE OF OPERATING THE PHONE A JOY.
      
      5) THE AUDIO QUALITY IS VERY GOOD BUT NOT LOUD ON SPEAKERS. THE VOICE CALL QUALITY IS VERY GOOD.
      
      6) IT MAY NOT BOAST SPECIAL FUTURISTIC FEATURES APART FROM IP 55 AND 57 CERTIFICATION, BUT IT HAS APPS AND TWEAKS TO ENHANCE BATTERY MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMIZE PHONE THAT COULD BE USEFUL TO AT LEAST A FEW IN ONE OR THE OTHER WAY.
      
      7) ONE FULL BATTERY CHARGE CAN BE SUFFICIENT FOR MORE THAN A DAY BUT LESS THAN 2 DAYS WHICH IS RESPECTABLE FOR SMARTPHONES. IN THE LITTLE TIME I SPENT, I AM HAPPY WITH THE SEEMINGLY ABOVE AVERAGE BATTERY.
      
      
      I READ ONLINE THAT THERE ARE PHONE DEATH AND BATTERY HEATING ISSUES, WHICH I DID NOT FACE AND HENCE, I CANNOT COMMENT ON THEM.
      
      
      SUMMARY: THE EXPERIENCE IS SOLID DESPITE NOT HAVING A MILLION EXTRA FEATURES THAT IS THE NORM FOR FLAGSHIP PHONES. THE PHONE IS STYLISH NOT ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE BUT ALSO ON THE INTERFACE FRONT. DISPLAY AND CAMERA QUALITY ARE I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS THAT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS MAY HAVE TO TAKE A CALL ON BEFORE MAKING THE DECISION. REST OF THE PHONE IS A SUPERB PACKAGE."
Xperia Z,5,"I WAITED FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 BUT SERIOUS IT WAS NOT WORTH THE WAIT , THIS HANDSET REALLY IS THE BEST BUY . CLOSE YOUR EYES AND GO FOR IT , INR 36000 FOR THIS FONE IS REALLY WORTH EVERY PENNY .  MY PERSONAL ADVICE TO PEOPLE SCEPTICAL IN BUYING THIS PHONE IS GO TO YOUR NEAREST SONY DEALER GET THE FEEL AND I AM SURE YOUR VIEWS WILL BE DIFFERENT ."
Xperia Z,5,"IPHONE WHO? GALAXY WHO?
      
      
      THIS IS THE MOTHER OF ALL SMART PHONES. EVERYONE WHO SEES IT IS ASTONISHED. THE SCREEN IS MARVELOUS. IT DOESN'T HAVE THE CONTRAST OF AN LED SCREEN BUT THAT MAKES IT ALL THE MORE BETTER AS MY SCREEN DOESN'T LOOK CARTOONISH. THE COLOURS LOOK MORE REAL THAN AN LED SCREEN. IT IS FAST AND NIPPY. DOES NOT LAG. THE VIDEOS PLAY AWESOME. THE CAMERA IS GOOD BUT DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS. I EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE."
Xperia Z,5,"IT IS AWESOME.. UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHY IS REAL COOL. PHONES GETS HEATED A BIT BUT NO ISSUES. THE CAMERA CLARITY IS FINE AND CAN BE USED TO CLICK SOME AMAZING PICS.
      
      THE DESIGN LOOKS DECENT, SLEEK AND GLOSSY FINISH."
Xperia Z,5,"ITS AN AWESOME PHONE WILL COOL FEATURES.
      
      PREVIOUSLY I WAS OWNING IPHONE 4S AND I MOVED TO XPERIA Z BEFORE 3 WEEKS. IT FEELS MORE BEAUTIFUL AND GIGANTIC IN HANDS AND IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF MOVING TO ANDROID IS THE CUSTOMIZATIONS AND AS I AM A PHOTOGRAPHER I NEED TO CARRY MY PICTURES AND NEED TO SHARE IT WHEN I NEED IT. SO I MOVED TO THIS. ITS REALLY GREAT MOBILE WITH SUPERB DISPLAY
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1) STUNNING BIG SCREEN.
      
      2) AWESOME SOUND QUALITIES IN HEADPHONES
      
      3) SUPERB SCREEN TO WATCH MOVIES AND PICTURES.
      
      4) PREMIUM FEEL WITH BEAUTIFUL DESIGN
      
      5) WATER AND DUST RESISTANT (MOST WANTED FEATURE FOR ME)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1) HEATING PROBLEM (IPHONE ALSO HAD HEATING PROBLEM OCCASIONALLY BUT THIS ONE HEATS MORE FAST)
      
      2) BATTERY DRAINS MORE FASTER
      
      3) CONSUMES MORE MOBILE DATA COMPARED TO IPHONE.(CONSUMED 1GB MOBILE DATA WITHIN 10DAYS EVEN WITH WIFI ENABLED WHEN I WAS IN HOME WHERE AS IPHONE CONSUMED ONLY 1.3GB FOR WHOLE MONTH EVEN WITHOUT THE HELP OF WIFI )
      
      
      CONCLUSION:
      
      FINALLY ITS A GREAT PHONE TO HAVE FUN AND USER FRIENDLY. WITH LOT OF FEATURES WHICH I AM YET TO EXPLORE."
Xperia Z,5,"IT'S CATEGORIZED WRONG ON FLIPKART. IT'S NOT A SMARTPHONE. IT'S A SUPERPHONE!
      
      
      STILL WAITING FOR MINE :) USED IT FOR HALF HOUR IN SONY CENTER :P
      
      IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PHONE AVAILABLE IN MARKET :)
      
      IT LOOKS DAMN SEXY
      
      
      THANK YOU SONY FOR SUCH AN AWESOME DEVICE :)"
Xperia Z,5,"I'VE BEEN USING SONY XPERIAZ SINCE LAST 2 WEEKS AND STILL IN AWE WITH THE DESIGN OF THIS PHONE.
      
      
      I UPGRADED FROM SAMSUNG GALAXY S WHICH I USED FOR 3 YEARS AND WAS ON A LOOKOUT FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I EVEN THOUGHT OF SGS4 BUT I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE BUILT AND PERFORMANCE OF MY PREVIOUS SAMSUNG PHONE.
      
      
      THIS PHONE IS SO BEAUTIFUL WITH A GLASS CASE THAT PEOPLE WILL COME TO YOU WHETHER AT OFFICE OR OUTSIDE. PERFORMANCE IS EXTREMELY FAST THANKS TO QUAD-CORE AND 2 GB RAM. ALL THE APPLICATIONS RUNS SMOOTHLY WITHOUT ANY LAG.
      
      
      USER INTERFACE AND COLOR CONTRAST OF THIS PHONE IS JUST PERFECT AND GIVES YOU NATURAL COLORS RATHER THAN OVER SATURATED COLORS OF AMOLED SCREEN WHICH I HAVE USED FOR 3 YEARS. BATTERY BACK UP IS GREAT WITH STAMINA MODE GIVING LIFE TO A DAY.
      
      
      GO FOR THIS BEAUTY AND YOU WILL LOVE IT...."
Xperia Z,5,"JUST BOUGHT THE XPERIA Z (PURPLE) A FEW DAYS AGO. SO HERE GOES MY REVIEW:
      
      # DESIGN #  - SMOOTH, MINIMALISTIC AND VERY PREMIUM. IT TRULY IS ONE BEAUTIFUL PHONE.
      
      
      #SIZE &AMP; WEIGHT #  - IT IS A 5-INCH PHABLET SO PLEASE DONT EXPECT TO OPERATE IT WITH SINGLE-HANDEDLY. BUT IT DOES HAVE A GOOD FEEL TO IT AND A FIRM GRIP DESPITE IT HUGE SIZE, AS IT IS NARROW ENOUGH TO HOLD IT COMFORTABLY. IT MAY WEIGH 146G, BUT SURE FEELS VERY LIGHT!
      
      
      # DISPLAY #  - THE BIGGEST POSITIVE ABOUT SONY IS ITS BRAVIA 2 DISPLAY. MOVIES AND VIDEOS LOOK VERY LIFELIKE, YOU CANT HELP BUT GASP AT THE AMAZING READ HD DISPLAY QUALITY.
      
      
      # SPEED #  - A QUAD-CORE THAT PROVED LAG-LESS WITH EVERY TOUCH. I KEPT SEVERAL APPLICATIONS ON AT A TIME, AND STILL IT WORKED SMOOTHLY WITHOUT ANY GLITCHES.
      
      
      # CAMERA # - WORKS EFFECIENTLY, THE EXMOR RS TECH IN IT HELPS A LOT AND YOU CAN CLICK SHARP PHOTOS WITHOUT ANY WAIT ON PROCESSING. ALTHOUGH THE CAMERA APP DOES TAKE TIME TO START IN THE FIRST PLACE, BUT AFTER THAT ITS SMOOTH SAILING.
      
      
      # MUSIC # - ALTHOUGH IT HAS ONLY A SINGLE, MONO SPEAKER TUCKED IN ON THE SIDE..THE WALKMAN WORKS WONDERFULLY. YES, THIS DOESN'T GIVE A VERY LOUD SOUND AT THE HIGHEST VOLUME SETTING BUT IT DOES GIVE A VERY SMOOTH SOUND WHICH IS CLEAR ON AND OFF THE HEADPHONE USE USING THE 'CLEARAUDIO+' FEATURE BUILT IN.
      
      
      # APPS # - NOT MUCH BUILT IT, (BUT WHAT IS GOOGLE PLAY AND THE INTERNET FOR?) - THERE ARE SOME INTERNET BASED APPS LIKE EVERNOTE AND WHICH ARE NOT OF MUCH USE TO ME. THE OFFICE SUITE, NOTES (WITH BUILT IN AUDIO RECORDER!),ADOBE READER,VOICE DIALER HELP WITH DAILY DUTIES. THE X4 PLAYER PLAYS ALL KINDSA MOVIES THAT YOU UPLOAD ONTO YOUR PHONE/SD MEMORY.SOCIAL APPS - FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE (WITH WIDGET), SOCIALIFE, GMAIL, MESSENGER,GOOGLEPLUS, EMAIL ETC ARE BUILT IN.
      
      
      # GAMING # - SMOOTH AND CLEAR. THERE IS THE HOOKED,PLAYUP,GOOGLE PLAYSTORE,PLAY NOW APPS THAT HELP U DOWNLOAD/PLAY YOUR FAVOURITE GAMES.
      
      
      # TRAVEL # - NAVIGATE, LOCAL, WISEPILOT GUIDE YOUR JOURNEY OUTDOORS.
      
      
      # POWER # - BEING A PHABLET, AFTER SOME MEDIUM USAGE (CAMERA, A COUPLE OF VIDEOS AND SOME SONGS AND GENERAL PHONE USE) THE PHONE LASTED ABOUT 15 HOURS. WITH THE STAMINA MODE ON(WHICH SHUTS ALL UNNECESSARY APPS), IT WILL LAST A BIT MORE THAN A DAY WHICH IS FINE.
      
      
      SO HERE'S THE VERDICT -
      
      #PROS: SUPERB DISPLAY, GOOD CAMERA, PREMIUM BUILD AND DESIGN, VERY GOOD GAMING, SUPER FAST PROCESSING, SMOOTH AND CLEAR SOUND, THE MOVIES ARE FANTASTIC WHEN PLAYED ON XPERIA Z.
      
      P.S: THE FREE GOODIES LIKE THE HEADSET(VERY HIP!!!), EXTRA SCREEN GAURDS AND PREMIUM CASE THAT COME WITH IT ADD THE CHERRY ON TOP. I CAN TAKE THIS PHONE OUTDOORS AND EVEN ON A TRIP WITHOUT STRESSING ABOUT WEATHERING IT DOWN (THANKS TO THE DUSTPROOF, WATERPROOF TECH)
      
      
      #CONS: IF THERE BE ANY CON - SHOULD HAVE COME WITH SOME DECENT GAMES BUILT IN (COME ON,SONY - YOU OWN PLAYSTATION!), A MOVIE OR TWO FOR FREE. EARPHONES ARE A BIT FLIMSY. THERE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DOUBLE-SIDED SPEAKERS. GOT A BIT HEATED UP AFTER ABOUT 20 MIN OF FIDDLING WITH THE CAMERA APP. YEAH, ITS A FINGERPRINT MAGNET BUT ITS COVERED IN PREMIUM GLASS, SO THATS A GIVEN - USE A SOFT CLOTH TO CLEAN THE SURFACE ONCE IN A WHILE.
      
      
      SAMSUNG S4 MIGHT HAVE ALL THE COOL APPS, BUT THE PLASTIC BUILD IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. BESIDES, IT WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE OF TAKING IT OUT DURING A HOLIDAY, WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT MESSING IT UP. AND YES, I HAVE KNOWN SAMSUNG MOBILES TO BE VERY SCRATCHY AT HIGH VOLUMES, NOT SMOOTH AND CLEAR. I VOTE FOR SONY XPERIA Z"
Xperia Z,5,"JUST.................FANTASTIC I LOVE ITS CAM CAPACITY OF HD RECORDING N STILL EXPOSURES, TOUCH SENSITIVITY. JUST MICRO SIM FINISHES POSSIBILITY OF CHANGING SIM FROM ONE TO ANOTHER MOBILE .FAST PROCESSOR MAKES THE EXPERIENCE ENJOYABLE"
Xperia Z,5,"LOVE EVERY BIT OF THIS BEAUTIFUL GADGET. I WAS VERY APPREHENSIVE AND HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT THIS PHONE BEFORE I PLACED THE ORDER, HOWEVER NOW I AM EXTREMELY GLAD I DID.
      
      
      IF YOU ARE CONTEMPLATING ON BUYING THIS PHONE, DO GO AHEAD. DO NOT PAY ANY HEED TO PPL COMPLAINING ABOUT HEATING, VIEWING ANGLES AND ALL THAT NON SENSE. THE PHONE DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES AND MORE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LOOKS A ZILLION TIMES BETTER THAN ANY SAMSUNG ETC OUT THERE (THE PICTURES DONT DO JUSTICE TO THIS PHONE'S LOOKS). WORTH EVERY BUCK YOU PAY ESPECIALLY ON FK WITH THE ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT."
Xperia Z,5,"OKAY FOR THE PHONE IS VERY GOOD NO DOUBTS PLUS THE DESIGN IS BEUATIFUL WITH GREAT BUILD QUALITY..
      
      THIS ISN'T A REVIEW BUT A REPLY TO GAURAV KRISHNA
      
      
      1)ITS A FULL HD PHONE SO DISPLAY IS AWESOME AND IT IS HAVING A BRAVIA ENGINE2 WHICH IS THE PLUS POINT..... VIEWING ANGLE IS NOT GREAT....S3 IS NOT A FULL HD PHONE......BUT IF U SEE S3 AND XPERIA Z SCREEN FROM FRONT THEN XPERIA Z IS THE SURE WINNER........99% TIMES U USE UR PHONE FROM FRONT SO VIEW ANGLES IS NOT A BIG ISSUE........
      
      MY OPINION : XPERIA Z IS MORE OF A COMPETITION TO S4 INSTEAD OF S3 AND S4 N Z HAS ALMOST IDENTICAL SCREEN PPI WISE N SIZE WISE TECH MAY BE DIFFERENT BUT BOTH R GOOD THEIR OWN KIND OF TECH SO U DON'T HAVE ANY POINT HERE..
      
      
      2)HEADPHONE QUALITY IS OF TOP QUALITY.....IN THIS WE KNOW SAMSUNG IS TOO FAR BEHIND HTC AND SONY.....
      
      MY OPINION: I OWN AN APPLE SAMSUNG HTC AND SONY AS WELL , HTC ISN'T GOOD UNLESS THE BEATS HEADPHONES ARE PROVIDED WITH THEM AND REST SAMMY HTC N SONY R SAME ...
      
      
      3)ITS HAVING 13MP CAMERA WHICH IS NOT GREAT BUT IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN S3 BECAUSE U WILL FEEL IT WHEN U ZOOM UR PICTURES.....XPERIA Z IS HAVING A BURST MODE WHICH CAN TAKE 998 PHOTOES IN 67SEC CONTINUOUSLY......THATS GREAT....
      
      MY OPINION: AGAIN U R COMPARING WITH S3 INSTEAD OF S4.. S4 HAS BEST CAMERA FEATURE LIKE DUAL CAM WHICH IS 1ST OF ITS KIND FEATURE .. S4 ALSO HAVE A 13MP SHARP CAMERA
      
      
      4)IT IS PLAYSTATION CERTIFIED..SO IF U R GAME LOVER ITS A GREAT NEWS.........
      
      MY OPINION: YES ITS PS CERTIFIED GOOD FOR GAMERS :)
      
      
      5)BATTERY IS 2330MAH WHICH IS LESS THAN S4(2600MAH) AND MORE THAN S3(2100MAH)...BUT XPERIA Z IS HAVING STAMINA MODE WHICH MAXIMIZE UR BATTERY 3-4 TIMES....IN THE END WHICH IS MUCH BETTER THAN S3 AND S4......
      
      MY OPINION: AGAIN S3 IS NOT A COMPETITION AND S4 CAN LAST AS MUCH LONGER THAN Z WHEN ITS POWER SAVING MODE IS ON ...
      
      
      6)LOOKS WHICH IS THE MAIN POINT OF THE PHONE......HERE NOTHING TO DISCUSS...CLEARE WINNER XPERIA Z....S3 AND S4 WHICH IS 99% SIMILAR IS NOTHING IN FRONT OF XPERIA Z .......
      
      MY OPINION: S3 N S4 DO LOOK ALIKE BUT STILL ARE ALOT DIFFERENT LIKE S4 HAS BETTER PROCESSOR , RAM , SCREEN SIZE , CAMERA AND HUGE NEW COLLECTION OF SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENT .
      
      
      7)SHATTERPROOF SCREEN...WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE ON S3 AND S4.........
      
      MY OPINION: OH YEAH ?? :P WOW S4 HAS GORILLA GLASS 3 WHICH IS VERY MUCH STRONG , M NOT COMPARING IT TO Z BUT JUST TELLING .. AND IF IT IS SHATTER PROOF N SONY IS SO SURE THEY SHOULD PROVIDE A CERTIFICATE AND OFFER FREE REPLACEMENT ON A CRACK SCREEN.. ASK SONY FOR U CERTIFICATE ASAP :)
      
      
      8)DRAGONTRAIL GLASS ON XPERIA Z WHICH IS 6 TIMES BETTER THAN GORILLA GLASS......SO 6 TIMES TOUGHER THAN S3 AND S4......
      
      MY OPINION: AGAIN ASK FOR UR CERTIFICATE O:)
      
      
      9)WATERPROOF AND DUSTPROOF WHICH IS SURPRISE FEATURE OF XPERIA Z.....THIS IS NOT PRESENT ON S3 AND S4.........SO U CAN TAKE VIDEO AND STILL PHOTOES IN RAIN AND IN POOL.........
      
      MY OPINION: AGREED 100% TRUE
      
      
      10)S3,S4,SAMSUNG GRAND,GALAXY S DUOS....ALL SAMSUNG PHONES LOOKS SAME ...SO U DON'T WANT 2 INVEST 40K ON S4 WHICH LOOKS SAME AS 20K SAMSUNG GRAND............
      
      MY OPINION: JUST KEEP S4 N GRAND TOGETHER AND M PRETTY MUCH SURE THEY WON'T SEEM ALIKE .. SAMSUNG PHONE DOES LOOK ALIKE BUT THEIR PREMIUM PHONE LIKE S SERIES N NOTES ARE JUST DIFFERENT FRM OTHER SAMMY WHEN U HOLD THEM N USE THEM ... NOW U OWN A Z SO M SURE U WON'T AGREE WITH ME
      
      
      FINAL WORDS : Z IS KINDA FULL PACKAGE BUT JUST THAT YOU NOW OWN A SONY DOESN'T MEAN OTHER PHONE SUCKS ... WHY U DIDN'T MENTION THAT S4'S PROCESSOR N SOFTWARE FEATURES R WAY BEYOND UR WATER PROOF PHONE ??
      
      Z IS A VERY GOOD PHONE AND I WOULD DEFINITELY ADVISE OTHERS TO BUY ... M JUST A TECH GEEK N FAN SO THATS WHY I REPLIED TO THIS MAN SO A PHONE (S4) WHICH IS ALSO VERY GOOD DOEN'T GET BAD IMAGE ON OTHERS :)
      
      PLS GAURAV DONT BE A FANBOY WHATS GOOD IS GOOD ..."
Xperia Z,5,"REALLY IT'S A GOOD PHONE AND BEST PHONE FROM SONY.
      
      EVERY PHONE HAS PROS AND CONS BUT IT'S HAS MORE PROS AND VERY FEW CONS WHICH CAN BE MANAGED WRT TO ALL OTHER PHONES IN MARKET.
      
      
      PRONS:
      
      1.NICE AND SMOOTH TOUCH. 2. BETTER CAMERA. 3.NICE DESIGN AND LOOK.
      
      4. BETTER AUDIO/VIDEO QUALITY. 5.BETTER BATTERY HEALTH(EXCEPT WHILE USING INTERNET/WI-FI).
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. EXTERNAL SPEAKER HAS LESS LOUDNESS WHICH CAN BE I THINK LITTLE BIT SHOULD MORE, BUT NO PROBLEM IF YOU ARE USING HEADSET/EARPIECE WHICH WE GENERALLY USE.
      
      2.OVER WI-FI/3G, BATTERY DRAINING VERY FAST EVEN YOU DO CONTINUOUS NORMAL BROWSE OR CHAT, HERE IT SHOULD BE MORE. WHAT I OBSERVED IF I WILL USE CONTINUOUS NORMAL BROWSE AND CHAT WITHOUT ANY DOWNLOAD , BATTERY WILL LAST FOR MAX 6HRS BUT IF U TAKE BREAK IN BROWSING/CHATTING WHICH WE DEFINITELY DO MANY TIMES SO BATTERY WILL LAST FOR 12-13HOURS.
      
      I AM TALKING ABOUT NEWLY PHONE.
      
      IN GENERAL, ALL DEPENDS ON USER HOW MUCH THEY ARE USING THE PHONE , THERE IS NOT HARD N FAST RULE FOR BATTERY BACKUP.
      
      FOR ME, THESE 2 CONS CAN BE MANAGED. I PUT IT IN CONS AS THERE IS DEFINITELY POSSIBILITY FOR IMPROVEMENT WHICH CAN BE DONE BUT NOT NECESSARY.
      
      
      3. SONY HAS TO RELEASE UPDATES LITTLE BE FAST AS COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES WHICH SONY IS LAGGING.
      
      
      BUT THIS PHONE IS BEST TO BUY IF I COMPARE WITH S4/LUMIA 920/IPHONE ALSO.
      
      S4/IPHONE NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED OVER IT. LUMIA 920 CAN BE RECOMMENDED BUT 920 HAS LESS APPS AND LITTLE BIT HEAVY."
Xperia Z,5,"SERIOUSLY GO FOR XPERIA Z.
      
      
      PROS :
      
      1. QUAD CORE 1.5 GHZ SNAPDRAGON PRO PROCESSOR. (WORK LOAD IS HANDLED EASILY.)
      
      2. 2GB RAM (WORKS MANY APPS IN BACKGROUND. NO LAG AND NO HANG.)
      
      3. SOUL SHAKING CLARITY . (DO I NEED TO EXPLAIN HERE ABOUT SONY QUALITY.)
      
      4. 13 MP CAMERA. HDR 1080P (FULL HD RECORDING. BEST PICTURE AND VIDEOS IN ANY LIGHT CONDITIONS.)
      
      5. DISPLAY CLARITY HIGHEST AVAILABLE TILL THIS DATE. (441 PPI.)
      
      6. WATER PROOF AND DUST PROOF.
      
      7. COVERED WITH DRAGONTAIL GLASS (TOUGH AS METAL) , ULTRA LIGHT WEIGHT AND FEELS PREMIUM WHEN U HOLD IT. (NOT LIKE OTHER PLASTIC PHONE WHICH ARE DULL.)
      
      8. PLAYSTATION CERTIFIED, BLUETOOTH 4.0, NFC , WIFI HOTSPOT , REMOTE CONTROL , 4G LTE (SPEED 100 MBPS).
      
      9. BATTERY LIFE IS AWESOME. (WORKS FULL DAY WITH ALL ACTIVITIES WORKING. STAMINA MODE INCLUDED.)
      
      10. HDMI SUPPORT , ONE TOUCH MIRRORING , WIRELESS CHARGING WITH CHARGING DOCK DK26.
      
      
      CONS :
      
      NOT APPLICABLE. :)"
Xperia Z,5,"SONY HAS REALLY COME OFF ON THE PHONE DESIGNS. I HAVE STARTED LOVING THE XPERIA HANDSET DESIGNS. I CAN SAY, THAT SONY HAS BEEN DOING A BETTER JOB THAN HTC WITH THEIR HANDSET DESIGNS. ALTHOUGH, I AM NOT A GREAT FAN OF SONY'S UI OVERLAY, BUT IT'S NOT THAT BAD. AT-LEAST IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN SAMSUNG'S.
      
      
      AS FOR FLIPKART, AS ALWAYS, THE PACKAGING AND THE DELIVERY WAS VERY GOOD."
Xperia Z,5,"SONY IS THE BEST IN MARKET DOMINATING ALL PRICE RANGES
      
      ONE OF MY FRIEND OWNZ XPERIA Z AND HERE'S WHAT I FELT AFTER USING IT MANY TIMES ( I OWN XPERIA L)
      
      *THE DEVICE LOOKS STUNNING, AND IS WATERPROOF AND DUST PROOF.. HE SHOWED MY THE PROOF JUST AS KATRINA KAIF DID IN THE ADVERTISEMENT.
      
      *DISPLAY IS NOT THAT EYE-POPPING AS SUPER AMOLED OR SUPER LCD.. BUT IT DOES THE JOB PRETTY WELL.. IT HAS A FULL HD DISPLAY SO MIND IT! AND COMPLAINING ABOUT VIEWING ANGLES? ARE YOU STUPID ENOUGH TO WATCH YOUR PHONE TILTED?
      
      *PERFORMANCE IS SWEET.. ABSOLUTELY NO LAGS IN ANY APPS WHATSOEVER
      
      *BATTERY IS ABOVE AVERAGE (PLAYED MC4 FOR 10 MINS AND JUST 4% DECREASE IN BATTERY)
      
      *CAMERA IS LOVELY.. LOW-LIGHT MAY BE A LITTLE PROBLEM.. BUT HDR DOES THE JOB WELL.. ONLY IF HDR IMAGES COULD BE TAKEN QUICKER
      
      
      FEW CONS ( NOBODY'S PERFECT)
      
      *EVERY DEVICE HETAS UP, DO DOES THIS
      
      *SINCE ITS A FLAGSHIP PHONE, THE SPEAKER SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A BETTER POSITION, AND A LITTLE LOUDER PERHAPS.. BUT CLARITY IS ABSOLUTELY SONY CLASS
      
      
      DON'T THINK TWICE ABOUT THE DEVICE- ONLY DEVICE WHICH YOU CAN COOL DOWN BY DIPPING IN WATER, AND KEEP IN DUSTY ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT WORRY!
      
      AND THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE NAME OF SONY BY BIASED AND FALSE REVIEWS
      
      REMEMBER: IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BRING US DOWN, YOU ARE ALREADY BENEATH US!! ;-)"
Xperia Z,5,"SONY XPERIA Z IS ONE OF THE BEST SMARTPHONE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET. EVERYTHING IS BLAZING FAST, THE ONLY ISSUE IS ITS BATTERY. I REALLY LIKE THE UI &AMP; THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD. DISPLAY WILL FADE OUT IF YOU VIEW THE SCREEN IN DIFFERENT ANGLES BUT I THINK ITS NOT BIG ISSUE. IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS PHONE FOR BUSINESS PURPOSE THEN DON'T BUY IT, BATTERY MAY EVAPORATE WITH IN 2 OR 3 HOURS."
Xperia Z,5,"SONY XPERIA Z IS THE BEST PHONE I EVER SAW. ONE OF MY NEPHEW IS USING. I SAW FROM HIM. ITS DISPLAY QUALITY, SOUND AND ALL THING IS OK.
      
      SO I BOUGHT IT TODAY. HOPE I WILL GET IT SOON. I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO GET IT."
Xperia Z,5,"THE BEST PHONE MONEY CAN BUY...
      
      
      PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO FOOLS WHO CLAIMS THE FOLLOWING:
      
      1. BAD VIEWING ANGLES- YOU WON'T BE USING YOUR PHONE SIDEWISE UNLESS YOU'RE SERIOUSLY PHYSICALLY DISABLED OR YOU'RE PAID BY SONY HATERS TO CLAIM SHITS. THE VIEWING ANGLE IS NOT A FACTOR TO DECEIVE A SMARTPHONE...
      
      2. SLOW PROCESSOR/OUTDATED CPU- XPERIA Z IN POWERED BY A QUAD CORE SNAPDRAGON S4 CPU, CLOCKED AT 1.5 GHZ... I BELIEVE MANY OF YOU DON'T EVEN OWN A QUAD CORE DESKTOP OR LAPTOP.. BUT STILL YOU'RE DECIDING TO BUY AN OCTA CORE OR HIGHER CLOCKED QUAD CORE SMARTPHONE... WHAT THE HELL YOU NEED IT FOR??? I THINK YOU LIKE THE EXTRA HEAT IT WOULD GENERATE... IT JUST KILLS YOUR BATTERY FASTER.. BELIEVE ME.. YOU WON'T REQUIRE ANYTHING MORE THAN THIS FOR ANY GOOGLE PLAY APPLICATION IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS"
Xperia Z,5,"THE PHONE XPERIA Z IS A JOY TO BEHOLD.. I REALLY LIKE THIS PHONE.. BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL U I
      
      KNOW ALOT ABOUT PHONES, I WASN'T SURE ABOUT THE SNAPDRAGON S4 PROCESSOR(WHEN 600 IS ALREADY OUT) BUT THIS PHONE SEEM TO RUN SMOOTHLY, YEAH YEAH ABOUT THE DISPLAY; MAY BE ITS BECAUSE ITS ON CAMERA OR SOMETHING BUT THE DISPLAY SHOULDN'T BOTHER ANYONE, ITS A VERY GOOD DISPLAY(NOT THE BEST DEFINITELY), BUT ITS REALLY GOOD. I NOTICED THAT THE AUTOMATIC SETTINGS FOR THE DISPLAY IS ON, IF U REMOVE THAT SETTING AND ADJUST THE DISPLAY THEN U'D C THE TRUE COLOUR OF THE DEVICE, BUR EVEN WIT THAT ON, THE DISPLAY IS STILL WONDERFUL. ITS NO SURPRISE WHY THIS PHONE IS ALREADY OUT OF STOCK ON FLIPKART(BUR I'M SURE IT'LL BE BACK IN STOCK).
      
      
      SERIOUSLY I LIKE THIS PHONE."
Xperia Z,5,"THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME AS FAR AS SPECIFICATIONS AND PERFORMANCE IS CONCERNED. I JUST WAITED TO FIRST USE IT AND THEN PUT UP ANY REVIEW. FOR THE FIRST TIME FLIPKART TOOK 3 DAYS IN DELIVERING THIS PRODUCT. GENERALLY THEY DELIVER IT WITHIN 48 HRS. I HAD BOOKED THIS IN PREORDER BOOKING BEFORE THE MOBILE WAS LAUNCHED IN INDIAN MARKET. SO GOT A GOOD DISCOUNT. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS AWESOME. PERFORMANCE WISE ULTIMATE.I THINK KATRINA IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THE ADVERTISEMENTS AS THE PHONE SEEMS MORE BEAUTIFUL. THE ONLY REGRET IS THE MOBILE COVER , PROVIDED WITH THE SET, AND PLASTIC SIM TRAY. I THINK THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
      
      
      PERSONALLY FEEL THE PRICE IS ON LOWER SIDE FOR A MOBILE LIKE THIZ."

Xperia Z,5,"THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST ANDROID PHONE EVER I'VE EVER USED. THERE IS CERTAINLY NO LAG WHATSOEVER IN ANYWAY. MULTITASKING IS A BREEZE, PLAYING HD VIDEOS SEAMLESSLY AND WHAT AN AMAZING CAMERA, ALL THIS PACKED WITH THE LATEST ANDROID IN A 1080P SCREEN, SOLID WATER-RESISTANT, SCRATCH-PROOF BODY! TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY AND HAS AN ELEGANT LOOK IN YOUR HAND IN IT'S LIGHT WEIGHT CHASSIS.

      FREE HEADPHONE IS GOOD BUT POUCH IS JUST OK.
      
      USER INTERFACE IS ALSO GREAT AND FUN TO USE....OVERALL ITS A GREATEST ANDROID PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE,U CAN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS IN QUALITY AND DURABILITY..."
Xperia Z,5,"THIS IS A SPECTACULAR PHONE FROM SONY. THE BRAVIA ENGINE 2 MAKES THE DISPLAY LOOK NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING. EXCELLENT CAMERA PICTURE QUALITY, BATTERY LIFE IS OKAY BUT IMPROVED WITH STAMINA MODE. ABOVE ALL, IT LOOKS JUST GREAT, EASILY THE CLASSIEST SONY MOBILE YET AND AN EQUAL WITH THE BEST ANDROID PHONES OUT THERE. MY GF LOVES IT A LOT TOO. THE LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND RELIABLE FROM FLIPKART."
Xperia Z,5,"THIS IS NOT A REVIEW BUT THIS IS A REPLY TO SUHAIL SACHDEVA .
      
      AFTER READING UR REPLY 2 GAURAV KRISHNA AND GAURAV KRISHNA REVIEW.IN MY MIND IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU ARE SAMSUNG FANBOY AND HE IS SONY FANBOY.SO WHO 2 TRUST.
      
      1-DISPLAY- BOTH R GOOD DISPLAY.BOTH R 441PPI AND FULL HD PHONE AND 5INCH DISPLAY.I AGREE WITH U IN THIS.
      
      2-HEADPHONE-U R SAYING U USE ALL PHONES LIKE APPLE,SAMSUNG,SONY AND HTC.AND YOU R SAYING SAMSUNG AND SONY SOUND QUALITY IS SAME.WHY DON'T U MENTION THE PHONES NAME,LIKE WHICH SONY AND WHICH SAMSUNG PHONES U USED.DON'T WRITE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE,BECAUSE EVERY PERSON IN THIS WORLD KNOW WHO HAVE LISTEN BOTH COMPANY SOUND THAT SONY IS AHEAD FROM SAMSUNG AND APPLE.I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HTC SOUND QUALITY.
      
      3-CAMERA-BOTH R HAVING 13MP. U R SAYING S4 IS HAVING DUAL CAM MODE. YAA THIS IS GREAT .BUT FROM XPERIA Z U CAN TAKE PICTURES IN RAIN AND VIDEOES IN WATER. WITHOUT ANY HESITATION U CAN CLICK PHOTOES IN FESTIVAL LIKE HOLI.WHICH U CAN'T DO WITH S4.S4 IS HAVING MANY OTHERS CAMERA FEATURES WHICH IS JUST A FEATURE WHICH U R NOT GOING 2 USE REGULARLY BUT XPERIA Z IS HAVING LIFE COMPANION FEATURES.SO WHO IS MORE CLOSER TO UR LIFE?
      
      4-BATTREY-U BOTH R SAYING BATTERY LIFE IS SAME.HAVE U TESTED S4 BATTERY LIFE?BUT SEEING S4 REVIEW I CAN SAY THAT IT CAN LAST A FULL DAY.BUT BATTERY LIFE DEPENDS ON OUR USAGE.
      
      5-LOOKS-SUHAIL SACHDEVA AFTER READING UR ANSWER I CAN CLEARY SAY THAT U R SAMSUNG FANBOY AND U R USING SAMSUNG PHONE. HOW CAN U SAY THAT S4 AND S3 IS NOT ALIKE.GO AND SEE ON YOU TUBE AND LISTEN WHAT REVIEWER IS SAYING. IN LOOKS U R MENTIONING PROCESSOR SPEED ,CAMERA,RAM AND FEATURES.WHAT IS THE RELATION OF  LOOKS WITH PROCESSOR SPEED,RAM AND CAMERA.EVERY PERSON KNOW THAT XPERIA Z IS FAR AHEAD IN LOOKS.
      
      6-SHATTERPROOF SCREEN- S4 IS HAVING GORILLA GLASS 3 AND  U R VERY SURE ABOUT GORILLA GLASS3.IS SAMSUNG PROVIDING ANY CERTIFICATE FOR THIS OR THEY R OFFERING FREE REPLACEMENT?NO COMPANY IN THIS WORLD PROMISE ABOUT THESE THINGS. WHY U NEED ONLY CERTIFICATE FROM SONY NOT FROM SAMSUNG OR HTC OR APPLE.
      
      7-DRAGONTRAIL GLASS VS GORILLA GLASS3-BOTH R GOOD .BUT ACCORDING 2 DROP TEST XPERIA Z IS TOUGHER BUT ACCORDING TO HAMMER TEST STORY IS DIFFERNT. S4 DROP TEST AND HAMMER TEST STILL NOT OUT YET.
      
      8-IF WE PUT SAMSUNG S4 AND GRAND TOGETHER WE CAN SAY THAT S4 FEELS MORE PREMIUM BUT STILL THEY BOTH LOOKS SAME.HAVE U TESTED S4 IN UR HAND?EVERY ONE WHO BOUGHT XPERIA Z OR NOT SAYS THE SAME.IF WE PUT S4 AND GRAND TOGETHER I M SURE IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO DIFFERENTIATE WHICH ONE IS S4 AND WHICH ONE IS GRAND.GAURAV KRISHNA IS SAYING ABOUT LOOKS NOT ABOUT FEELS.IN FEELING WISE ALSO XPERIA Z IS BETTER THAN S4.
      
      IN MY OPINION S4 IS GREAT DEVICE WHICH IS HAVING MANY COOL FEATURES WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE ON OTHERS PHONES.BUT IN 38K XPERIA Z IS BEST PHONE OF THE YEAR.S4 PRICE WILL BE AROUND 45K    ACCORDING TO SHOPPING SITES.WHICH IS 7K MORE THAN XPERIA Z.NOW IT IS UP TO BUYERS WHAT THEY WANT .THEY WANT A FULL PACKAGE PHONE OR A USELESS FEATURE PHONE WHICH IS 7K MORE THAN FULL PACKAGE PHONE.ACCORDING TO ME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN XPERIA Z AND S4 IS THAT WHAT U DO WITH S4 WITHOUT TOUCHING SCREEN U CAN DO THIS ON XPERIA Z BY TOUCHING SCREEN."
Xperia Z,5,"THIS IS NOT JUST THE BEST OF SONY IN A SMARTPHONE BUT THE BEST SMARTPHONE THERE IS. PERIOD!
      
      DID NOT BUY IT ON FLIPKART BUT WANTED TO JUST SHARE MY EXPERIENCE ABOUT THE PHONE.
      
      HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS AND...CAN'T SEEM TO FIND ANY FAULT WITH IT.
      
      ITS GOT THE POWER,ITS GOT THE PERFORMANCE AS WELL AND THEN,THE ICING ON THE CAKE...THE LOOKS!
      
      IT JUST LOOKS DROP DEAD GORGEOUS,ESPECIALLY IN ITS ALL BLACK AVATAR.
      
      I HAVE THE CASE AS WELL (WHICH IS REALLY REALLY GOOD,AND
      
      SO ARE THE HEADPHONES) BUT WITH LOOKS LIKE THESE...MAN...WHO WANTS TO PUT IT IN A COVER!
      
      LOVELY VIBRANT FULL HD 5 INCH SCREEN,TONS OF PROCESSING POWER AND NOT  EVEN THE SLIGHTEST LAG WHILE MULTI-TASKING. ON TOP OF THAT THERE IS THE EXTREMELY SOLID BUILD AND ITS DUST &AMP; WATER PROOF! WHAT MORE CAN YOU  REALLY WANT FROM A HIGH-END SMARTPHONE.
      
      ITS GOT IT ALL,AND THEN SOME MORE.
      
      MOVE OVER SAMSUNG, YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. THE JAPANESE GIANT IS BACK WITH A BANG!"
Xperia Z,5,"THIS IS REALLY A TRUE MASTERPIECE FROM SONY. THE VIEWING ANGLE PROBLEM IS JUST PURE GIBBERISH. I AM USING IT FOR LAST FEW DAYS AND IT WORKS LIKE DREAM. THE FEEL OF THIS PHONE IS TRULY ROYAL. YOU WILL DEFINITELY FEEL ITS WORTH THE MONEY.  ONLY TROUBLE IS THE BATTERY.
      
      WHICH LAST ONLY 5-6 HOURS MAX WITH ABOVE AVERAGE USE. THE 5 INCH GIANT DISPLAY( INCOMPARABLE QUALITY) DRAINS BATTERY LIKE AN F1 CAR CONSUMES PETROL. I FEEL SONY SHOULD HAVE USED AT LEAST 2800 MHZ BATTERY FOR THIS PHONE. THE MOBILE BRAVIA ENGINE 2 IS TOO DAMN POWER HUNGRY AND THE BATTERY CERTAINLY NOT CAPABLE TO HANDLE IT. ITS LIKE THE BATTERY LEVEL DROPS EVERY TIME YOU SWITCH ON THE DISPLAY FOR ANY USE.
      
      IT DEFINITELY DESERVES 5 IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OTHER THAN THE BATTERY LIFE. KUDOS TO SONY FOR MAKING SUCH AN AWESOME DEVICE."
Xperia Z,5,"THIS IS TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A ""SMARTPHONE"".
      
      SONY XPERIA Z IS THE SMARTPHONE U NEED TO BUY. GREAT PHONE.
      
      EVERYBODY MIGHT BE WELL AWARE OF THE SPECIFICATIONS BUT HERE IS SOMETHING FROM THE EXPERIENCE.
      
      
      - I HAVE BEEN USING XPERIA Z FROM PAST FEW WEEKS. THE FIRST THING WHICH AMAZES YOU THE CRYSTAL CLEAR DISPLAY. THE 1080P RESOLUTION SCREEN HAS TRULY MADE IT LOOK IT AMAZING. SONY'S BRAVIA ENGINE DISPLAY SIMPLY ENHANCES THE PICTURE QUALITY AND PLEASES YOUR EYES.
      
      
      - THE NEXT BEST THING ABOUT Z IS THE TOUCH SENSITIVITY. I HAVE USED SAMSUNG SIII AND HTC ONE X BUT THE TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO Z.
      
      
      - CAMERA. SONY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AHEAD IN THE CAMERA FEATURES. 13 MP CAMERA IS SERIOUSLY AWESOME. CAPTURING SPEED HAS REALLY IMPROVED AS COMPARED TO ITS PREVIOUS FLAGSHIP XPERIA S. GREAT PICTURE QUALITY. ALSO THE LOW-LIGHT IMAGING IS PERFECT. YES, YOU MAY FIND SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS ACROSS INTERNET FOR CAMERA OF Z WHEN COMPARED TO HTC ONE, BUT IT GIVE SUCH MINUTE DETAILS OF THE SPECIFICATION THAT A NORMAL PERSON(WHO IS NOT A PHOTOGRAPHER) WOULD NOT EVEN BOTHER TO READ IT AND STRAIGHT AWAY REACH TO THE CONCLUSION. I HAVE PERSONALLY COMPARED THE CAMERA OF Z WITH SIII AND ONE X. IT HAS AN UPPER HAND...
      
      
      - BATTERY BACKUP. THE AVERAGE BATTERY BACK UP IS AROUND 14-16 HOURS WITH CONTINUOUS 3G USAGE. BROWSING, SOCIAL NETWORKING AND GAMING IS ALSO TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. BUT WITH CONTINUOUS GAMING IT MIGHT DISCHARGE IN 5-6 HOURS, WHICH IS NORMAL FOR ANY SMARTPHONE OF THIS CALIBER. ALSO, IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE HIGH SPECS AND AMAZING DISPLAY, BATTERY POWER MIGHT BE REQUIRED RIGHT ?
      
      
      -OVERHEATING. I FOUND MANY REVIEWS COMPLAINING ABOUT OVERHEATING. COME ON GUYS ALMOST EACH AND EVERY SMARTPHONE GETS HEATED AFTER CONTINUOUS USAGE. I PERSONALLY DID NOT FIND IT OVERHEAT EXCEPT WHILE PLAYING NFS ON IT. OFFCOURSE YOU CAN DIP IT IN WATER AND IT WILL COOL OFF. :) AGAIN YOU CAN RESUME WITH GAMING,ETC.
      
      
      -CLEAR SOUND. THE INCOMING CALL VOICE IS SUPERBLY CLEAR. THE NOISE REDUCTION WORKS VERY EFFICIENTLY. REGARDING THE MUSIC, YOU CANNOT ARGUE WITH SONY'S ""WALKMAN"". ITS JUST AWESOME.
      
      
      - SOME DRAWBACKS. THE AWKWARD POSITION OF SPEAKERS. SONY COULD HAVE FOUND A BETTER PLACE FOR SPEAKERS AS ONE MAY COVER IT WHILE WATCHING VIDEOS OR PLAYING GAMES.
      
      MANY PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE COVERS FOR THE HEADPHONES SLOT. COME ON. THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN ORDER TO PROTECT IT TO MAKE IT WATER-RESISTANT RIGHT ?
      
      APART FROM THIS, I PERSONALLY DID NOT FIND ANY OTHER FLAWS.
      
      
      ITS TOTALLY WORTH THE PENNY.
      
      
      YOU WON'T REGRET AFTER PURCHASING IT..!! THUMBS UP...!!"
Xperia Z,5,"TRUELY SAID . . . BEST OF SONY IN A SMARTPHONE.
      
      PLAY FULL HD GAMES LIKE SHADOWGUN, N. O. V. A. 2, MODERN WELFARE 3, DEAD SPACE, GRAND THEFT AUTO III, AIRATTACK HD LITE, 9MM HD, BACKSTAB AND PES 2012 PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER AND XPERIENCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS XZEE AND OTHER BEASTS IN THE MARKET.
      
      YOU WILL FIND THIS CONSIDERABLY WAY POWERFUL.
      
      FOR GAMIFICATION I'D RECOMMEND THIS PHONE WITH 4 AND HALF RATING."
Xperia Z,5,WELL FIRST OF ALL IF YOU ARE CONFUSED BETWEEN SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 OR SONY XPERIA Z YOU SHOULD DEFINATELY BUY THIS ONE.THIS PHONE HAS AN AWESOME DESIGN WITH GLASS ON BACK AS COMPARED TO THE SHITTY PLASTIC BODY OF THE S4.TRUST ME GUYS THIS PHONE BEATS THE S4 IN ALL WAYS EXCEPT FOR ONE THING AND THAT IS THAT S4 HAS A FASTER PROCESSOR.BUT LEAVING THAT THIS PHONE ROCKS WITH AN AMAZING 1080 P DISPLAY AND IT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE S4
Xperia Z,5,"WHAT A MASTER PIECE FROM SONY.
      
      FROM LAST 2 WEEKS I M CONFUSED BETWEEN S4 AND XPERIA Z BECAUSE BOTH R AWESOME PHONES BUT AFTER READING MANY REVIEWS ON FLIPKART,I MAKE UP MY MIND ON XPERIA Z,SO TODAY I WENT TO SONY CENTER TO CHECK FOR THE PRICE BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE R SAYING THAT THEY BOUGHT IT IN 36K ONLY..BUT IN RANCHI PRICE IS STILL 38K AND ALSO THEY R SAYING THAT FROM 1ST OF APRIL THEY WILL INCREASE PRICE BY 4% FOR ALL XPERIA PHONES BECAUSE OF THE 2013 BUDGET.SO I BOOKED BLACK XPERIA Z BECAUSE BLACK COLOR IS NOT AVAILABLE IN ANY RANCHI SONY AND XPERIA CENTER, BUT THEY PROMISED ME THAT ANYHOW THEY WILL MANAGE IT BEFORE 3RD APRIL OTHERWISE THEY WILL GIVE ME SONY HEADPHONE FREE.
      
      NOW ABOUT FIRST IMPRESSION OF XPERIA Z,AFTER USING IT FOR 10-15 MIN I CAN SAY THAT THIS IS THE MOST HANDSOME OR BEAUTIFUL PHONE I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE.I M IMPRESSED HOW IT FITS COMFORTABLY IN MY HANDS AND IN MY JEANS POCKET.WHILE HOLDING IT FEELS LIKE YOU R HOLDING A RECTANGULAR PIECE OF GLASS.IT CAN BE USED AS A MIRROR ALSO.SO I M WAITING FOR MY BLACK Z."
Xperia Z,5,"WORTH EVERY PENNY, WAS WORRIED WITH ALL THE COMMENTS ONLINE ABOUT DISPLAY AND SOUND, ITS JUST OVERWHELMING, THE HEADSET IS GOOD ENOUGH. USE THE PLASTIC STICK PROVIDED IN THE SCRATCH GUARD PACK TO REMOVE THE N LOGO ON THE BACK SIDE BEFORE PASTING THE SCRATCH GUARD."
Xperia Z,5,"XPERIA Z EMERGED AS A CLEAR WINNER FOR ME (ALTHOUGH HAD TO WAIT FOR BLACK TO BECOME AVAILABLE) BETWEEN THE CHOICES OF HTC BUTTERFLY &AMP; HTC ONE. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO LEAVE HTC AFTER USING THEIR SMARTPHONES SINCE 2009 &AMP; GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THEIR UI. BUT USING THE XPERIA Z CHANGED THE PERCEPTION.
      
      
      UI IS GOOD &AMP; THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LAG WHATSOEVER. THE BEST FEATURE SONY HAS IMPLEMENTED IS THE BATTERY SAVING. NOW, I DON?T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT RE-CHARGING THE DEVICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WITH MY USAGE. THE STAMINA MODE &AMP; LOCATION BASED WIFI ALWAYS COMING TO THE RESCUE.
      
      
      SUPERIOR AUTO MODE OF THE CAMERA JUDGES THE CORRECT SCENE EVERY TIME. IT?S A BOON &AMP; PRODUCES GREAT RESULTS EVERYTIME. FULL HD DISPLAY IS BRILLIANT FURTHER COMPLEMENTED BY THE MOBILE BE2 ENHANCEMENT.
      
      
      VOICE CLARITY IS GOOD &AMP; THE SLOW TALK FEATURE IS GOOD ? EVEN SLOWS DOWN THE CALLER TUNES. A BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SPEAKER OUTPUT THOUGH BUT THEN AGAIN WATER &AMP; DUST PROOFING MAKE ME OVERLOOK THE SAME.
      
      
      FREEBIES (COVER &AMP; HEADSET) ARE A BIT DISAPPOINTING.
      
      
      ALL IN ALL, IT?S GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY SMARTPHONE."
Xperia Z,5,"Z MEANS THE LAST POSSIBLE ALPHABET SO DOES THIS PHONE MEANS....HAVING SPECIFICATIONS THAT MAKES IT A REAL BEAT AMONG THE ARENA... SOME OF THE SPECIFICATIONS ARE
      
      5 INCH HD DISPLAY
      
      13 MP CAM
      
      2 GB RAM
      
      A MUST BUY"
Xperia Z,4,""" AMLOD SCREEN AND TFT SCREEN DOESNT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE"".(SIC)
      
      ARE YOU SERIOUS? I HAVE A GALAXY NOTE WHICH HAS A RES OF 1280X800 AND IT'S VISIBLY BETTER THAN NOTE 2. MY WIFE' BROTHER HAS EXPERIA Z. I CAN'T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW MUCH MORE VIVID AND BRIGHT THE NOTE N7000'S DISPLAY IS COMPARED TO EXPERIA Z. THE WORTHY UPGRADE TO NOTE N7000 WILL BE NOTE 3, SO I'M WAITING...
      
      ALSO, ABOUT THE WATERPROOF THINGY. I ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED MY OLD DESIRE HD (A WONDERFUL PHONE BY THE WAY) IN A BIG BUCKET WITH WATER UPTO THE TOP. THE KICKER IS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD DROPPED IT! AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES, I REALISED IT WAS MISSING. I TRACED MY STEPS BACK AND FOUND THE PHONE LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BUCKET THAT WAS FULL OF WATER. NATURALLY I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT OUT, DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY, AND THEN LEFT IT TO DRY FOR AN HOUR IN THE SUN. THEN I RESTARTED IT AND IT WORKED PERFECTLY (A LINE OF MOISTURE WAS VISIBLE ACROSS THE DISPLAY WHICH DISAPPEARED AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OF USE)! AFTER IT WAS UNDER WATER FOR MORE THAN 5 MINUTES! WITHOUT ANY RUBBER COVERS FOR ANY PORTS! SO FORGIVE ME IF I'M NOT EXACTLY AWESTRUCK BY THE 'WATERPROOF' FEATURE OF EXPERIA Z."
Xperia Z,4,"1.S4 HAS SUPER AMOLED HD DISPLAY. WHICH IS BETTER THAN SONY TFT DISPLAY AND HTC ONE LCD DISPLAY
      
      2. S4 HS CORNING GORILLA CLASS 3 . SURELY IT S BETTER THAN BRAVIA ENGINE
      
      3.S4 ALSO HAS 13MP CAMERA WITH HDR . SONY ALSO HAS SAME THING....THE NEW IDEA IS S4 HAS DUAL SHOT, DUAL RECORDING AND MORE AND MORE SPECIAL FEATURES LIKE SMART ERASER , SOUND AND SHOT, STORY ALBUM ETC.
      
      4. S4 HAS 1.9 GHZ SNAPDRAGAN PROCESSOR WHICH MORE FASTER THAN SONY XPERIA Z AND HTC ONE
      
      5.S4 HAS 16/32/64 GB INTERNAL MEMORY AS WELL AS UPTO 64 GB EXTRENAL MEMORY.
      
      6.S4 HAS GESTURE SENSOR...WHICH IS MOST ADVANCED TECHNIQ..SO IT HAS AIR VIEW . SMART SCROLL AND LOTS OF COOL FEATURES
      
      7. S4 ALSO HAS SOME FEATUERS LIKE SMART PAUSE/RESUME, S TRANSLATER , IMPROVED S VOICE , PRE INSTALLED NAVIGATION ETC
      
      8.S4 HAS 2600MAH BATTERY WHICH IS LARGER THAN SONY 2330 MAH BATTERY
      
      IF U WANT TO SPENT MORE MONEY TO BUY A SMART PHONE, PLEASE CHOOSE S4 INSTEAD OF SONY XPERIA Z , SONY XPERIA HAS WATER AND DUST PROOF., OTHER THAN ALL THE FEATURES REMAINS SAME
      
      SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 IS A MOST SELLING SMART PHONE OF THE LAST YEAR. THIS YEAR ALSO THEY BECOME MORE SMART WITH COOL NEW FEATURES. IF U DO NOT LIKE NEW FEATURES MEANS GO FOR LOW RANGE PHONES...BECAUSE SONY XPERIA Z JUST INCREASE A PIXEL SIZE , SCREEN SIZE, MEMORY SIZE , BATTERY SIZE. THERE IS NO NEW INNOVATION....
      
      SAMSUNG WILL BE RELEASED IN LATEST ANDROID 4.2.2 AND SONY XPERIA Z RELEASED WITH ANDROID 4.1"
Xperia Z,4,"AMAZING, JUS NEED TO EXPLORE MORE. IT TOOK 2 YRS TO COMPLETELY EXPLOIT THE EXPERIA -X8 MY PREVIOUS ONE AND WHERE I PICKED IT FOR 13K AND NOW THIS ONE IS NEARLY 3 TIMES AND MAY BE TAKING THE SAME TIME OR MORE TO KNOW IT OR EXPLOIT IT FULLY. THE USP THAT ENTICED ME WAS THE DUST/LIQUID FREE FEATURE, ADVANCED CAPABILITIES AND OF COURSE A 'SONY'. THIS IS MY FOURTH SONY MOBILE I'VE BEEN USING SINCE 2003. STARTED WITH A T5, W580, EXP X-8 AND NOW THE 'Z'.
      
      
      THERE WAS NO MANUAL WITH THE PACK TO AMPLIFY THE FEATURES EMBEDDED IN THIS BEAUTY.
      
      
      THE NEXT BEST FEATURE IS IT BEING AN ANDROID."
Xperia Z,4,"BEFORE WRITING A REVIEW, I WILL RECOMMEND EACH AND EVERY PROSPECTIVE BUYER TO SCRUTINIZE, WHAT THEY ASPIRE FOR. WE TEND TO BUY A PRODUCT WHICH IN OPINION OF OTHER SEEMS AS GOOD/BETTER PRODUCTS, RATHER DECIDING WHAT WE NEED.
      
      
      WHAT I WANTED AND I GOT FROM THIS PRODUCT (VALUE FOR MONEY FEATURES/PROS)
      
      
      1)	GREAT CALMING MUSIC EXPERIENCE
      
      2)	BRAVIA ENGINE SCREEN
      
      3)	DESIGN: THE HANDSET FITS WELL IN HAND, IN-SPITE OF LARGE 5? SCREEN
      
      4)	NO LAG WHATSOEVER IN USER INTERFACE
      
      5)	STAMINA MODE WORKS WELL
      
      6)	WATER AND DUST RESISTANT
      
      
      WHAT ARE BELOW EXPECTATION FEATURES/CONS:
      
      1)	CAMERA QUALITY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
      
      2)	BATTERY DRAIN AND OVER-HEATING WHILE USING 3G OR LONG HOURS OF SCREEN USE (USUAL WITH ANDROID)
      
      3)	FINGER-PRINT MAGNET (GLASS BUILT)
      
      
      AT 38K I WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR A GREAT OVERALL EXPERIENCE. JUDGE FOR YOURSELF. 3.8 STARS"
Xperia Z,4,"HEY PEEPS. I BOUGHT THE XPERIA Z (PURPLE) FROM THE VIJAY SALES SHOP AT VASHI AS IT WASN'T AVAILABLE ON FLIPKART.
      
      I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW, AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M TRULY IMPRESSED BY SONY. MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE BEEN COMPARING THIS PHONE WITH S4, WHICH IS UTTER STUPIDITY AS LATTER WILL ONLY BE RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER AND ITS PRICE IS RUMOURED TO BE NEARLY RS.50000. YES, 50000! THE ONLY COMPETITOR FOR XPERIA Z AT PRESENT IS HTC ONE. THEREFORE, I'D LIKE TO MENTION OUT THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS PHONE---
      
      
      PROS:
      
      1. GREAT UI.
      
      2. AWESOME DISPLAY (THANKS TO BRAVIA ENGINE 2).
      
      3. HEADPHONES ARE THE BEST!
      
      4. DESIGN.
      
      5. STAMINA MODE WORKS VERY WELL.
      
      6. LIGHTNING-FAST PROCESSOR.
      
      7. WATER AND DUST RESISTANT.
      
      8. HDR MODE FOR CAMERA.
      
      9. GIVES YOU A 'RICH FEELING' WHILE IN YOUR HANDS AS ITS MADE OF GLASS, AND NOT CRAPPY PLASTIC.
      
      10. UPGRADE TO ANDROID 4.2.2. IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS.
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. SUB-PAR CAMERA PERFORMANCE.
      
      2. THE SPEAKER QUALITY IS DISAPPOINTING.
      
      3. PLAYSTATION MOBILE REMAINS WOEFULLY UNDERDEVELOPED.
      
      4. FINGERPRINT MAGNET.
      
      5. MEDIOCRE ERGONOMICS.
      
      
      FOR RS.37000, THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST BUY IN INDIA. BUT I'D ADVICE COST-CONSCIOUS PEOPLE TO WAIT FOR THE RELEASE OF HTC ONE, AS IT WILL BE CHEAPER AND HAVE ALMOST SAME FEATURES OF XPERIA Z.
      
      AND BUYERS, PLEASE DON'T EVER CONSIDER A SAMSUNG PHONE PRICED ABOVE RS.30000. THEY PUT USELESS FEATURES INTO YOUR MOBILE, WHICH YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW OF AND FOOL YOU INTO BUYING THEM."
Xperia Z,4,"I AM A SAMSUNG FANBOY SINCE PAST 3 YEARS.  BUT I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BEAUTY !! THINKING TO SWITCH OVER !
      
      PROS:
      
      1) DESIGN (SIMPLY SEXY.......SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW COMPARED TO SAMMYS SAME PLASTIC DESIGN )
      
      2) RELIABILTY OF SONY
      
      3) DURABILITY(WATERPROOF AND DUST PROOF)
      
      4) SOUND.
      
      5) SIZE AND WEIGHT.
      
      6) GREAT UI.
      
      7) SONY BRAVIA ENGINE 2 FOR VIEWING CRISP IMAGES.....
      
      NOTE : SCREEN DISPLAY IS GOOD AND GIVES TRUE COLORS UNLIKE SAMMY !!
      
      
      BUT SOME ISSUES IN MY MIND BEFORE BUYING IT......
      
      CONS:
      
      1)  SOME USERS COMPLAINING ABOUT WIFI ISSUES.....I AM NOT SURE BUT OUT OF 100 REVIEWS I  READ  20 PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT WIFI CONNECTIVITY ISSUES....(I AM TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON WIFI, SO PLEASE DO ADD SOME REVIEWS REGARDING ITS WIFI CONNECTIVITY)
      
      2)  HEATING ISSUE.....
      
      3)  THOUGH BATTERY IS 2330MAH IT IS A LITTLE WEAK.......(SONY IS NOT WELL KNOWN FOR BATTERY LIFE) ....PLS NOTE&GT;&GT; QUAD CORE PROCESSORS, FULL HD DISPLAYS, GAMING  TEND TO USE MORE BATTERY....
      
      4)  CAMERA QUALITY NOT UPTO THE MARK.
      
      5)  HDMI PORT IS NOT GIVEN.
      
      6)  SOME ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT BAD VIEWING ANGLES.....YES THERE ARE BAD VIEWING ANGLES COMPARED TO SGS3 AND HTC BUTTERFLY.....BUT NOTHING MAJOR IN IT....ITS SIMPLE &GT;I HOLD THE PHONE, I SEE THE PHONE !!
      
      
      FINAL VERDICT:
      
      APART FROM FEW CONS(WHICH EVERY PHONE HAVE) THIS PHONE IS WORTH A BUY.

      Z - ZIPPY !
      
      GO XPERIA !!"
Xperia Z,4,"I HAVE BEEN READING COMMENTS FROM SEVERAL USERS WHO WENT ATTACKING FOR OTHER BRANDS WITHOUT HAVING FULL KNOWLEGE. FIST OF ALL THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SONY HAS A SUPERIOR AUDIO AND CAMERA QUALITY BECAUSE OF ITS BRAVIA ENGINE. N THIS PHONE IS BEST EVER PHONE LAUNCHED BY SONY. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT SOME FACTS OVER A COMPARISION BETWEEN THIS PHONE AND SAMSUNG GALAXY S4. FIRSTLY, A COMMON USER NEEDS GOOD BATTERY BACKUP TO ENJOY A SMARTPHONE TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL. GUYZ OUR GALAXY NOTE 2 ALSO HAS 3100 MAH BATTERY AGAINST 2350 MAH OF THIS PHONE. S4 HAS A SUPER AMOLED HD SCREEN WHICH IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD. PLEASE ALSO KNOW THIS THAT SAMSUNG IS THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER FOR DISPLAY SCREENS OF APPLE PHONES ALSO. AS PER LAB REPORTS THE COLOURS IN THIS PHONE R NOT VIBRANT ENOUG AND THUS MAKES THE DISPLAY DIFFICULT TO READ IN SUNLIGHT. BEST OF I SHALL VOTE FOR SMART STAY. U LOOK AT THE PHONE THE VIDEO PLAYS. U LOOK AWAY IT PAUSE. UR PHONE CAN SCROLL UP N DOWN SEEING THE MOVEMENTS OF UR EYE BALLS. WE SHARE 700 MB MOVIES IN OFFICE EVERY WEEK IN JUST 2 T0 3 MIN OVER WIFI DIRECT WHICH SONY DOESNT HAVE. IN SHORT S4 IS PACKED WITH HELL LOT OF SENSORS. MOST 9F THESE THINGS EXIST IN NOTE 2 ALSO. MY PHONE TELLS ME THAT I HV A MISSED CALL OR MESSAGE WHEN I LIFT IT UP IN A HURRY AS IT VIBRATES WITH BEEPS IN MY HAND. PLUS S4 HAS 8 PROCESSORS. THERE ARE SEVERAL EXTRA ADVATAGES IN S4 WHICH ITS RIVAL DO NOT GIVE. PLEASE DO CHECK OUT LAB TEST REPORTS OVER THE NET LIKE GSMARENA.COM ETC TO GET BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HARDWARE ANE SOFTWARE POTENTIAL. THUS, THIS PHONE IS A AMAZING CHOICE BUT NOT THE BEST. HOPE THIS COMMENT W8LL HELP YOU."
Xperia Z,4,"I HAVE BEEN USING XPERIA Z FROM LAST 2 MONTHS AND I AM PRETTY SATISFIED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE.. I ADMIT THAT BATTERY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT ITS NOT BAD EITHER.. ALL THE HEAVY GAMES RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS.. THOSE WHO SAY S4 IS BETTER THAN XZ, I HAVE ONLY THING TO SAY.. LETS POUR A GLASS OF WATER ON BOTH AND THEN WE'LL TALK.. LOL.. IT IS VERY SLICK AND BEST LOOKING PHONE. IT HAS PREMIUM FEEL UNLIKE CREEPY PLASTIC PIECE OF SAMSUNG.. INITIALLY THERE WERE SOME ISSUES WITH THE OS BUT SONY HAS BEEN PROVIDING TIMELY UPDATES.. AND 4.2 JUST AROUND THE CORNER.. IT REALLY FEELS TO OWN THIS BEAST!!"
Xperia Z,4,"IT'S FAST, IT'S STURDY, APPS RUN VERY SMOOTHLY, CAMERA IS VERY GOOD (SOMETIMES GRAINY PICS BUT OTHERWISE OK), VIDEO RECORDING IS AWESOME, SCREEN IS VERY GOOD, BATTERY COULD'VE BEEN BETTER, BUNDLED APPS ARE OK.
      
      SHIPPING WAS FAST AS EXPECTED. THE LEATHER CASING AND  HEADPHONE ARE NICE ADDITIONS. OVERALL SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT."
Xperia Z,4,"LET ME FIRST STATE THAT I DON'T INTEND TO BE TECHNICAL HERE. TO ME PHONE IS A DEVICE WHICH CAN EASE YOUR LIFE. WHETHER ITS OPERATING SYSTEM IS JELLY BEAN DOESN'T MATTER TO ME. MY REVIEW WILL BE BASED ON ITS USE ONLY.
      
      
      THE PHONE HAS AN AWESOME LOOK. IT IS 10% SMALLER THAN GALAXY NOTE II MAKING IT EASIER TO HOLD. THE DISPLAY IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. THE CAMERA CLARITY IS SUPERB. BUT IT DOES CREATE A BIT OF PROBLEM WHEN THERE LIGHT IN THE BACK. THE PHONE HAS SPLIT SCREEN MEANING YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE 4 VIDEOS AT A TIME. FINALLY, A SMARTPHONE IS ALL ABOUT APPS. I PURCHASED THIS PHONE AS I WOULD LIKE TO TRADE IN OFFICE WITH THIS PHONE. THE PROCESSOR APPEARS QUITE FAST TO ME. APPS ARE INSTALLED IN SECOND. THE GOOGLE MAP AND NAVIGATION DESERVE A SPECIAL MENTION AMONG INBUILT APPS. IT IS BIT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PHONES. THE ONLY NEGATIVE THAT I FOUND IS THAT BATTERY DOES NOT LAST AN ENTIRE DAY ALSO THE SOUND IS BIT SHRILL. BUT THE HEADPHONE MAKES UP FOR IT.
      
      
      ONE THING THE PREMIUM CASE THAT YOU GET FREE HERE IS GIVEN BY FLIPKART AND IT HAS VERY BAD FINISH. IT DAMAGES THE BEAUTY OF THIS DEVICE. SO YOU HAVE TO BUY A NEW COVER. RATHER FLIPKART COULD SHARE A MEMORY CARD.
      
      
      AS ALWAYS FLIPKART DELIVERY IS TOO SEXY TO TELL ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT IT. GOT THE PHN IN ONE DAY.
      
      
      THIS PHONE FAR SURPASSES ANY OTHER PHN IN THE MARKET CURRENTLY BE IT I PHONE 5, GALAXY NOTE II FOR SIV(YET TO BE LAUNCHED). YOU CAN GO FOR IT. IT WILL BE AN INVESTMENT NOT EXPENSE."
Xperia Z,4,"PHONE IS OBVIOUSLY GREAT. REALLY A SMALL LAPTOP WITH ANDRIOD.
      
      IT HAS HEATING PROBLEM. ONLY 10 MIN OF TEMPLE RUN CAUSES HIGH HEAT AT CAMERA REGION. GENERALLY MOBILE PROCESSOR REMAINS AT BOTTOM BUT IN XPERIA IT MAY BE REMAIN IN UPPER PORTION.
      
      TAKES 5 HRS. FOR FULL CHARGE. CHARGE REMAINS 4 HRS. IF YOU SURF INTERNET IN 3G. IF YOU PLAY GAME CHARGE WILL REMAIN NEARLY 6 HRS.
      
      BUT CHARGER DOESN'T WORKS SOMETIME, TOTAL UNCERTAINTY. :( . THEN COMPUTER USB IS ONLY HOPE. I HEARD FROM ONE GUY THAT THIS IS OLD PROBLEM OF SONY."
Xperia Z,4,"PROS:
      
      1. PREMIUM LOOKS
      
      2. GREAT DISPLAY
      
      3. DECENT PROCESSOR (COMPARING WITH THE NEXT GEN SNAPDRAGON SERIES THAT THE OTHER PHONES HAVE ALREADY STARTED USING)
      
      
      CONS:
      
      1. HEATS UP FAST
      
      2. CAMERA TAKES TIME TO LOAD AND ALSO THE IMAGE QUALITY IS OKISH. HOPE THE SOFTWARE UPDATE SOLVES THE PROBLEM"
Xperia Z,4,"RECEIVED THE PHONE IN 3 DAYS IN JAIPUR
      
      VERY WELL PACKED
      
      SCREEN WORKS LIKE A DREAM. WATCHED "" BAND OF BROTHERS"" AND THE QUICK ACTION SCENES WERE VIVID &AMP; SMOOTH AS BUTTER
      
      THE SNAP DRAGON PROCESSOR IS AS FAST AS COULD BE. NO DELAYS NOTICED
      
      OVERALL VERY GOOD PHONE. MAYBE...JUST MAYBE THE PRICE COULD BE AROUND 30-32K WOULD MAKE IT TOP OF THE LIST"
Xperia Z,4,"SEE BROTHER ITS MY PERSONAL OPINION, EVERYONE HAS THEIR PERSONAL OPINION SO I DO..... I LIKE THIS PHONE DOESN'T MEAN U SHOULD ALSO LIKE IT AND THERE WILL NEVER BE 100 IN ANY PHONE, U GET BOTH PROS &AMP; CONS AND ABOUT UR INCIDENT I ALSO HAD THE SAME ISSUE AND DID SAME THING AS U DID BUT WE HAD TO KEEP IT FOR SUM HRS AND HERE IN Z NO NEED TO SWITCH OFF AND KEEP THE PHONE TO GET DRY........ I THINK UR HARDCORE FAN OF HTC OR SAMSUNG I HAVE USED BOTH THE COMPANY PHONES BUT COMPARING THEIR FEATURES PRICE IS QUIET HIGH, MY BROTHER HAS LG OPTIMUS G PRO AND PERFORMANCE WISE THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN HTC OR SAMSUNG, I HAVE USED ALL THE BRANDS AND BASED ON IT I HAVE WRITTEN THE REVIEW, U SHOULD ALSO CHECK OTHER BRANDS PHONE LIKE LG AND THEN U WILL LEARN HOW BETTER IT IS THAN HTC OR SAMSUNG..... SAMSUNG JUST HAS BRAND NAME BUT THEY ARE LACKING IN PERFORMANCE.........."
Xperia Z,4,"SONY SEEMS TO BE CATCHING UP WITH THE SMARTPHONES AND THIS PHONE IS REALLY AWESOME.
      
      
      FEW GOOD POINTS ABOUT THE PHONE:
      
      
      1. SCREEN IS RESPONSIVE
      
      2. BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD
      
      3. OVERALL PERFORMANCE IS AWESOME
      
      4. AS ALWAYS, SONY DOES BETTER IN MUSIC THAN PEERS.
      
      
      CONS
      
      PRICE OF THE PHONE IS PROBABLY HIGH WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER HIGH SELLING PEERS.
      
      
      OTHER THAN THAT NO ISSUES AND A GOOD PURCHASE"
Xperia Z,4,"THE PHONE IS A DARLING..BUT ITS VERY BAD IN TERMS OF EAR PIECE SOUND. ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR TO THE CALLER WHILE IN TRAFFIC. EVEN @HOME, MY FINGER AUTOMATICALLY PRESS THE VOLUME BUTTON HOPING IF THE VOLUME MAY INCREASE. SONY NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THIS. REST ARE BAZOOOKASSS....GREAT!!!! 2/5 OR THE SPEAKER AND MIC COMBO CLARITY...5/5 FOR THE REST!!!"
Xperia Z,4,"THE SERVICE FROM FLIPKART IS GOOD. I LIKE THE PHONE AS IT SUITES ALL THE OPTIONS I NEED. THE ONLY CONERN IS I HAVE A ISSUE WITH THE SOUND AND I HOPE FLIPKART WOULD LOOK AT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. GOOD CONNECTION, GOOD CAMERA AND GOOD SPEED. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SOUND . I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THIS IS WATERPROOF . HOWEVER THE SOUND IS VERY LESS EVEN THOUGH ITS WATER PROOF"
Xperia Z,4,"THIS IS TRUELY A MASTERPIECE FROM SONY !
      
      
      ABSOLUTELY AMAZING INTERFACE AND BEAUTIFUL INTERFACE.
      
      
      HERE ARE SOME PROS AND CONS I FOUND -
      
      
      PROS  -
      
      
      APPEALING DESIGN
      
      WATERPROOF AND DUST-RESISTANT
      
      POWERFUL QUAD-CORE PROCESSOR
      
      MICROSD CARD SLOT
      
      EXCELLENT CAMERA
      
      GREAT DISPLAY WITH 441 PPI
      
      
      CONS -
      
      
      FINGERPRINT MAGNET
      
      NO ANDROID 4.2 OUT OF THE BOX
      
      SOFTWARE BUTTONS ARE IRRITATING A LITTLE BIT !
      
      
      BUT I NEVER SUGGEST YOU TO BUY THESE COSTLY MOBILES.
      
      I PURCHASED TO DO THE REVIEWS ON PHONES AS IT IS MY JOB AND MONEY IS SPONSORED .
      
      
      THANK YOU , I HOPE YOU FIND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL :)"
Xperia Z,4,"TO START WITH I'LL JUST SAY I LOVE THE PHONE - THE FORM FACTOR, THE FINISH, THE STYLE STATEMENT AND THE 6.9 MM GIRTH WILL BLOW YOU AWAY THE MOMENT YOU HOLD IT. I LIKE ALL THINGS BLACK SO I GOT ME A BLACK ONE AND CAN?T STOP ADMIRING IT. THE PHONE IS ALMOST PERFECT BUT FOR A FEW QUIRKS AND HERE THEY ARE:
      
      1. I DO FEEL THE BATTERY CAPACITY IS INADEQUATE. THE PHONE SHOULD HAVE HAD AT LEAST 2600 MAH TO SCRAPE THOUGH THE DAY
      
      2. TIMESCAPE UI IS CLOSE TO STOCK UI - BUT SOME OF THE SKINNING IS STILL INTRUSIVE. ALSO, I LIKE DARK THEMES ON THE UI WHICH WILL HELP SAVE BATTERY LIFE - TIMESCAPE HAS QUITE A LOT OF APPS WITH BRIGHT BACKGROUND - DOESN'T HELP BATTERY LIFE
      
      3. ONE OF THE EDGES ON THE PHONE COULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM A LANYARD HOLE ! SINCE ITS WATERPROOF I WAS PLANNING TO TAKE ON BOARD A RAFT NEXT TIME I WENT RAFTING OR PARA SAILING OVER WATER
      
      4. THE 5 INCH SCREEN IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF REAL ESTATE. SONY COULD HAVE DOWNSIZED THE GRID TO HAVE ANOTHER ROW INCLUDED - THE SPACING BETWEEN ICONS IS AN ENORMOUS WASTE OF PRECIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL REAL ESTATE - MAYBE IT?S JUST ME THINKING THIS WAY
      
      5. YOU KNOW HOW ICONS GET GROUPED INTO A FOLDER ON THE HOME SCREENS IN JB 4.1.X - TIMESCAPE MESSED WITH IT AND THE RESULT IS A NOT SO IMPRESSIVE LOOKING FOLDER (ACTUAL FOLDER ICON). ALSO, THE HOME SCREEN INDICATOR DOTS ON THE TOP OF THE SCREEN ARE ANNOYING (THIS IS ME BEEN AN ANDROID PURIST)
      
      6. THE WIFI RADIO DOES SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM - CATCHES LOW SIGNAL EVEN IF THE ROUTER IS ONLY IN THE NEXT ROOM - HOPE THIS GETS FIXED BY A FIRMWARE UPGRADE
      
      7. EMAIL APP DOES NOT HAVE A CONVERSATION VIEW ! CREATES SUCH A CLUTTER. I PERSONALLY THING GOOGLE SHOULD MAKE THEIR OWN VERSION OF BB HUB / UNIVERSAL INBOX WITH CONVERSATION VIEW.
      
      
      THINGS THAT ARE REALLY COOL ABOUT THE XPERIA Z:
      
      1. LOVE THE MINIMALIST FORM FACTOR AND THE WATER-PROOFING
      
      2. WALKMAN APP IS AMAZING - INTEGRATES WITH GRACENOTE TO EDIT MUSIC INFO
      
      3. ABILITY TO THROW MULTIMEDIA CONTENT TO OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES - BLUETOOTH, TV ETC.
      
      4. SMALLAPPS ! THESE ARE SO CONVENIENT, I HOPE THEY MAKE MORE.
      
      5. POWER BUTTON ON THE SIDE ! AND WHAT A LOVELY POWER BUTTON IT IS.
      
      
      THINGS I THOUGHT I SHOULD WORRY ABOUT BUT DIDN'T BOTHER ME THAT MUCH:
      
      1. VIEWING ANGLES ? YES THEY ARE NOT GREAT, BUT IT?S NOT THAT BIG A BOTHER
      
      2. PHONE HEATING UP - IT CAN RUN A LITTLE WARM IF YOU ARE USING NETWORK DATA - BUT THEN AGAIN YOU CAN WASH IT IN COLD WATER !
      
      3. BIG FORM FACTOR - SOMETIMES IT CAN BE INCONVENIENT FOR SINGLE HAND USE - BUT YOU'LL SOON GET USED TO IT
      
      5. VOICE QUALITY - I READ BAD REVIEWS ABOUT IT, BUT FOUND IT TO BE JUST FINE ON THE PHONE.
      
      6. THE PORT COVERING FLAPS. THEY STILL ANNOY ME A LITTLE AT TIMES - FORTUNATELY YOU HAVE AN OPTION IN THE ZL
      
      
      IN SUMMARY ? I?M A VERY HAPPY XPERIA OWNER. HOWEVER, I?VE BEEN A LONG TIME MOTO ATIRX 2 / ICS USER AND DO MISS IT SOMETIMES ? MAYBE IT?S JUST SEPARATION ANXIETY ( SO LONG  MOTO .. :( )."
Xperia Z,4,"WHEN I SEE THIS PHONE I FALL IN LOVE? BUT WHEN I USE THIS PHONE MY LOVE WAS A BREAKUP.
      
      FIRST I TELL TO ALL ABOUT +POINTS:-
      
      1) THE PHONE LOOKS AWESOME.
      
      2) PERFORMANCE OF PHONE PROCESSOR AND RAM WAS GREAT.
      
      3) THE PHONE HANDLES SMOOTHLY ALL TYPES OF HEAVY GAMES AND APPLICATIONS.
      
      4) BUILT QUALITY IS SOLID.
      
      -POINTS ARE:-
      
      1) DISPLAY QUALITY WAS NOT GOOD BUT THE RESOLUTION IS GOOD.
      
      2) 13 MP CAMERA WAS TOTALLY POOR. SAMAUNG GALAXY S3 CAMERA WAS MUCH BETTER.
      
      3) DISPLAY CONTRAST QUALITY WAS VERY POOR ALSO ANGLE VIEW IS NOT GOOD.
      
      MY FINAL POINT:-
      
      IF WANT TO BUY THIS PHONE THEN WAIT FOR SOME DAYS. BECAUSE AT THE PRESENT PRICE THE PHONE WAS NOT GOOD. THIS PHONE WAS GOOD WHEN ITS PRICE WAS IN 26 TO 28 THOUSAND. SO IF YOU A SONY LOVER THEN GO FOR IT EITHER AT THE PRESENT S3 IS THE BEST DEAL."
Xperia Z,3,"A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD WRITE OFF THIS PHONE FOR A LOT OF REASONS OBVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT ITS COMPETITORS ARE USING PRETTY SAME SPECS BUT WITH BETTER PROCESSOR AND OS BUT THAT WOULD MEANS THIS PHONE IS EXPECTED TO BECOME CHEAPER. THIS HAPPENED WITH XPERIA S WHEN ITS PRICE REDUCED DRASTICALLY.
      
      BUT WHAT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IS THE XPERIA Z TABLET. ITS LOOKS REALLY GOOD. UNLESS THERE IS ANY OTHER TABLET TO COMPETE WITH IT THAT TIME ITSELF I AM DEFINITELY GOING FOR THAT!!"
Xperia Z,3,"ALTHOUGH THE DISPLAY IS FULL HD, THE COLORS ARE WASHED OUT AND THE DISPLAY IS PALE AND NOT THAT GREAT. OTHERWISE, THE PHONE IS A BEAST! ALSO, THE SNAPDRAGON S4 PRO IS BEING BEATEN BY THE SNAPDRAGON 600 IN THE HTC ONE AND THE EXYNOS 5 OCTA ON THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S4
      
      I WOULD WAIT FOR THE HTC ONE OR THE GALAXY S4 TO LAUNCH IN FLIPKART AND CHECK THEIR PRICE WITH THIS PHONE I WERE YOU BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM ARE A BIT SUPERIOR."
Xperia Z,3,"AS I AM USING THIS PHONE FROM 13.03.2013, THERE ARE FEW PRO'S AND CON'S I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE.
      
      
      PRO'S :
      
      
      NICE BODY.
      
      GOOD DISPLAY.
      
      GOOD VIDEO AND MUSIC CLARITY.
      
      GOOD CAMERA.
      
      AWESOME INTERNET BROWSING.
      
      
      CON'S :
      
      
      POOR BATTERY. (AS WE DON'T BUY PHONES FOR 39K JUST TO MAKE CALLS, WE LIKE TO PLAY GAMES, LISTEN MUSIC, PLAY MOVIES N ALL- IF YOU DO ALL THESE THINGS WITH YOUR PHN, DON'T BUY IT, YOU BETTER CARRY A CHARGER WITH YOU ALL THE TIME, AS IT WOULN'T LAST 5 HRS.)
      
      
      POOR ACCESSERIES AS PHONE COVER IS SO CHEAP, NOT WORTH RS. 100.
      
      
      PLEASAE NOTE : I HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED GALAXY NOTE 2, GALAXY S3, NOKIA LUMIA 800, XPERIA ARC S, IPHONE 4)
      
      
      I CHANGED FROM GALAXY NOTE 2 TO SONY XPERIA Z BECAUSE OF THE BUILT OF SAMSUNG'S PRODUCT IS CHEAP, AND THEY ALL LOOK SAME.
      
      
      NOT WORTH FOR 38K. (AS THIS IS THE CURRENT PRICE)."
Xperia Z,3,"BUY IT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS WATER PROOF.
      
      
      CONS:--
      
      
      OVER HEATING
      
      
      NO VIDEO CALL.
      
      
      ............................................................................................................................................................."
Xperia Z,3,CAMERA IS WORST IT WAS 13MP CAMERA BUT NO USE MY OLD PHONE NOKIA LUMIA 710 TAKES BETTER PIC THEN THIS.... VIEWING ANGLE SUCKS.... AND ITS 36K.... NO VALUE FOR MONEY.... ANDROID 4.1 MAKES IT GOOD OR ELSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WORST PHONE
Xperia Z,3,"EVERYTHING IN THIS PHONE IS GOOD BUT I PERSONALLY DINT LIKE THE QUALITY OF SCREEN I MEAN BLACK LEVELS JUST LOOK LIKE GRAY OTHER THAN THAT
      
      
      COOL LOOKING NICE SPECIFICATIONS
      
      GOOD CAM
      
      WATER RESISTANT
      
      
      I GOT THIS PHONE REPLACED AS FIRST I STARTED THERE WAS SOME SOFTWARE ISSUE JUST KEPT VIBRATING ... HOPE I GOT A DEFECTIVE UNIT"
Xperia Z,3,"I HAVE READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS REGARDING THIS PHONE.
      
      
      IT IS JUST ANOTHER DROID.
      
      LEAVE THE DROIDS AND MOVE TO NOKIA LUMIA 920 AT THIS PRICE RANGE, IT WILL JUST SURPRISE YOU IN EVERY WAY (EVERY GOOD WAY OFCOURSE), TRUST ME.
      
      
      GIVEN THE RATING JUST FOR ITS CONFIG, NOTHING MORE."
Xperia Z,3,"SONY BRAND AND ADS ARE GOOD SO IS THE WATER/DUST PROOF FEATURES
      
      BUT NOT THE DISPLAY . I FEEL THIS PHONE IS JUST A COPY OF OPTIMUS-G(E975  SAME HARDWARE AS NEXUS4 )   .
      
      
      SO BETTER TO BUY E975 OR IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY GO FOR HTC ONE
      
      
      ANOTHER OPTION IS WAIT FOR NEXUS 5 / OPTIMUS G PRO / G2
      
      
      GOOGLE THE REVIEWS AND VISIT ANY SHOPS AND USE THE PHONE BEFORE YOU BUY . DONT SEE JUST ADS"
Xperia Z,3,"SONY?S HANDSETS TEND TO FRUSTRATE ME MORE OFTEN THAN THEY PLEASE ME, SHOWING GLIMPSES OF GREATNESS LET DOWN BY SOME ANNOYING ISSUES. THE XPERIA Z, HOWEVER, GETS SO MUCH RIGHT THAT MY GRUMBLES SEEM ALMOST WILFUL. THESE BOIL DOWN TO A REQUEST FOR MORE MEMORY AND LESS APPLICATION BLOAT, WITH EVEN THE LATTER TEMPERED BY THE LOVELY SMALL APPS IDEA."
Xperia Z,3,"THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY FAST PHONE. IT IS FASTER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN THE COMPUTER I USE FOR DEVELOPMENT AT MY WORK PLACE. WITH A DROID YOU USUALLY EXPECT IT TO LAG SOMEWHERE BUT NOT THIS PHONE.
      
      
      IT'S INCREDIBLY FAST. THIS IS INDEED ONE OF THE BEST PHONES YOU CAN GET IN THE ANDROID WORLD TODAY. I TOOK THE PURPLE ONE. SETTING THE AMETHYST THEME IN IT MADE IT LOOK STUNNING.
      
      
      THE GUI IS BEAUTIFUL. I LIKE IT THAT SONY PUTS GOOD DEAL OF EFFORT INTO MAKING A GOOD LOOKING UI FOR THE ANDROID PHONE AND NOT SHOVE THE STOCK UI FROM GOOGLE'S ANDROID REPO.
      
      
      CAMERA IS ALRIGHT. THE PHONE TAKES INCREDIBLY BIG PHOTOS. I CAN'T SAY THEY ARE REALLY HIGH RESOLUTION THOUGH. THEY JUST SEEM LIKE REALLY BIG IMAGES THAT HAVE MODERATE LEVEL OF CLARITY.
      
      
      NOT A ""WASHED OUT"" SCREEN
      
      
      PEOPLE TOLD ME SOMETHING ABOUT THE PHONE'S SCREEN SEEMING ""WASHED OUT"" WHEN HELD IN A DIFFERENT ANGLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN. I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING. I HELD MY PHONE IN DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND I AM ABLE TO SEE THE SCREEN CONTENT JUST FINE.
      
      
      VERY BAD SOUND
      
      
      IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE IT A GOOD WATER PROOF PHONE (BECAUSE AT THIS DAY AND AGE IT IS VERY COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO GO SWIM WITH OUR PHONES IN 1M DEEP WATER BODIES) THEY'VE COMPLETELY SCREWED UP THE SOUND. THE MAJOR REASON I BOUGHT A SONY IS BECAUSE OF THE UNBEATABLE SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKER FROM MY ERSTWHILE XPERIA ARC. IF YOU MADE IT THIS FAR, YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I BOUGHT THIS PHONE - BECAUSE I LOST MY ARC AND I NEEDED A GOOD LOOKING STATE OF THE ART SMART PHONE.
      
      
      THAT'S DEFEATED.
      
      
      BUT THE SOUND QUALITY AND AUDIBILITY ON THIS PHONE IS PATHETIC. YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT, PLAYING MUSIC ON THE SPEAKER IS FUTILE  - YOU'RE BETTER OFF JUST SITTING IN SILENCE.
      
      
      I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED AT THIS. BUT IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE SOUND MUCH BUT NEED A FAST PHONE WITH LOT OF SPACE, THIS IS THE ITEM YOU'RE LOOKING FOR."
Xperia Z,3,"WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT MY XPERIA Z.
      
      1) BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY POOR.
      
      2) UPPER END OF THE PHONE GETS HEATED EVEN WITH 5-10 MINUTES OF USAGE.
      
      3) SPEAKER QUALITY IS SO POOR THAT I HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO PICKUP SOUNDS IN MODERATELY NOISY SURROUNDINGS.
      
      4) IT PLAYS MKV FORMAT, BUT WITHOUT SOUND.
      
      5) LASTLY ABOUT THE DISPLAY. IMAGES DO GET WASHED OUT IF THE VIEWING ANGLE IS CHANGED.
      
      6) CAMERA IS NICE, TAKES BEAUTIFUL PICTURES IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. BUT PICTURES SHOT IN IN LOW LIGHT ARE GRAINY."
Xperia Z,3,"WITH THE 10.1.A.1.434 THE SLEEP OF DEATH ISSUE HAS BEEN FIXED, SO I SAY HELLO TO THE EMPEROR'S REFURBISHED WARDROBE
      
      
      THE PROS - 1) GOOD GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE
      
      2) SOUND QUALITY
      
      3) CAMERA MAKES A GOOD JOB AS A PNS (POINT AND SHOOT) ALTERNATIVE
      
      4) BUILT IN SPEAKERS ARE DECENT
      
      5) NO HEADPHONE AMPLIFIER, BUT THE DSP DOES A DECENT JOB, SOUNDS POSITIVELY GREAT ON MY QUIET COMFORT 15
      
      6) INTERFACE IS CLEAN AND NO LAGS NOTICED
      
      THE CONS - 1) MIGHT KILL ITSELF ANYTIME (IF YOU HAVE A PHONE WITH THE 10.1.A.1.350 I URGE YOU TO LOOK FOR THE UPDATE TO 10.1.A.1.434)
      
      4) SCREEN COLOURS SEEM WASHED OUT, AND VIEWING ANGLES ARE NOT VERY WIDE
      
      5) NOT A VERY GOOD CONTRAST RATIO
      
      6) GETS HEATED, TO THE POINT OF ALMOST GIVING YOU A MILD FRIGHT OF BEING SCALDED IF PERFORMANCE IS PUSHED
      
      7) THE FREEBIES ARE LESS THAN QUALITY PRODUCTS
      
      8) MOST IMPORTANTLY - THE CAMERA APP HAS QUITE A LAG IN STARTING UP.
      
      
      OVERALL, WHEREAS I AM SATISFIED, NOT EVERYONE SHALL BE, C'EST LA VIE."
Xperia Z,3,"XPERIA Z IS A REALLLY GOOD PHONE!
      
      BUT THE ONE FLIPCART SELLS IS XPERIA Z - C6602, WHICH IS A NON LTE VERSION (ONLY 3G).
      
      I LEARNED IT THE HARD WAY, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FUTURE PROOF PHONE, YOU CAN BUY XPERIA Z C6603 FROM OTHER SELLERS."
Xperia Z,2,"GOT MY XPERIA Z FROM MARKET AND USING SINCE ONE WEEK
      
      
      REASONS TO NOT BUY :-
      
      1. BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY BAD ALSO FOR XPERIA ZL
      
      2. GETS HEATED VERY BADLY CANNOT KEEP YOUR CELL ON YOUR EARS EVEN FOR CALLING
      
      3. BATTERY IS TOTALLY DRAINED IN HEATING IT AND NOT  WORTH AT ALL
      
      4. AND IF U R LOOKING FOR A SMARTPHONE TO PLAY GAMES,MUSIC GO FOR GALAXY GRAND DUOS AND IF U WANT A GOOD CAMERA ALSO BUY ONE SONY CYBERSHOT WHICH I USED FOR 3 DAYS OF MY BROTHER AND JUST LOVED IT
      
      NOW AS IT IS HEATING BADLY MAYBE I WILL SELL MY XPERIA Z TOMORROW AND BUY ONE GRAND AND CYBERSHOT"
Xperia Z,2,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM SHOP NOT FROM FLIPKART ON DAY ONE... AFTER WAITING 4 DAYS FOR COVER AND HEADPHONE I AM DISAPPOINTED. THE COVER IS EXTREMELY CHEAP AND THE HEADPHONE IS JUST AVERAGE.
      
      I SWITCHED FROM ION TO XPERIA Z. XPERIA Z IS BEST .... BUT I THINK COMPANY SHOULD STOP PLAYING CHEAP GIMMICKS..."
Xperia Z,2,"I PURCHASED IT ON 23 APRIL AND TODAY IS 23 MAY..COMPLETED 1 MONTH..AND TODAY ITSELF MY PHONE HAS POWER ON ISSUE.SERVICE CENTER PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME TO WAIT FOR 1 DAY TO GET IT FIXED..SAD..
      
      
      POSITIVE POINTS.. AWESOME DISPLAY..PICTURE CLARITY IS GOOD..LIGHT IN WEIGHT..BEST PART WATER N DUST RESISTANT AND HAS ALL THE FEATURES OF A EXCELLENT SMART PHONE...
      
      
      NEGATIVE POINTS.. BIGGEST ISSUE GETS HEATED VERY QUICKLY..2ND MAJOR ISSUE..BATTERY,,EVEN IF BATTERY IS 100% GETS DRAINED OUT WITHIN 2 TO 3 HOURS.. A BIT OF SOFTWARE PROBLEM..LIKE WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED BUT IT CAN BE TAKEN CARE BY SERVICE CENTER PEOPLE.

Xperia Z,2,"WHAT IS THE USE OF A TOOL IF IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR REAL LIFE. JUST SHOWING PEOPLE THAT I TO HAVE A SMARTPHONE IS USELESS. PUT SOME 7K EXTRA AND REALIZE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF IOS.
      
      BUYING IPHONE 5 IS BETTER IF YOU NEED REAL FUNCTIONALITY.
      
      
      APPS: THE APPS IN APPS STORE IS THE BEST IN THE PLANET. THEY OFFER GREAT FUNCTIONALITY AND THEY ARE DESIGNED SPECIALLY FOR IOS UTILIZING THE FULL CAPACITY OF THE HARDWARE AND RETINA DISPLAY. WHERE AS ALL THE APPS IN GOOGLE PLAY ARE NOT DESIGNED  FOR XPERIA Z ONLY. THEY MIGHT CRASH IN THE MIDDLE AND SOME MIGHT NOT WORK PROPERLY. MOST OF THE POPULAR APPS ARE PRESENT ONLY IN IPHONE.
      
      
      OTHERS: FEATURES LIKE IBOOKS ARE UNBEATABLE. GO TO APPLE'S WEBSITE, READ IT'S FULL FEATURES AND MAKE A SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON. THEN YOU REALIZE IT DOES THINGS WHAT REALY PEOPLE WANT. I AM NOT AN APPLE RETAILER NOR CEO OF APPLE BUT DAMHARD IPHONE FAN.
      
      
      MEGAPIXELS  JUST REFER TO SIZE RATIO OF THE PHOTO AND 8 MP IS ENOUGH TO MAKE GOOD PHOTOS AND IPHONE CONTAINS HD AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDING. SOME COMPANIES JUST FOOL THE ORDINARY CUSTOMERS WITH SOME OUTSIDE FEATURES. NEARLY ANY ONE CAN MAKE PHONES WITH BIGGER SCREEN, BUT WHAT THE USE IF DOES'T LOOK LIKE A PHONE AT ALL AND FEELS LIKE A ROCK ON HAND. THE LIST GOES ON............GO SEARCH THE WEB!"

Xperia Z,1,"BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE, LOOK AT THE OFFICIAL SONY FORUM. IT IS FACING SOME SERIOUS BUGS AND ISSUES
      
      1. SUDDEN SLEEP OF DEATH
      
      2. WIFI SIGNAL DROPS
      
      3. LOW LOUDSPEAKER AND HEADPHONES VOLUME
      
      
      I CANNOT ADD THE LINK TO SONY FORUM SINCE FLIPKART IS NOT ALLOWING TO DO SO BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU ALL TO SEARCH ON GOOGLE AS "" XPERIA Z WIFI ISSUE"" OR "" XPERIA Z SLEEP OF DEATH"""
Xperia Z,1,"GOOD THINGS DON?T COME CHEAP? THINK ABOUT THE GOOD OLD NOKIA 3310. AGREED, IT WAS NOT A SMARTPHONE, BUT ITS DURABILITY WAS INDUBITABLE. ALSO, IT DID NOT COST AN ARM AND A LEG. KINGSHUK MUKHERJEE, A MARATHONER WHO USES A MODEST SAMSUNG CDMA THINKS THAT SPENDING A HUGE AMOUNT ON A SMARTPHONE IS UNNECESSARY. ?THE PURPOSE OF PHONE IS TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE AND THAT CAN BE DONE VIA A HUMBLE CDMA PHONE TOO. ALSO FOR A MARATHONER LIKE ME, A SMARTPHONE IS TOO DELICATE TO HANDLE,? HE SAID. TODAY THE TREND IS TO SUCCUMB TO APPLE JUGGERNAUT WHICH FORCES YOU TO SPEND ON THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF IPHONES, LATEST BEING THE IPHONE 5. IPHONE HAS A PASSIONATE FAN BASE THAT WOULD CONTINUE BUYING VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE PHONE WITHOUT SHOWING A SIGN OF MONOTONY.  LATEST ADD TO THE FANBOY LIST IS OF SENIOR COPY EDITOR OF A FINANCIAL PORTAL, SAGAR SALVI. ?IPHONE 5 IS ONE OF THE FEW ACCESSORIES ON A PERSON WHICH MAKES OTHERS TAKE A NOTE OF HIM,? SAID SALVI. WHEN ASKED IF IT WAS A SUPERFLUOUS PURCHASE, HE SAID, ?I THINK I COULD HAVE SAVED 10-15K, BUT I WANTED TO GO FOR THE BEST.?BUT EVEN IN THIS SMARTPHONE CONSUMER FRENZY MARKET, THERE ARE FEW WHO STILL SWEAR BY THEIR OLD NOKIA PHONES. 52-YEAR-OLD AJIT PARKAR, AN OFFICE SUPERINTENDENT AT RAILWAYS STILL USES A NOKIA 1208 MODEL. ?IT?S NOT THAT I CANNOT AFFORD AN IPHONE OR A SAMSUNG GALAXY PHONE, I FIND IT UNNECESSARY SPENDING ON IT. THOUGH I GOT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER, BUT FOR ME, I AM LOYAL TO NOKIA,? PARKAR TOLD US. 23-YEAR-OLD NEHA PINTO WHO RECENTLY GOT HER FIRST SMARTPHONE, HATES PHONES WHICH COST OVER 10K. ?I GOT A SMARTPHONE WHICH HAS ALL THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS AND IS UNDER 10K. I DON?T THINK ONE SHOULD PAY SO MUCH FOR A PHONE, UNLESS IT TELEPORTS YOU TO YOUR FAVOURITE DESTINATION,? SAID PINTO.BEFORE LETTING A SMARTPHONE BURN A HUGE HOLE INTO YOUR POCKET, YOU NEED TO ANSWER INTROSPECTIVE QUESTIONS LIKE, 'DO I REALLY NEED THAT EXPENSIVE PHONE?', 'AM I BUYING IT BECAUSE MY BOSS/FRIEND/COLLEAGUE HAS IT?? ?WHAT ELSE CAN I BUY IN THAT AMOUNT?? BE A SMART CONSUMER WHO NEVER FOLLOWS HERD MENTALITY. BE A SMART CONSUMER WHO NEVER FOLLOWS HERD MENTALITY"
Xperia Z,1,"GUYS, TRUST ME THIS IS REALLY A PIECE OF SHIT. PARDON MY LANGUAGE.
      
      THE DEVICE HEATS UP TO THE EXTENT THAT IT MAY BE USED FOR IRONING A LINEN/COTTON SHIRT (EVEN IN CALL TIMING OF MERE 2 MINUTES). NONE OF THE APPS COULD BE USED. ITS TERRIBLY COMPLICATED PLACEMENT OF SCREEN ARRANGEMENT EVEN.
      
      MY QUESTION FOR SONY IS GUYS IF THIS IS YOUR ""BEST OF SONY IN A SMARTPHONE"" THEN YOUR AVERAGE WOULD BE SUICIDAL. IN LAST 11 YEARS THIS WAS MY FIRST SONY DEVICE AND I SWEAR UPON ANYTHING THAT THIS WOULD BE MY LAST. IN JUST TWO MONTHS I WAS SO IRRITATED THAT I SOLD THIS SHIT ON QUIKR IN JUST 14K (BOUGHT IN 38K).
      
      
      MY GENUINE SUGGESTION TO ALL GUYS CONSIDERING THIS PHONE IS: PLEASE DROP THE IDEA. IF YOU STILL CONSIDER, LETS DO A BET OF 5000 IF IT DIDNT GET YOU IRRITATED IN JUST ONE MONTH. AND GOD BLESS YOU. 'COS IT HEATS UP TO THE EXTENT THAT EVEN IT MAY BLAST.
      
      
      THE ONLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT SONY EXPERIA Z IS:
      
      KATRINA IN ITS PROMO
      
      FLIPKART IN ITS SUPER DELIVERY SERVICE.
      
      
      REST ALL THE FEATURES SUCKS !!
      
      BI BI SONY FOREVER !!"
Xperia Z,1,"GUYZ BE PATIENT.
      
      I HAV BROUGHT XPERIA Z A 2 DAYS AGO[NOT FROM FLIPKART]
      
      I WAS SATISFIED. BUT THINK ABOUT IT JUST SPEND 2 -5 K MORE AND HAV PATIENCE U WILL GET THE BEST SMARTPHONE IN THE MARKET I.E. SAMSUNG GS4. U WATCH A VIDEO OF SGS4 ON UTUBE.
      
      U WILL SEE DAT IN VEDEO ONLY THE SGS4 SCREEN LOOK HD!
      
      I WAS SURPRISED.
      
      
      6 WAYS THE SGS4 BEATS XPERIA Z AND HTC ONE:
      
      1] SUPER AMOLED HD SCREEN[ DER IS A IMPROVEMENT]
      
      2] S FEATURES
      
      3] SCREEN SIZE
      
      4] BATTERY IZ D BEST
      
      5]ANDROID 4.2.2 [LATEST ANDOID VERSION]
      
      6]EASY TO ROOT [AS DER IS MORE DEVELOPMENT OF ROMS IN SAMSUNG DEVICES]

      SONY ARE YOU LISTENING???"
Xperia Z,1,HI GUYS MY NAME IS TEJA. I BROUGHT XPERIA Z LAST MONTH 14-04-2013. IT WAS WORKING FINE SUDDENLY YESTERDAY 25-05-2013 AT 5.00PM ITS POWER BUTTON IS NOT WORKING. SEARCHED INTERNET FOR SOLUTION AND THEY SAID TRY PRESSING POWER BUTTON+VOLUME UP KEY AT ONCE. I DID IT NOW MY POWER BUTTON NOT WORKING BUT VOLUME UP IS A POWER AND VOLUME ROCKER. AT 10.00PM THE PHONE WENT BLANK ITS NOT WORKING. WHEN I CONNECT TO CHARGER TOP NOTIFICATION LIGHT IN RED WAS FLASHING AND PHONE WAS VIBRATING LIKE (TRING TRING TRING RED NOTIFICATION LIGHT GOING ON AND OFF). THIS IS 2ND TIME BUYING BLOODY SONY MOBILE AND LOSING MY MONEY. PLEASE DON'T BUY IT. IF YOU WANT TO RISK GO HEAD AND BUY WITH INSURANCE AND EXTENDED WARRANTY.  AS TODAY IS SUNDAY I HAVE TO VISIT SERVICE CENTER TOMORROW 27-05-2013. AND SONY XPERIA Z LCD COLOUR IS LIKE TOO WHITISH BLACKS ARE NOT TOO GOOD. AND ONE MORE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS TOP LCD PORTION IS LIKE SCRACHED FROM INSIDE. BE AWARE BEFORE BUYING UPDATE YOU SOON ABOUT THE SERVICE OF SONY.
Xperia Z,1,"I AM A BIG FAN OF SONY ERICSSON (WHEN IT WAS) AND WAS OF SONY XPERIA UNTIL THIS INCIDENT TOOK PLACE.
      
      
      I DON'T OWN A XPERIA Z. BUT I HAVE SEEN AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT WORK PLACE. HE HAD BOUGHT THIS SONY XPERIA Z AND HAD USED IT HARDLY FOR A MONTH, WHEN, ONE NORMAL DAY, HE TOOK IT OUT OF HIS POCKET ONLY TO FIND A CRACK ON THE INSIDE OF THE DISPLAY. DURING THIS TIME, HE HAS NOT DROPPED HIS PHONE EVEN FROM THE MILDEST DISTANCE (I GUESS NO ONE WOULD, DURING THE FIRST MONTH OF A NEW PHONE). UPON VISITING THE SERVICE CENTRE AND CALLING THE CUSTOMER CARE, HE WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS A ""PHYSICAL DAMAGE"" AND WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. AND THAT HE HAD TO PAY HALF THE PRICE OF THE PHONE TO GET A REPLACEMENT. HOW MEAN IS THAT.
      
      
      SO STRANGE AS THIS CASE SEEMS, THIS CRACK, THE REASON FOR WHICH IS NOT YET KNOWN TO THE COMMON MAN, IS CLEARLY KNOWN BY SONY. PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND EVEN THE WORLD HAVE REPORTED THE SAME CASE, ALMOST IN THE SAME MANNER (DISPLAY CRACKED WHEN TAKEN FROM POCKET). BUT SONY PAYS NO RESPECT TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AND ALL HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE ONLY SINGLE OPTION, I.E. PAY HALF THE PRICE TO GET A NEW ONE (IT WAS SHOCKING TO KNOW EVEN IN THE US, A CUSTOMER CENTRIC COUNTRY, PEOPLE WERE TOLD TO PAY 500$ TO GET IT REPLACED). SONY STILL MANAGES TO SURVIVE WITH ITS ADVERTISING, IT IS BY NO MEANS A RESPECTABLE BRAND ANYMORE. IT IS JUST DANCING IN THE LIMELIGHT OF ITS RECENT SUCCESS. AM SURE XPERIA Z, THOUGH TOOK OFF WELL, WOULD FALL DOWN, AND, SO WOULD SONY."
Xperia Z,1,"I ONLY RECENTLY BOUGHT A NEW SONY XPERIA Z (ABOUT 2 MONTHS BACK). MY PHONE SUFFERED A CRACKED SCREEN FEW DAYS AGO WITHOUT EVEN A FALL. IT HAPPENED WEN I WAS OUT WITH MY FRIENDS. WE WERE USING THE GPS TO NAVIGATE AND WHILE I TRIED TO MOVE ALONG THE MAP, I NOTICED A CRACK AT THE TOP NEXT TO THE EAR PIECE.. AND AFTER A WHILE THERE WERE 2 MORE CRACKS FORMED. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT HAS CRACKED SINCE THE PHONE NEVER FELL DOWN! AND I EVEN USE A CASE TO PROTECT THE PHONE ...!! I HAVE ALWAYS OWNED SONY PRODUCTS. BEFORE THIS I USED A SONY XPERIA X8 AND THIS PHONE HAS WORKED FLAWLESSLY FOR MORE THAT 2 YEARS. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED TO SEE MY SXZ CRACK LIKE THIS.. WITHOUT ANY REASON.
      
      I WENT TO AN AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER IN CHENNAI TO CLAIM WARRANTY AND THEY REFUSED TO BELIEVE ME. THEY SAY IT HAS BROKEN DUE TO A FALL. I CANT BELIEVE THEY SIMPLY DISMISSED MY CLAIM WITHOUT EVEN A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE PHONE. THEY ARE ONLY READY TO REPLACE THE PHONE FOR MORE THAN 50 % OF ITS CURRENT MARKET VALUE.
      
      I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS FACED THIS ISSUE. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHO NOTICE THE SCREEN CRACKING ON TAKING IT OUT OF THEIR POCKETS ... PHONES ARE MEANT TO BE IN POCKETS ..I CANT BELIEVET SXZ CANT WITHSTAND EVEN THAT MUCH PRESSURE. IT TRULY IS A GREAT PHONE .. THE CAMERA IS GREAT, THE CALL QUALITY IS GOOD, IT LOOKS VERY BEAUTIFUL ... BUT THE FACT THAT IT HAS THE MOST SENSITIVE SCREEN COMPARED TO MANY OTHER PHONES MAKES IT AN UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. I WOULD ADVICE YOU ALL NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE COZ THE LIFE LINE OF AN SXZ IS MERELY 2-3 MONTHS... UPON THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE IT CRACKS.. OFCOURSE THERE ARE OTHERS WHO OWN THE SAME PHONE AND HAVE DROPPED IT MANY TIMES EVEN ON CONCRETE , YET THE PHONE SURVIVED... BUT DONT TAKE THAT RISK .! DO NOT BUY SXZ..!"
Xperia Z,1,"JUST LAST MONTH I BOUGHT ?SONY XPERIAZ?. TO MY SURPRISE, THE ?BRAND? EXPERIENCE DID NOT RESEMBLE THE ONE, FOR WHICH SONY IS KNOWN FOR.
      
      I DISCERNED AN ISSUE OF A BUG RELATED TO ?INABILITY OF CONNECTING TO GPRS? FOR WHATSAPP ON MY PHONE. NOW TODAY, I WAS CARRYING A CELL IN MY POCKET, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING MAJOR HAPPENED, BUT  I TOOK OUT THE CELL FROM MY POCKET, ONLY TO FIND THAT IT HAD A  CRACK ON THE ITS SCREEN AND A SHAKY VIEW ON THE SCREEN. THE PHONE IS JUST NOT USABLE IN ITS CURRENT STATE.
      
      
      THIS SHAKING ISSUE, HAS REALLY ?SHAKEN? MY FAITH ON SONY?S RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY (FOR WHICH THIS JAPANESE CONGLOMERATE IS KNOWN FOR). THE KIND OF PRICE I PAID (ABOUT 800 USD), DOESN?T JUSTIFY THE SOLID BUILT IT?S SUPPOSED TO HAVE."

      ANOTHER PROB I NOTICED TODAY IS, FOR SOME WEIRD REASON, THE LOCATION DOES NOT GET UPDATED AS FREQUENTLY AS SAMSUNG  SMART PHONES OR EVEN SONY EXPERIA U. I CHECKED SOME FORUMS AND IT SEEMS THIS IS A PROBLEM IN Z. :(
      
      
      TO SAY THE LEAST , I AM BIG TIME DISAPPOINTED...
      
      
      CAMERA: IN THE ADDS, THEY SHOW SUCH STUNNING PICTURES BEING TAKEN AT NIGHT, BUT IN REALITY, EVEN IN DAY, PICTURES ARE VERY AVG AT THE MAX. COLORS ARE NOT PICKED UP CORRECTLY AT ALL. LOW LIGHT IMAGERY IS HORRIBLE. THE 2 MP FRONT CAMERA GIVES SUCH NOISY IMAGES THAT I ACTUALLY WONDER IF ITS VGA CAMERA.
      
      
      SOUND: SOUND IS VERY LOW  EVEN AT MAX VOLUME AND THE QUALITY IS AGAIN VERY AVERAGE. GALAXY S2 OR  NOKIA LUMIA 820 (FROM MY FRIEND) ARE FAR BETTER THAN THIS WRT SOUND. IT WAS EMBARRASSING WHEN I WAS SHOWING IT OFF TO MY FRIENDS. THE SOUND IS COMPARABLE TO THE CHINESE MOBILES MY WATCHMAN OWNS.
      
      
      WIFI SIGNAL DROP: WHEN IN WIFI THE SIGNAL KEEPS ON DROPPING AT DROP OF A HAT. IT SEEMS THIS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM IN Z BUT SONY HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING YET TO RECTIFY IT. (LEARNED IT FROM FORUMS). IMAGINE WATCHING A YOUTUBE VIDEO AND THE SIGNAL KEEPS DROPPING. TAKE THE FUN OUT OF IT TOTALLY.
      
      
      I AM BIG TIME REPENTING ON MY DECISION TO BUY THIS TO MY WIFE AS A GIFT..!!
      
      I WISH THY HAD A NEGATIVE STAR RATING..!!"
Xperia Z,1,"WORST :
      
      
      ALWAYS KEEP ON SHUTTING DOWN WHEN LAUNCHING ANY APPLICATION,TAKING PHOTOS,MESSAGING FOR EACH AND EVERY THING
      
      
      MOBILE WILL HANG
      
      
      BUT THE SUPPORTPEOPLE ARE NOT RESPONDING PROPERLY, WORST SONY SUPPORT THEY KNOW ONLY RE-INSTALLING SOFTWARE BUT DONT KNOW ABOUT HARDWARE"
